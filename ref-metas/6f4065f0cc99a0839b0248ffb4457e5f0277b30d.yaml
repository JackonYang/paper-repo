paperAbstract: The exponential increase in the availability of online reviews and
  recommendations makes sentiment classification an interesting topic in academic
  and industrial research. Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult
  to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the
  problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained
  on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another.
  We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation
  for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this
  high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on
  a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this
  method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a
  larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains.
