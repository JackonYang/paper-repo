paperAbstract: "We present an approach for image retrieval using a very large number\
  \ of highly selective features and efficient learning of queries. Our approach is\
  \ predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual\
  \ \u201Ccauses\u201D and that images which are visually similar share causes. We\
  \ propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features\
  \ which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there\
  \ are over 46,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few\
  \ example images, and the AdaBoost algorithm is used to learn a classification function\
  \ which depends on a small number of the most appropriate features. This yields\
  \ a highly efficient classification function. In addition we show that the AdaBoost\
  \ framework provides a natural mechanism for the incorporation of relevance feedback.\
  \ Finally we show results on a wide variety of image queries."
