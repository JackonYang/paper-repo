paperAbstract: "Appearance features have been widely used in video anomaly detection\
  \ even though they contain complex entangled factors. We propose a new method to\
  \ model the normal patterns of human movements in surveillance video for anomaly\
  \ detection using dynamic skeleton features. We decompose the skeletal movements\
  \ into two sub-components: global body movement and local body posture. We model\
  \ the dynamics and interaction of the coupled features in our novel Message-Passing\
  \ Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Network. We observed that the decoupled features collaboratively\
  \ interact in our spatio-temporal model to accurately identify human-related irregular\
  \ events from surveillance video sequences. Compared to traditional appearance-based\
  \ models, our method achieves superior outlier detection performance. Our model\
  \ also offers \u201Copen-box\u201D examination and decision explanation made possible\
  \ by the semantically understandable features and a network architecture supporting\
  \ interpretability."
