paperAbstract: Abstract The general problem of visual search can be shown to be computationally
  intractable in a formal, complexity-theoretic sense, yet visual search is extensively
  involved in everyday perception, and biological systems manage to perform it remarkably
  well. Complexity level analysis may resolve this contradiction. Visual search can
  be reshaped into tractability through approximations and by optimizing the resources
  devoted to visual processing. Architectural constraints can be derived using the
  minimum cost principle to rule out a large class of potential solutions. The evidence
  speaks strongly against bottom-up approaches to vision. In particular, the constraints
  suggest an attentional mechanism that exploits knowledge of the specific problem
  being solved. This analysis of visual search performance in terms of attentional
  influences on visual information processing and complexity satisfaction allows a
  large body of neurophysiological and psychological evidence to be tied together.
