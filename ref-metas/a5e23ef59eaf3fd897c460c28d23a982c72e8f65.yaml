paperAbstract: This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised learning on
  high dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis
  learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide
  a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point
  x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby
  anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show
  that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear
  function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured
  by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning
  problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks
  of traditional local learning methods.
