paperAbstract: 'Scene text detection has attracted great attention these years. Text
  potentially exist in a wide variety of images or videos and play an important role
  in understanding the scene. In this paper, we present a novel text detection algorithm
  which is composed of two cascaded steps: (1) a multi-scale fully convolutional neural
  network (FCN) is proposed to extract text block regions, (2) a novel instance (word
  or line) aware segmentation is designed to further remove false positives and obtain
  word instances. The proposed algorithm can accurately localize word or text line
  in arbitrary orientations, including curved text lines which cannot be handled in
  a lot of other frameworks. Our algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance in
  ICDAR 2013 (IC13), ICDAR 2015 (IC15) and CUTE80 and Street View Text (SVT) benchmark
  datasets.'
