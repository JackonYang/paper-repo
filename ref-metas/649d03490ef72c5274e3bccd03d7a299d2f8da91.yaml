paperAbstract: Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical
  meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central
  to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a
  model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors
  capturing semantic term--document information as well as rich sentiment content.
  The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment
  information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize
  the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents
  (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and
  subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods
  for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset of movie reviews
  to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area.
