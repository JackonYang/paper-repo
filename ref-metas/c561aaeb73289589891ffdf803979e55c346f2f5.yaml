paperAbstract: Abstract We define and investigate the notion of a decomposable hypergraph,
  showing that such a hypergraph always is conformal, that is, can be viewed as the
  class of maximal cliques of a graph. We further show that the clique hypergraph
  of a graph is decomposable if and only if the graph is triangulated and characterise
  such graphs in terms of a combinatorial identity.
