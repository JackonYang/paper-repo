paperAbstract: "Humans have an amazing ability to instantly grasp the overall 3D structure\
  \ of a scene\u2014ground orientation, relative positions of major landmarks, etc.\u2014\
  even from a single image. This ability is completely missing in most popular recognition\
  \ algorithms, which pretend that the world is flat and/or view it through a patch-sized\
  \ peephole. Yet it seems very likely that having a grasp of this \u201Csurface layout\u201D\
  \ of a scene should be of great assistance for many tasks, including recognition,\
  \ navigation, and novel view synthesis.In this paper, we take the first step towards\
  \ constructing the surface layout, a labeling of the image intogeometric classes.\
  \ Our main insight is to learn appearance-based models of these geometric classes,\
  \ which coarsely describe the 3D scene orientation of each image region. Our multiple\
  \ segmentation framework provides robust spatial support, allowing a wide variety\
  \ of cues (e.g., color, texture, and perspective) to contribute to the confidence\
  \ in each geometric label. In experiments on a large set of outdoor images, we evaluate\
  \ the impact of the individual cues and design choices in our algorithm. We further\
  \ demonstrate the applicability of our method to indoor images, describe potential\
  \ applications, and discuss extensions to a more complete notion of surface layout."
