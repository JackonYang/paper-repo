paperAbstract: We present an estimate of an upper bound of 1.75 bits for the entropy
  of characters in printed English, obtained by constructing a word trigram model
  and then computing the cross-entropy between this model and a balanced sample of
  English text. We suggest the well-known and widely available Brown Corpus of printed
  English as a standard against which to measure progress in language modeling and
  offer our bound as the first of what we hope will be a series of steadily decreasing
  bounds.
