paperAbstract: We present a neural network-based face detection system. A retinally
  connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether
  each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to
  improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training,
  which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates
  the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must
  be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another
  state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance
  in terms of detection and false-positive rates.
