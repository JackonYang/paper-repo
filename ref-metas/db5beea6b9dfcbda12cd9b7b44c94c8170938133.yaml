paperAbstract: "Introduction. Let there be given a sequence of ordinates \n \n$$ \\\
  left\\{ {{y_n}} \\right\\}\\quad \\left( {n = 0, \\pm 1 \\pm 2, \\ldots } \\right),\
  \ $$ \n \ncorresponding to all integral values of the variable x = n. If these ordinates\
  \ are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation\
  \ between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to\
  \ compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are\
  \ known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem\
  \ is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree\
  \ k \u2014 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x)\
  \ only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining\
  \ ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained\
  \ which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd,\
  \ or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121).\
  \ Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic\
  \ function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate,\
  \ these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond\
  \ the intrinsic accuracy of the y n."
