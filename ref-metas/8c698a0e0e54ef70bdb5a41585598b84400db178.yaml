paperAbstract: The perception of depth involves monocular and binocular depth cues.
  The latter seem simpler and more suitable for investigation. Particularly important
  is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of
  the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings
  preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process
  is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using
  unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this
  end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When
  viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain
  correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material
  and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching
  of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first
  combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By
  this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed,
  and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and
  binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these
  and other findings are presented.
