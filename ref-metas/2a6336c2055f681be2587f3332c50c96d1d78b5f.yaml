paperAbstract: We develop an intermediate representation for deformable part models
  and show that this representation has favorable performance characteristics for
  multi-class problems when the number of classes is high. Our model uses sparse coding
  of part filters to represent each filter as a sparse linear combination of shared
  dictionary elements. This leads to a universal set of parts that are shared among
  all object classes. Reconstruction of the original part filter responses via sparse
  matrix-vector product reduces computation relative to conventional part filter convolutions.
  Our model is well suited to a parallel implementation, and we report a new GPU DPM
  implementation that takes advantage of sparse coding of part filters. The speed-up
  offered by our intermediate representation and parallel computation enable real-time
  DPM detection of 20 different object classes on a laptop computer.
