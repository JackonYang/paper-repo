paperAbstract: 'Table detection is an important task in the field of document analysis.
  It has been extensively studied since a couple of decades. Various kinds of document
  mediums are involved, from scanned images to web pages, from plain texts to PDF
  files. Numerous algorithms published bring up a challenging issue: how to evaluate
  algorithms in different context. Currently, most work on table detection conducts
  experiments on their in-house dataset. Even the few sources of online datasets are
  targeted at image documents only. Moreover, Precision and recall measurement are
  usual practice in order to account performance based on human evaluation. In this
  paper, we provide a dataset that is representative, large and most importantly,
  publicly available. The compatible format of the ground truth makes evaluation independent
  of document medium. We also propose a set of new measures, implement them, and open
  the source code. Finally, three existing table detection algorithms are evaluated
  to demonstrate the reliability of the dataset and metrics.'
