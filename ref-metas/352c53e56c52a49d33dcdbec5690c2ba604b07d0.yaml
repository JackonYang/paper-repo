paperAbstract: 'We investigated the computational properties of natural object hierarchy
  in the context of constellation object class models, and its utility for object
  class recognition. We first observed an interesting computational property of the
  object hierarchy: comparing the recognition rate when using models of objects at
  different levels, the higher more inclusive levels (e.g., closed-frame vehicles
  or vehicles) exhibit higher recall but lower precision when compared with the class
  specific level (e.g., bus). These inherent differences suggest that combining object
  classifiers from different hierarchical levels into a single classifier may improve
  classification, as it appears like these models capture different aspects of the
  object. We describe a method to combine these classifiers, and analyze the conditions
  under which improvement can be guaranteed. When given a small sample of a new object
  class, we describe a method to transfer knowledge across the tree hierarchy, between
  related objects. Finally, we describe extensive experiments using object hierarchies
  obtained from publicly available datasets, and show that the combined classifiers
  significantly improve recognition results.'
