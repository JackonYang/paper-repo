paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning method for
  page segmentation of historical handwritten documents available as color images.
  We consider page segmentation as a pixel labeling problem, i.e., each pixel is classified
  as either periphery, background, text block, or decoration. Traditional methods
  in this area rely on carefully hand-crafted features or large amounts of prior knowledge.
  In contrast, we apply convolutional autoencoders to learn features directly from
  pixel intensity values. Then, using these features to train an SVM, we achieve high
  quality segmentation without any assumption of specific topologies and shapes. Experiments
  on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
  approach.
