paperAbstract: Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous
  real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they
  are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance.
  In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. Instead
  of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled
  instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new
  algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an
  algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical
  motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental
  results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce
  the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive
  settings.
