paperAbstract: "Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology-Frank Y. Shih 2009-03-23\
  \ In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing\
  \ and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated\
  \ vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern\
  \ recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp\
  \ of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can\
  \ provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing\
  \ and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive,\
  \ wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation\
  \ to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information,\
  \ the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers\
  \ analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel\
  \ ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed\
  \ plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and\
  \ state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous\
  \ practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other\
  \ tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes\
  \ an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new\
  \ algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own\
  \ solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify\
  \ problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the\
  \ necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and\
  \ applications, as well as create new ones."
