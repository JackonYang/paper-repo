paperAbstract: Object detection is one of the key components in modern computer vision
  systems. While the detection of a specific rigid object under changing viewpoints
  was considered hard just a few years ago, current research strives to detect and
  recognize classes of non-rigid, articulated objects. Hampered by the omnipresent
  confusing information due to clutter and occlusion, the focus has shifted from holistic
  approaches for object detection to representations of individual object parts linked
  by structural information, along with richer contextual descriptions of object configurations.
  Along this line of research, we present a practicable and expandable probabilistic
  framework for parts-based object class representation, enabling the detection of
  rigid and articulated object classes in arbitrary views. We investigate learning
  of this representation from labelled training images and infer globally optimal
  solutions to the contextual MAP-detection problem, using A*-search with a novel
  lower-bound as admissible heuristic. An assessment of the inference performance
  of Belief-Propagation and Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation is obtained as a by-product.
  The generality of our approach is demonstrated on four different datasets utilizing
  domain dependent information cues.
