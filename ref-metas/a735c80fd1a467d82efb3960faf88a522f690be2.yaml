paperAbstract: A feature-based approach to face recognition in which the features
  are derived from the intensity data without assuming any knowledge of the face structure
  is presented. The feature extraction model is biologically motivated, and the locations
  of the features often correspond to salient facial features such as the eyes, nose,
  etc. Topological graphs are used to represent relations between features, and a
  simple deterministic graph-matching scheme that exploits the basic structure is
  used to recognize familiar faces from a database. Each of the stages in the system
  can be fully implemented in parallel to achieve real-time recognition. Experimental
  results for a 128*128 image with very little noise are evaluated.<<ETX>>
