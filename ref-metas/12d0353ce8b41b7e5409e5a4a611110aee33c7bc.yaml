paperAbstract: We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but
  by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.
  Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively
  outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods
  we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines)
  do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based
  categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification
  problem more challenging.
