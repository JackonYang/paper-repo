paperAbstract: Data often consists of multiple diverse modalities. For example, images
  are tagged with textual information and videos are accompanied by audio. Each modality
  is characterized by having distinct statistical properties. We propose a Deep Boltzmann
  Machine for learning a generative model of such multimodal data. We show that the
  model can be used to create fused representations by combining features across modalities.
  These learned representations are useful for classification and information retrieval.
  By sampling from the conditional distributions over each data modality, it is possible
  to create these representations even when some data modalities are missing. We conduct
  experiments on bimodal image-text and audio-video data. The fused representation
  achieves good classification results on the MIR-Flickr data set matching or outperforming
  other deep models as well as SVM based models that use Multiple Kernel Learning.
  We further demonstrate that this multimodal model helps classification and retrieval
  even when only unimodal data is available at test time.
