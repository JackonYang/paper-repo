paperAbstract: In many computer vision classification problems, both the error and
  time characterizes the quality of a decision. We show that such problems can be
  formalized in the framework of sequential decision-making. If the false positive
  and false negative error rates are given, the optimal strategy in terms of the shortest
  average time to decision (number of measurements used) is the Wald's sequential
  probability ratio test (SPRT). We built on the optimal SPRT test and enlarge its
  capabilities to problems with dependent measurements. We show how to overcome the
  requirements of SPRT - (i) a priori ordered measurements and (ii) known joint probability
  density functions. We propose an algorithm with near optimal time and error rate
  trade-off, called WaldBoost, which integrates the AdaBoost algorithm for measurement
  selection and ordering and the joint probability density estimation with the optimal
  SPRT decision strategy. The WaldBoost algorithm is tested on the face detection
  problem. The results are superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the average
  evaluation time and comparable in detection rates.
