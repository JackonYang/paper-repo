paperAbstract: 'The problem of recognizing text in images taken in the wild has gained
  significant attention from the computer vision community in recent years. Contrary
  to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem.
  We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images
  and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the
  recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong
  context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework
  that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize
  a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results
  on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word
  dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates
  higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained
  manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an
  English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement
  (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list.
  (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other
  public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it.'
