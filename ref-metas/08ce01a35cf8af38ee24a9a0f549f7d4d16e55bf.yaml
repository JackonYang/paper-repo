paperAbstract: Four independently, developed expert algorithms for recognizing unconstrained
  handwritten numerals are presented. All have high recognition rates. Different experimental
  approaches for incorporating these recognition methods into a more powerful system
  are also presented. The resulting multiple-expert system proves that the consensus
  of these methods tends to compensate for individual weaknesses, while preserving
  individual strengths. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution
  rate to a desired level while maintaining a fairly high recognition rate in the
  classification of totally unconstrained handwritten ZIP code numerals. If reliability
  is of the utmost importance, substitutions can be avoided completely (reliability=100%)
  while retaining a recognition rate above 90%. Results are compared with those for
  some of the most effective numeral recognition systems found in the literature.
