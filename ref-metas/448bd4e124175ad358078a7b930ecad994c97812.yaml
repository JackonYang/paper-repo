paperAbstract: 'We present a general example-based framework for detecting objects
  in static images by components. The technique is demonstrated by developing a system
  that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct
  example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components
  of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that
  these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based
  classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern
  as either a "person" or a "nonperson." We call this type of hierarchical architecture,
  in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers
  (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better
  than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in
  performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification
  architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection
  method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and
  people whose body parts have little contrast with the background.'
