paperAbstract: "This paper shows how a text classifier\u2019s need for labeled training\
  \ documents can be reduced by taking advantage of a large pool of unlabeled documents.\
  \ We modify the Query-by-Committee (QBC) method of active learning to use the unlabeled\
  \ pool for explicitly estimating document density when selecting examples for labeling.\
  \ Then active learning is combined with ExpectationMaximization in order to \u201C\
  fill in\u201D the class labels of those documents that remain unlabeled. Experimental\
  \ results show that the improvements to active learning require less than two-thirds\
  \ as many labeled training examples as previous QBC approaches, and that the combination\
  \ of EM and active learning requires only slightly more than half as many labeled\
  \ training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either the improved active learning\
  \ or EM alone."
