paperAbstract: Local space-time features capture local events in video and can be
  adapted to the size, the frequency and the velocity of moving patterns. In this
  paper, we demonstrate how such features can be used for recognizing complex motion
  patterns. We construct video representations in terms of local space-time features
  and integrate such representations with SVM classification schemes for recognition.
  For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391
  sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios.
  The presented results of action recognition justify the proposed method and demonstrate
  its advantage compared to other relative approaches for action recognition.
