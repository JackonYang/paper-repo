paperAbstract: An experimental printed-page reader that is easy to adapt to various
  languages is described. Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes
  in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and
  imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of
  variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has
  been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary
  combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been
  made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic
  learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has
  been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be
  exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner,
  so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be
  applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan,
  and special technical texts. >
