paperAbstract: "Descriptions of physical properties of visible surfaces, such as their\
  \ distance and the presence of edges, must be recovered from the primary image data.\
  \ Computational vision aims to understand how such descriptions can be obtained\
  \ from inherently ambiguous and noisy data. A recent development in this field sees\
  \ early vision as a set of ill-posed problems, which can be solved by the use of\
  \ regularization methods. These lead to algorithms and parallel analog circuits\
  \ that can solve \u2018ill-posed problems\u2019 and which are suggestive of neural\
  \ equivalents in the brain."
