paperAbstract: Text detection in video frames plays a vital role in enhancing the
  performance of information extraction systems because the text in video frames helps
  in indexing and retrieving video efficiently and accurately. This paper presents
  a new method for arbitrarily-oriented text detection in video, based on dominant
  text pixel selection, text representatives and region growing. The method uses gradient
  pixel direction and magnitude corresponding to Sobel edge pixels of the input frame
  to obtain dominant text pixels. Edge components in the Sobel edge map corresponding
  to dominant text pixels are then extracted and we call them text representatives.
  We eliminate broken segments of each text representatives to get candidate text
  representatives. Then the perimeter of candidate text representatives grows along
  the text direction in the Sobel edge map to group the neighboring text components
  which we call word patches. The word patches are used for finding the direction
  of text lines and then the word patches are expanded in the same direction in the
  Sobel edge map to group the neighboring word patches and to restore missing text
  information. This results in extraction of arbitrarily-oriented text from the video
  frame. To evaluate the method, we considered arbitrarily-oriented data, non-horizontal
  data, horizontal data, Hua's data and ICDAR-2003 competition data (Camera images).
  The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing
  method in terms of recall and f-measure.
