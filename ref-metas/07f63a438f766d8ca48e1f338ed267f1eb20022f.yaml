paperAbstract: The state of the art in handwriting recognition, especially in cursive
  word recognition, is surveyed, and some basic notions are reviewed in the field
  of picture recognition, particularly, line image recognition. The usefulness of
  'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied
  to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the
  regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts
  of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation
  of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or
  more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate
  words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results
  are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >
