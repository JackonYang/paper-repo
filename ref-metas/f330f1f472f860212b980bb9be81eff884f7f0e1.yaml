paperAbstract: We introduce a novel kernel for comparing two text documents. The kernel
  is an inner product in the feature space consisting of all subsequences of length
  k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though
  not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially
  decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences
  which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would
  involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the
  dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how
  despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming
  technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel
  compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging
  results.
