paperAbstract: Recognizing objects in fine-grained domains can be extremely challenging
  due to the subtle differences between subcategories. Discriminative markings are
  often highly localized, leading traditional object recognition approaches to struggle
  with the large pose variation often present in these domains. Pose-normalization
  seeks to align training exemplars, either piecewise by part or globally for the
  whole object, effectively factoring out differences in pose and in viewing angle.
  Prior approaches relied on computationally-expensive filter ensembles for part localization
  and required extensive supervision. This paper proposes two pose-normalized descriptors
  based on computationally-efficient deformable part models. The first leverages the
  semantics inherent in strongly-supervised DPM parts. The second exploits weak semantic
  annotations to learn cross-component correspondences, computing pose-normalized
  descriptors from the latent parts of a weakly-supervised DPM. These representations
  enable pooling across pose and viewpoint, in turn facilitating tasks such as fine-grained
  recognition and attribute prediction. Experiments conducted on the Caltech-UCSD
  Birds 200 dataset and Berkeley Human Attribute dataset demonstrate significant improvements
  of our approach over state-of-art algorithms.
