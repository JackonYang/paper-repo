paperAbstract: Paraphrase detection is the task of examining two sentences and determining
  whether they have the same meaning. In order to obtain high accuracy on this task,
  thorough syntactic and semantic analysis of the two statements is needed. We introduce
  a method for paraphrase detection based on recursive autoencoders (RAE). Our unsupervised
  RAEs are based on a novel unfolding objective and learn feature vectors for phrases
  in syntactic trees. These features are used to measure the word- and phrase-wise
  similarity between two sentences. Since sentences may be of arbitrary length, the
  resulting matrix of similarity measures is of variable size. We introduce a novel
  dynamic pooling layer which computes a fixed-sized representation from the variable-sized
  matrices. The pooled representation is then used as input to a classifier. Our method
  outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging MSRP paraphrase
  corpus.
