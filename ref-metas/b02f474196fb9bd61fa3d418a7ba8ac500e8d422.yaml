paperAbstract: "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending\
  \ on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing\
  \ them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing\
  \ unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin\
  \ (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing\
  \ image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation.\
  \ Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address\
  \ the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This\
  \ article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework\
  \ is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image\
  \ data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different\
  \ combinations of \u03B3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond\
  \ to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used\
  \ as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt\
  \ the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed\
  \ approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour\
  \ of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration\
  \ with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world\
  \ and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different\
  \ types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism\
  \ and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described\
  \ in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection,\
  \ junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In\
  \ many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision\
  \ modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms\
  \ for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems\
  \ to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."
