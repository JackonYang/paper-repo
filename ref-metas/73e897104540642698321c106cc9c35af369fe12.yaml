paperAbstract: 'The are two main approaches to the representation of meaning in Computational
  Linguistics: a symbolic approach and a distributional approach. This paper considers
  the fundamental question of how these approaches might be combined. The proposal
  is to adapt a method from the Cognitive Science literature, in which symbolic and
  connectionist representations are combined using tensor products. Possible applications
  of this method for language processing are described. Finally, a potentially fruitful
  link between Quantum Mechanics, Computational Linguistics, and other related areas
  such as Information Retrieval and Machine Learning, is proposed.'
