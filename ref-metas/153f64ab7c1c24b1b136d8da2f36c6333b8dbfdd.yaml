paperAbstract: "In pattern recognition, statistical modeling, or regression, the amount\
  \ of data is the most critical factor affecting the performance. If the amount of\
  \ data and computational resources are near infinite, many algorithmes will probably\
  \ converge to the optimal solution. When this is not the case, one has to introduce\
  \ regularizers and a-priori knowledge to supplement the available data in order\
  \ to boost the performance. Invariance (or known dependance) with respect to transformation\
  \ of the input is a frequent occurrence of such an a-priori knowledge. In this chapter,\
  \ we introduce the concept of tangent vectors, which compactly represent the essence\
  \ of these transformation invariances, and two classes of algorithms, \u201CTangent\
  \ distance\u201D and \u2018Tangent propagation\u201D, which make use of these invariances\
  \ to improve performance."
