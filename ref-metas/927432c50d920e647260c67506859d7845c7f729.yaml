paperAbstract: "Detecting objects in cluttered scenes and estimating articulated human\
  \ body parts are two challenging problems in computer vision. The difficulty is\
  \ particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g.\
  \ playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially\
  \ visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however,\
  \ that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013\
  \ recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose\
  \ a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses\
  \ in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as\
  \ a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the\
  \ object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through\
  \ a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by\
  \ a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object\
  \ interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms\
  \ state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."
