paperAbstract: "We address the problem of visual category recognition by learning\
  \ an image-to-image distance function that attempts to satisfy the following property:\
  \ the distance between images from the same category should be less than the distance\
  \ between images from different categories. We use patch-based feature vectors common\
  \ in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions.\
  \ Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to\
  \ formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning,\
  \ however we differ in that we learn local distance functions\xBFa different parameterized\
  \ function for every image of our training set\xBFwhereas typically a single global\
  \ distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome,\
  \ Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions\
  \ independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test\
  \ time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a\
  \ different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that\
  \ are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of\
  \ retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights\
  \ assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer\
  \ vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more\
  \ salient depends on the category, or image, being considered. We train and test\
  \ using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark."
