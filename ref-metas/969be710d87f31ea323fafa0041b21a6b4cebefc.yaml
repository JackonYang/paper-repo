paperAbstract: 'The notion of using context information for solving high-level vision
  problems has been increasingly realized in the field. However, how to learn an effective
  and efficient context model, together with the image appearance, remains mostly
  unknown. The current literature using Markov random fields (MRFs) and conditional
  random fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design, in which the modeling
  and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose an auto-context
  algorithm. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we
  first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability
  (or classification confidence) maps by the learned classifier are then used as context
  information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier.
  The algorithm then iterates to approach the ground truth. Auto-context learns an
  integrated low-level and context model, and is very general and easy to implement.
  Under nearly the identical parameter setting in the training, we apply the algorithm
  on three challenging vision applications: object segmentation, human body configuration,
  and scene region labeling. It typically takes about 30 ~ 70 seconds to run the algorithm
  in testing. Moreover, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond high-level
  vision. It has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems of multi-variate
  labeling.'
