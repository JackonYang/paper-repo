paperAbstract: 'ach designer of interactive systems evolves, of necessity, a set of
  precepts for the creation of user-friendly systems. Examples are: use menus, no
  more than seven choices, maintain a consistent format, develop error responses that
  do not provoke anxiety [ZO] Research findings are used to support and guide the
  development of these and the many othrr existing prrrrpts. Although it may not be
  immediately apparent, such precepts arise from one basic all-encompassing guideline:
  An interface which is as attractive and useful as possible is modeled so that it
  flows in parallel with the cognitive expectations (conxious and unconscious) of
  the target users. The aurhors label the design of systems so they proceed and interact
  with the user in a manner parallel to the flow of the user''s own thol$lt processes
  " Cognitive I\latch Interfaw Design " (COMIND 151). The goal is to make the interface
  an extension of the user so its use requires (like a hand or an eye) no conscious
  attention. The user is empowered to focus his/her entire concentration on the problem
  at hand. Pieceby-piece investigators and designers accumulate, by means of research
  rxperimena, human/computer interface findings, and use these findings to build interfaces
  of &rr increasing user friendliness. It is expected that the culmination of these
  advances will be the creation of computer systems that can tailor themselves to
  a user''s specific ps~chological/expertis~ profile. The experiment described in
  this article was performed within the framprvork described earlier. Although large
  ~luns are spent by industy for the purchase of tabular and graphic display packages,
  and although important decisions are regularly made based on data organized by mrans
  of such packages, little uncontested knowledge is availahlr concerning the relative
  rffcacy of tables and the various lorms of graphs. A consensus is that the literature
  iy in disarray.'
