paperAbstract: This paper introduces a product quantization-based approach for approximate
  nearest neighbor search. The idea is to decompose the space into a Cartesian product
  of low-dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. A vector
  is represented by a short code composed of its subspace quantization indices. The
  euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes.
  An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance
  between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches
  for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted
  file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy,
  outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach
  is validated on a data set of two billion vectors.
