paperAbstract: Because of the better performance of deep learning on many computer
  vision tasks, researchers in the area of document analysis and recognition begin
  to adopt this technique into their work. In this paper, we propose a novel method
  for table detection in PDF documents based on convolutional neutral networks, one
  of the most popular deep learning models. In the proposed method, some table-like
  areas are selected first by some loose rules, and then the convolutional networks
  are built and refined to determine whether the selected areas are tables or not.
  Besides, the visual features of table areas are directly extracted and utilized
  through the convolutional networks, while the non-visual information (e.g. characters,
  rendering instructions) contained in original PDF documents is also taken into consideration
  to help achieve better recognition results. The primary experimental results show
  that the approach is effective in table detection.
