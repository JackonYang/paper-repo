paperAbstract: This paper presents the Sixth Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-6)
  challenge. This year a major innovation was introduced, as the traditional Main
  Task was replaced by a new task, similar to the RTE-5 Search Pilot, in which Textual
  Entailment is performed on a real corpus in the Update Summarization scenario. A
  subtask was also proposed, aimed at detecting novel information. To continue the
  effort of testing RTE in NLP applications, a KBP Validation Pilot Task was set up,
  in which RTE systems had to validate the output of systems participating in the
  KBP Slot Filling Task. Eighteen teams participated in the Main Task (48 submitted
  runs) and 9 in the Novelty Detection Subtask (22 submitted runs). As for the Pilot,
  10 runs were submitted by 3 participants. Finally, the exploratory effort started
  in RTE-5 to perform resource evaluation through ablation tests was not only reiterated
  in RTE-6, but also extended to tools.
