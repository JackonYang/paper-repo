paperAbstract: Scene text recognition is a useful but very challenging task due to
  uncontrolled condition of text in natural scenes. This paper presents a novel approach
  to recognize text in scene images. In the proposed technique, a word image is first
  converted into a sequential column vectors based on Histogram of Oriented Gradient
  (HOG). The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is then adapted to classify the sequential
  feature vectors into the corresponding word. Compared with most of the existing
  methods that follow a bottom-up approach to form words by grouping the recognized
  characters, our proposed method is able to recognize the whole word images without
  character-level segmentation and recognition. Experiments on a number of publicly
  available datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
  techniques significantly. In addition, the recognition results on publicly available
  datasets provide a good benchmark for the future research in this area.
