paperAbstract: We present a new way of extending independent components analysis (ICA)
  to overcomplete representations. In contrast to the causal generative extensions
  of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic
  (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies
  among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs.
  By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input
  states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model
  are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the
  number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based
  model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning
  algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional
  experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various
  standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces.
