paperAbstract: 'This paper considers the task of articulated human pose estimation
  of multiple people in real world images. We propose an approach that jointly solves
  the tasks of detection and pose estimation: it infers the number of persons in a
  scene, identifies occluded body parts, and disambiguates body parts between people
  in close proximity of each other. This joint formulation is in contrast to previous
  strategies, that address the problem by first detecting people and subsequently
  estimating their body pose. We propose a partitioning and labeling formulation of
  a set of body-part hypotheses generated with CNN-based part detectors. Our formulation,
  an instance of an integer linear program, implicitly performs non-maximum suppression
  on the set of part candidates and groups them to form configurations of body parts
  respecting geometric and appearance constraints. Experiments on four different datasets
  demonstrate state-of-the-art results for both single person and multi person pose
  estimation.'
