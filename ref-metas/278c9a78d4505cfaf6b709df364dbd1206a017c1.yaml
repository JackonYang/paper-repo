paperAbstract: 'A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model
  to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing
  data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited
  for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the
  data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes
  the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an
  image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in
  space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new
  results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution,
  and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed
  form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the
  LDP under difficult viewing'
