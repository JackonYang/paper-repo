paperAbstract: Over the last decade, the availability of public image repositories
  and recognition benchmarks has enabled rapid progress in visual object category
  and instance detection. Today we are witnessing the birth of a new generation of
  sensing technologies capable of providing high quality synchronized videos of both
  color and depth, the RGB-D (Kinect-style) camera. With its advanced sensing capabilities
  and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to
  dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and
  interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical
  multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains
  300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to
  the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology.
  This paper describes the dataset collection procedure and introduces techniques
  for RGB-D based object recognition and detection, demonstrating that combining color
  and depth information substantially improves quality of results.
