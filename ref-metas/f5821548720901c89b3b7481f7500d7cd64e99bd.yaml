paperAbstract: "The multilayer perceptron, when working in auto-association mode,\
  \ is sometimes considered as an interesting candidate to perform data compression\
  \ or dimensionality reduction of the feature space in information processing applications.\
  \ The present paper shows that, for auto-association, the nonlinearities of the\
  \ hidden units are useless and that the optimal parameter values can be derived\
  \ directly by purely linear techniques relying on singular value decomposition and\
  \ low rank matrix approximation, similar in spirit to the well-known Karhunen-Lo\xE8\
  ve transform. This approach appears thus as an efficient alternative to the general\
  \ error back-propagation algorithm commonly used for training multilayer perceptrons.\
  \ Moreover, it also gives a clear interpretation of the r\xF4le of the different\
  \ parameters."
