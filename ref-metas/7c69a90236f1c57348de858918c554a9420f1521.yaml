paperAbstract: 'Semantic vector models have proven their worth in a number of natural
  language applications whose goals can be accomplished by modelling individual semantic
  concepts and measuring similarities between them. By comparison, the area of semantic
  compositionality in these models has so far remained underdeveloped. This will be
  a crucial hurdle for semantic vector models: in order to play a fuller part in the
  modelling of human language, these models will need some way of modelling the way
  in which single concepts are put together to form more complex conceptual structures.
  This paper explores some of the opportunities for using vector product operations
  to model compositional phenomena in natural language. These vector operations are
  all well-known and used in mathematics and physics, particularly in quantum mechanics.
  Instead of designing new vector composition operators, this paper gathers a list
  of existing operators, and a list of typical composition operations in natural language,
  and describes two small experiments that begin to investigate the use of certain
  vector operators to model certain'
