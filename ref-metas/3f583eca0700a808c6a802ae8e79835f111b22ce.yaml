paperAbstract: 'Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields
  (MRFs), represent statistical dependencies of variables by a graph. The max-product
  "belief propagation" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph
  that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore,
  when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most
  probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical
  performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent
  min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding
  of "turbo" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs)
  there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on
  graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on
  a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete-
  or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point
  is a "neighborhood maximum" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability
  of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments
  in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments
  that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no
  more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially
  large. We illustrate the analysis with examples.'
