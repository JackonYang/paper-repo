paperAbstract: "We propose a general framework for parsing images into regions and\
  \ objects. In this framework, the detection and recognition of objects proceed simultaneously\
  \ with image segmentation in a competitive and cooperative manner. We illustrate\
  \ our approach on natural images of complex city scenes where the objects of primary\
  \ interest are faces and text. This method makes use of bottom-up proposals combined\
  \ with top-down generative models using the Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo\
  \ (DDMCMC) algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal estimate asymptotically.\
  \ More precisely, we define generative models for faces, text, and generic regions\u2013\
  \ e.g. shading, texture, and clutter. These models are activated by bottom-up proposals.\
  \ The proposals for faces and text are learnt using a probabilistic version of AdaBoost.\
  \ The DDMCMC combines reversible jump and diffusion dynamics to enable the generative\
  \ models to explain the input images in a competitive and cooperative manner. Our\
  \ experiments illustrate the advantages and importance of combining bottom-up and\
  \ top-down models and of performing segmentation and object detection/recognition\
  \ simultaneously."
