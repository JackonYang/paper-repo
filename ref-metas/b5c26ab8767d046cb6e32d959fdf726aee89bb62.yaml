paperAbstract: "\n \n Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest\
  \ advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the\
  \ Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at\
  \ relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections\
  \ in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art\
  \ performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest\
  \ generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits\
  \ to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear\
  \ empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training\
  \ of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception\
  \ networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual\
  \ connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures\
  \ for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve\
  \ the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task\
  \ significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes\
  \ the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three\
  \ residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test\
  \ set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.\n \n"
