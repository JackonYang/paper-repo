paperAbstract: With the tremendous amount of information that becomes available on
  the Web on a daily basis, the ability to quickly develop information agents has
  become a crucial problem. A vital component of any Web-based information agent is
  a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information
  sources. Our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical
  information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an
  arbitrarily complex document into a series of easier extraction tasks. We introduce
  an inductive algorithm, STALKER, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based
  on user-labeled training examples. Labeling the training data represents the major
  bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results show
  that STALKER does significantly better then other approaches; on one hand, STALKER
  requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms, while
  on the other hand it can handle information sources that could not be wrapped by
  existing techniques.
