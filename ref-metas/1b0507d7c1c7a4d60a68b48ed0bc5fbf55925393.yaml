paperAbstract: Text detection and tracking in scene videos are important prerequisites
  for content-based video analysis and retrieval, wearable camera systems and mobile
  devices augmented reality translators. Here, we present a novel multi-strategy tracking
  based text detection approach in scene videos. In this approach, a state-of-the-art
  scene text detection module [1] is first used to detect text in each video frame.
  Then a multi-strategy text tracking technique is proposed, which uses tracking by
  detection, spatio-temporal context learning, and linear prediction to predict the
  candidate text location sequentially, and adaptively integrates and selects the
  best matching text block from the candidate blocks with a rule-based method. This
  multi-strategy tracking technique can combine the advantages of the three different
  tracking techniques and afterwards make remedies to the disadvantages of them. Experiments
  on a variety of scene videos show that our proposed approach is effective and robust
  to reduce false alarm and improve the accuracy of detection.
