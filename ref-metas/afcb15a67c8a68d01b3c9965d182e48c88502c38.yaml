paperAbstract: We propose a method for recognizing attributes, such as the gender,
  hair style and types of clothes of people under large variation in viewpoint, pose,
  articulation and occlusion typical of personal photo album images. Robust attribute
  classifiers under such conditions must be invariant to pose, but inferring the pose
  in itself is a challenging problem. We use a part-based approach based on poselets.
  Our parts implicitly decompose the aspect (the pose and viewpoint). We train attribute
  classifiers for each such aspect and we combine them together in a discriminative
  model. We propose a new dataset of 8000 people with annotated attributes. Our method
  performs very well on this dataset, significantly outperforming a baseline built
  on the spatial pyramid match kernel method. On gender recognition we outperform
  a commercial face recognition system.
