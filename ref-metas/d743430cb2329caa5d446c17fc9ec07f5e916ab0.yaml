paperAbstract: 'We present a hierarchical model that learns image decompositions via
  alternating layers of convolutional sparse coding and max pooling. When trained
  on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety
  of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and
  complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures
  each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly
  beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible
  to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained
  on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets. When combined with a standard classifier,
  features extracted from these models outperform SIFT, as well as representations
  from other feature learning methods.'
