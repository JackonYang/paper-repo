paperAbstract: 'We address the image denoising problem, where zero-mean white and
  homogeneous Gaussian additive noise is to be removed from a given image. The approach
  taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries.
  Using the K-SVD algorithm, we obtain a dictionary that describes the image content
  effectively. Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself,
  or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited
  in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes
  by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location
  in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective
  denoising algorithm. This leads to a state-of-the-art denoising performance, equivalent
  and sometimes surpassing recently published leading alternative denoising methods'
