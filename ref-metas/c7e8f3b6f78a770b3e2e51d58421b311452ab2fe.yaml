paperAbstract: The construction of word meanings in a discourse context was conceptualized
  as a process of sense activation, sense selection, and sense elaboration. In three
  experiments, subjects read texts presented by a rapid serial visual procedure and
  performed a lexical decision on visually presented targets that followed ambiguous
  prime words. When the target was a word, it was either an associate of the prime
  word, a probable inference suggested by the discourse, or an unrelated word. For
  associates, lexical decisions that related to either the appropriate or the inappropriate
  sense of the ambiguous word were generally facilitated at short (200-400 msec) prime-target
  stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). At longer SOAs, responses were faster to appropriate
  than to inappropriate associates. For the thematic inferences, there was no difference
  between these (appropriate) inferences and (inappropriate) control words at short
  SOAs. At long SOAs (1,000 and 1,500 msec), however, inference words were facilitated.
  The results are interpreted as consistent with a model of lexical processing in
  which sense activation functions independently of context. Discourse context effects,
  whether on sense selection (suppression of inappropriate associates) or on sense
  elaboration (creation of inferences), are seen as postlexical.
