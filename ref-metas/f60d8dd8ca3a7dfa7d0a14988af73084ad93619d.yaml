paperAbstract: In this paper, we explored a learning approach which combines different
  learning methods in inductive logic programming (ILP) to allow a learner to produce
  more expressive hypotheses than that of each individual learner. Such a learning
  approach may be useful when the performance of the task depends on solving a large
  amount of classification problems and each has its own characteristics which may
  or may not fit a particular learning method. The task of semantic parser acquisition
  in two different domains was attempted and preliminary results demonstrated that
  such an approach is promising.
