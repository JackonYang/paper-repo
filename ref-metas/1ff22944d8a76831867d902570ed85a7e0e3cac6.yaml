paperAbstract: We present a computational framework for stereopsis based on the outputs
  of linear spatial filters tuned to a range of orientations and scales. This approach
  goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description
  and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the
  computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented
  for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show
  how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations
  of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise
  smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly
  visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly
  visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are
  incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms,
  artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images.
