paperAbstract: In this paper we introduce a template-based method for recognizing
  human actions called action MACH. Our approach is based on a maximum average correlation
  height (MACH) filter. A common limitation of template-based methods is their inability
  to generate a single template using a collection of examples. MACH is capable of
  capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for
  a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal
  volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the
  frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based
  approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform,
  a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued
  data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method
  with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available
  datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed
  in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.
