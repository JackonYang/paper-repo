paperAbstract: This paper improves recent methods for large scale image search. State-of-the-art
  methods build on the bag-of-features image representation. We, first, analyze bag-of-features
  in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the sub-optimality
  of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more
  precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric
  consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching
  based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent
  in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file
  and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets.
  Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement
  due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well
  as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking
  step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency
  constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy.
