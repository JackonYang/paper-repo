paperAbstract: As language and visual understanding by machines progresses rapidly,
  we are observing an increasing interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink
  both modalities in a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed
  the community to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the
  hope at achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing
  test in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
  that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask how
  we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different algorithms
  on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such challenges as well
  as try to give answers where appropriate options are available in the literature.
  We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented dataset of question-answering
  task based on real-world indoor images that establishes a visual turing challenge.
  Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth annotation, we likely
  have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather rely on 'social consensus'
  as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks. Providing coverage in this
  inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging challenge that we face in order
  to make quantifiable progress in this area.
