paperAbstract: The problem of assigning a probability to each word of a language is
  considered. Two methods are discussed. One method assigns a probability to a word
  on the basis of particular measurable features of the language. The second method
  is applied to languages L(G) generated by a grammar G. A probability is associated
  with each production of G. These in turn define the word probabilities of each word
  in the language. The conditions for this assignment to be a probabilistic measure
  are derived.
