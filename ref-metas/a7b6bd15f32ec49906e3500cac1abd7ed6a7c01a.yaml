paperAbstract: 'The objective of this paper is to estimate 2D human pose as a spatial
  configuration of body parts in TV and movie video shots. Such video material is
  uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively
  reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose
  estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector
  using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and
  (ii) employing ''grabcut'' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak
  model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated
  spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual
  frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and
  self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving
  in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or
  to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation
  over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer,
  and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset.'
