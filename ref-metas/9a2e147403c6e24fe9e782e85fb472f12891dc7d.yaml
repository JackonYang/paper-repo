paperAbstract: The cTDaR competition aims at benchmarking state-of-the-art table detection
  (TRACK A) and table recognition (TRACK B) methods. In particular, we wish to investigate
  and compare general methods that can reliably and robustly identify the table regions
  within a document image on the one hand, and the table structure on the other hand.
  Due to the presence of hand-drawn tables and handwritten text, the methods must
  be robust against various noise conditions, interfering annotations, and variations
  of the tables. Two new challenging datasets were created to test the behaviour of
  state-of-the-art table detection and recognition systems on real world data. One
  dataset consists of modern documents, while the other consists of archival documents
  with presence of hand-drawn tables and handwritten text. The evaluation scheme is
  adapted from the ICDAR 2013 Table competition. We received results of Track A from
  11 teams and results of Track B from 2 teams. Results for Track A are very good
  for the top participants. The winner and his runner-up are very close while using
  very different approaches. Track B was more challenging and only one participant
  was able to produce good results.
