paperAbstract: Appreciation of the form of the retinal image depends upon a correspondence
  between the distribution of light on the retina and the distribution of activity
  among the fibers of the optic nerve. This correspondence may be studied directly
  by recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers in response to illuminating
  various parts of the retina. A given optic nerve fiber responds to light only if
  a particular region of the retina receives illumination. This region is termed the
  receptive field of that fiber. In a previous paper describing the responses in single
  optic nerve fibers from the cold-blooded vertebrate eye (Hartline, 1938) it was
  noted that the receptive fields of the optic nerve fibers are of small but appreciable
  extent, and that their locations on the retina are fixed. It is the purpose of the
  present paper to describe further the characteristics of receptive fields, and to
  discuss some of the spatial factors involved in the excitation of the fibers of
  the optic nerve. METHOD. The method for recording the activity in single optic nerve
  fibers from the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates has been described in the previous
  paper (lot. cit.). An eye is excised, cut open, and small bundles of optic nerve
  fibers are dissected from the anterior surface of the exposed retina. The action
  potentials in these bundles are amplified and recorded with an oscillograph. When
  such a bundle has been split successfully , until only a single active fiber remains,
  the retina must be searched with a small spot of light to determine the region supplying
  that fiber. This search is aided by noting the direction, on the retina, from which
  the nerve fibers in the small bundle come, and by using large spots of light at
  first to locate the approximate position of the sensitive region. The optical system
  employed in these experiments has likewise been described. A spot of light of suitable
  size is projected upon the exposed retina; the coordinates of its position, referred
  to an arbitrary point of origin on the retina, are obtained from readings of crossed
  micrometers which control its location. The micrometer readings are reduced to millimeters
  on the retina by multiplying them by the magnification of the optical system (0.32
  or 0.15). Sharpness of focus of the spot on the retina 690
