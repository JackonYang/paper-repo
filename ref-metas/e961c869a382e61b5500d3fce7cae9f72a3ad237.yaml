paperAbstract: Integration of several vision modules is likely to be one of the keys
  to the power and robustness of the human visual system. We suggest that integration
  is best performed at the location of discontinuities in early processes, such as
  discontinuities in image brightness, depth, motion, texture, and color. Coupled
  Markov Random Field models can be used to combine vision modalities with their discontinuities.
  We derive a scheme to integrate intensity edges with stereo depth and motion field
  information and show results from a Connection Machine algorithm on synthetic and
  natural images. The use of intensity edges to integrate other visual cues and to
  help discover discontinuities emerges as a general and powerful principle.
