paperAbstract: Entry level categories - the labels people will use to name an object
  - were originally defined and studied by psychologists in the 1980s. In this paper
  we study entry-level categories at a large scale and learn the first models for
  predicting entry-level categories for images. Our models combine visual recognition
  predictions with proxies for word "naturalness" mined from the enormous amounts
  of text on the web. We demonstrate the usefulness of our models for predicting nouns
  (entry-level words) associated with images by people. We also learn mappings between
  concepts predicted by existing visual recognition systems and entry-level concepts
  that could be useful for improving human-focused applications such as natural language
  image description or retrieval.
