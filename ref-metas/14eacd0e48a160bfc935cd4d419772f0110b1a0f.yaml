paperAbstract: We develop an algorithm for finding and kinematically tracking multiple
  people in long sequences. Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain
  canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball
  or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and
  localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from
  a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that
  discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames.
  We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting
  figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run
  our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology
  for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences
  including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various
  sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track
  multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions.
