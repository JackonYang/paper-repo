paperAbstract: Motivated by the problem of learning to detect and recognize objects
  with minimal supervision, we develop a hierarchical probabilistic model for the
  spatial structure of visual scenes. In contrast with most existing models, our approach
  explicitly captures uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a
  given image. Our scene model is based on the transformed Dirichlet process (TDP),
  a novel extension of the hierarchical DP in which a set of stochastically transformed
  mixture components are shared between multiple groups of data. For visual scenes,
  mixture components describe the spatial structure of visual features in an object-centered
  coordinate frame, while transformations model the object positions in a particular
  image. Learning and inference in the TDP, which has many potential applications
  beyond computer vision, is based on an empirically effective Gibbs sampler. Applied
  to a dataset of partially labeled street scenes, we show that the TDP's inclusion
  of spatial structure improves detection performance, flexibly exploiting partially
  labeled training images.
