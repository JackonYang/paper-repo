paperAbstract: Tree-structured probabilistic models admit simple, fast inference.
  However they are not well suited to phenonena such as occlusion, where multiple
  components of an object may disappear simultaneously. We address this problem with
  mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this
  mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method
  to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities.
  Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference
  methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that
  employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a)
  uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a
  variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic.
