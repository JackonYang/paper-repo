paperAbstract: 'Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious
  phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters
  and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular
  dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks.
  Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of
  the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper
  we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each
  layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results.
  Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization
  of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on
  the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to
  splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example
  network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may
  dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle,
  or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases
  as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring
  features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final
  surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from
  almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even
  after fine-tuning to the target dataset.'
