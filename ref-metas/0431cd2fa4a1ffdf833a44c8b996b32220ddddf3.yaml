paperAbstract: Averintsev [1] and Spitzer [2] proved that the class of Markov fields
  is identical to the class of Gibbs ensembles when the domain is a finite subset
  of the cubic lattice and each site may be in either of two given states. Hammersley
  and Clifford [3] proved the same result for the more general case when the domain
  is the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and the number of possible states
  for each site is finite. In order to show this, they extended the notion of a Gibbs
  ensemble to embrace more complex interactions than occur on the cubic lattice. Their
  method was circuitous and showed merely the existence of a potential function for
  a Markov field with little indication of its form. In [4], Preston gives a more
  direct approach to the two-state problem and presents an explicit formula for the
  potential. We show here that the equivalence of Markov fields and Gibbs ensembles
  follows immediately from a very simple application of the Mobius inversion theorem
  of [5] which allows us to construct a natural expression for the potential function
  of a Markov field. We confine our attention to the set of sites of an arbitrary
  finite graph and allow each site to be in any one of a countable set of states.
  The two-state solution of Preston emerges as a corollary.
