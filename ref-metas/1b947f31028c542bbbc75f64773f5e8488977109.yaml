paperAbstract: "Automatically summarizing vast amounts of on-line quantitative data\
  \ with a short natural language paragraph has a wide range of real-world applications.\
  \ However, this specific task raises a number of difficult issues that are quite\
  \ distinct from the generic task of language generation: conciseness, complex sentences,\
  \ floating concepts, historical background, paraphrasing power and implicit content.\
  \ \nIn this thesis, I address these specific issues by proposing a new generation\
  \ model in which a first pass builds a draft containing only the essential new facts\
  \ to report and a second pass incrementally revises this draft to opportunistically\
  \ add as many background facts as can fit within the space limit. This model requires\
  \ a new type of linguistic knowledge: revision operations, which specifies the various\
  \ ways a draft can be transformed in order to concisely accommodate a new piece\
  \ of information. I present an in-depth corpus analysis of human-written sports\
  \ summaries that resulted in an extensive set of such revision operations. I also\
  \ present the implementation, based on functional unification grammars, of the system\
  \ scSTREAK, which relies on these operations to incrementally generate complex sentences\
  \ summarizing basketball games. This thesis also contains two quantitative evaluations.\
  \ The first shows that the new revision-based generation model is far more robust\
  \ than the one-pass model of previous generators. The second evaluation demonstrates\
  \ that the revision operations acquired during the corpus analysis and implemented\
  \ in scSTREAK are, for the most part, portable to at least one other quantitative\
  \ domain (the stock market). \nscSTREAK is the first report generator that systematically\
  \ places the facts which it summarizes in their historical perspective. It is more\
  \ concise than previous systems thanks to its ability to generate more complex sentences\
  \ and to opportunistically convey facts by adding a few words to carefully chosen\
  \ draft constituents. The revision operations on which scSTREAK is based constitute\
  \ the first set of corpus-based linguistic knowledge geared towards incremental\
  \ generation. The evaluation presented in this thesis is also the first attempt\
  \ to quantitatively assess the robustness of a new generation model and the portability\
  \ of a new type of linguistic knowledge."
