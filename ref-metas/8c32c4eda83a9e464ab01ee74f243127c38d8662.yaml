paperAbstract: 'We discuss the relations between maximum-entropy (MAXENT) and other
  methods of spectral analysis such as the Schuster, Blackman-Tukey, maximum-likelihood,
  Bayesian, and Autoregressive (AR, ARMA, or ARIMA) models, emphasizing that they
  are not in conflict, but rather are appropriate in different problems. We conclude
  that: 1) "Orthodox" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have
  a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable
  prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in
  problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3)
  The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed
  in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in
  one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in
  all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such
  as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in
  the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient
  to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation,
  windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative
  model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally.'
