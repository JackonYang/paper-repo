paperAbstract: This paper presents a general trainable framework for object detection
  in static images of cluttered scenes. The detection technique we develop is based
  on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis
  of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete
  dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an
  object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This
  representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a
  low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities
  of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly.
  The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which,
  in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous
  approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted)
  models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension
  to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The
  results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general.
