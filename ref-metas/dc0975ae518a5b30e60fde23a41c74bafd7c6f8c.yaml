paperAbstract: 'Variants of Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are
  often used as baseline methods for text classification, but their performance varies
  greatly depending on the model variant, features used and task/dataset. We show
  that: (i) the inclusion of word bigram features gives consistent gains on sentiment
  analysis tasks; (ii) for short snippet sentiment tasks, NB actually does better
  than SVMs (while for longer documents the opposite result holds); (iii) a simple
  but novel SVM variant using NB log-count ratios as feature values consistently performs
  well across tasks and datasets. Based on these observations, we identify simple
  NB and SVM variants which outperform most published results on sentiment analysis
  datasets, sometimes providing a new state-of-the-art performance level.'
