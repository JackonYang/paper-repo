paperAbstract: "Throughout the 1960s I worked on combinatorial optimization problems\
  \ including logic circuit design with Paul Roth and assembly line balancing and\
  \ the traveling salesman problem with Mike Held. These experiences made me aware\
  \ that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial\
  \ explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other\
  \ pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant\
  \ and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds\u2019 papers\
  \ and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction\
  \ between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced\
  \ by Jack\u2019s emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of\
  \ optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook\u2019s definition of the complexity\
  \ class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig\u2019s suggestion that integer\
  \ programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems."
