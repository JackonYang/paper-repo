paperAbstract: "Using block spin assignments, we construct anL2-orthonormal basis\
  \ consisting of dyadic scalings and translates of just a finite number of functions.\
  \ These functions have exponential localization, and for even values of a construction\
  \ parameterM one can make them classCM\u22121 with vanishing moments up to orderM\
  \ inclusive. Such a basis has an important application to phase cell cluster expansions\
  \ in quantum field theory."
