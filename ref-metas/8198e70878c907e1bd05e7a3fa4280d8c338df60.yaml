paperAbstract: We introduce a semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM) method.
  Given a training set of labeled data and a working set of unlabeled data, S3VM constructs
  a support vector machine using both the training and working sets. We use S3VM to
  solve the transduction problem using overall risk minimization (ORM) posed by Vapnik.
  The transduction problem is to estimate the value of a classification function at
  the given points in the working set. This contrasts with the standard inductive
  learning problem of estimating the classification function at all possible values
  and then using the fixed function to deduce the classes of the working set data.
  We propose a general S3VM model that minimizes both the misclassification error
  and the function capacity based on all the available data. We show how the S3VM
  model for 1-norm linear support vector machines can be converted to a mixed-integer
  program and then solved exactly using integer programming. Results of S3VM and the
  standard 1-norm support vector machine approach are compared on ten data sets. Our
  computational results support the statistical learning theory results showing that
  incorporating working data improves generalization when insufficient training information
  is available. In every case, S3VM either improved or showed no significant difference
  in generalization compared to the traditional approach.
