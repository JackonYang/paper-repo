paperAbstract: Despite successes, there are still significant limitations to speech
  recognition performance, particularly for conversational speech and/or for speech
  with significant acoustic degradations from noise or reverberation. For this reason,
  authors have proposed methods that incorporate different (and larger) analysis windows,
  which are described in this article. Note in passing that we and many others have
  already taken advantage of processing techniques that incorporate information over
  long time ranges, for instance for normalization (by cepstral mean subtraction as
  stated in B. Atal (1974) or relative spectral analysis (RASTA) based in H. Hermansky
  and N. Morgan (1994)). They also have proposed features that are based on speech
  sound class posterior probabilities, which have good properties for both classification
  and stream combination.
