paperAbstract: "Energy minimization is an elegant approach to computer vision. Vision\
  \ problems usually have many solutions due to uncertainties in the imaging process\
  \ and ambiguities in visual interpretation. The energy function encodes the problem\
  \ constraints, and its minimum gives the optimal solution. Despite numerous advantages,\
  \ this approach is severely limited by the high computational cost. \nThe main contribution\
  \ of my thesis lies in developing efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms\
  \ for several important classes of energy functions which incorporate everywhere\
  \ smooth, piecewise constant, and piecewise smooth priors. These priors assume,\
  \ respectively, that the quantity to be estimated varies smoothly over its domain,\
  \ consist of several pieces with constant values, or consist of several pieces with\
  \ smoothly varying values. The algorithms rely on graph cuts as a powerful optimization\
  \ technique. \nFor a certain everywhere smooth prior we develop an algorithm which\
  \ finds the exact minimum by computing a single graph cut. This method is most suitable\
  \ to estimate quantities without discontinuities. But even when discontinuities\
  \ exist, the method produces good results in certain cases. The running time is\
  \ low order polynomial. \nFor several wide classes of piecewise smooth priors we\
  \ develop two approximation algorithms (we show that exact minimization in NP-hard\
  \ in these cases). These algorithms produce a local minimum in interesting large\
  \ move spaces. Furthermore, one of them finds a solution within a known factor from\
  \ the optimum. The algorithms are iterative and compute several graph cuts at each\
  \ iteration. The running time at each iteration is effectively linear due to the\
  \ special graph structure. In practice it takes just a few iterations to converge.\
  \ Moreover most of the progress happens during the first iteration. \nFor a certain\
  \ piecewise constant prior we adapt the algorithms developed for the piecewise smooth\
  \ prior. One of them finds a solution within a factor of two from the optimum. In\
  \ addition we develop a third algorithm which finds a local minimum in yet another\
  \ move space. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration,\
  \ stereo, and motion. For the data with ground truth, our methods significantly\
  \ outperform standard methods."
