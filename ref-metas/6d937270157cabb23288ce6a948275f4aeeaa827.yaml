paperAbstract: Many real-world texts contain tables. In order to process these texts
  correctly and extract the information contained within the tables, it is important
  to identify the presence and structure of tables. In this paper, we present a new
  approach that learns to recognize tables in free text, including the boundary, rows
  and columns of tables. When tested on Wall Street Journal news documents, our learning
  approach outperforms a deterministic table recognition algorithm that identifies
  table recognition algorithm that identifies tables based on a fixed set of conditions.
  Our learning approach is also more flexible and easily adaptable to texts in different
  domains with different table characteristics.
