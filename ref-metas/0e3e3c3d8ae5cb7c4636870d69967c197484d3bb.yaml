paperAbstract: This paper will focus on the semantic representation of verbs in computer
  systems and its impact on lexical selection problems in machine translation (MT).
  Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection
  must be based on interpretation of the sentences as well as selection restrictions
  placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is
  compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT.
  We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT),
  and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples
  and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can
  achieve correct lexical selection.
