paperAbstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been recently proposed as a new
  technique for pattern recognition. Intuitively, given a set of points which belong
  to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest
  possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing
  the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by
  a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number
  of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D
  object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images
  of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction
  and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension
  without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed
  experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition.
