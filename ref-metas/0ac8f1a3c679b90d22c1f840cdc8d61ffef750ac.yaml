paperAbstract: Visual question answering is fundamentally compositional in nature---a
  question like "where is the dog?" shares substructure with questions like "what
  color is the dog?" and "where is the cat?" This paper seeks to simultaneously exploit
  the representational capacity of deep networks and the compositional linguistic
  structure of questions. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning *neural
  module networks*, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural "modules"
  into deep networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into
  their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate
  modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors,
  etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach
  on two challenging datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art
  results on both the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions
  about abstract shapes.
