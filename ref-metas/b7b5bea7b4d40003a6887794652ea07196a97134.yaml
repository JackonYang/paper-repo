paperAbstract: We present a new learning algorithm for Mean Field Boltzmann Machines
  based on the contrastive divergence optimization criterion. In addition to minimizing
  the divergence between the data distribution and the equilibrium distribution, we
  maximize the divergence between one-step reconstructions of the data and the equilibrium
  distribution. This eliminates the need to estimate equilibrium statistics, so we
  do not need to approximate the multimodal probability distribution of the free network
  with the unimodal mean field distribution. We test the learning algorithm on the
  classification of digits.
