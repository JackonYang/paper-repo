paperAbstract: FOIL is a learning system that constructs Horn clause programs from
  examples. This paper summarises the development of FOIL from 1989 up to early 1993
  and evaluates its effectiveness on a non-trivial sequence of learning tasks taken
  from a Prolog programming text. Although many of these tasks are handled reasonably
  well, the experiment highlights some weaknesses of the current implementation. Areas
  for further research are identified.
