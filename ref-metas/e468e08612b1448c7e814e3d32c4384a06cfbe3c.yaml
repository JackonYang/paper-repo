paperAbstract: A texture segmentation algorithm inspired by the multichannel filtering
  theory for visual information processing in the early stages of the human visual
  system is presented. The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that
  nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection
  scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed.
  Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a
  nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each
  pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate
  the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate
  spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments
  on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second
  and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted
  by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>
