paperAbstract: This correspondence describes a method of dividing a picture into differently
  textured regions by thresholding the values of a suitable local picture property.
  The approach used is a generalization to natural textures of a technique recently
  proposed by Tsuji. The examples given involve textures that differ in coarseness;
  a method of estimating texture coarseness by analysis of local property values is
  also described.
