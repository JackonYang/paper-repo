paperAbstract: 'MOTIVATION

  Predicting the secondary structure of a protein (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, coil)
  is an important step towards elucidating its three-dimensional structure, as well
  as its function. Presently, the best predictors are based on machine learning approaches,
  in particular neural network architectures with a fixed, and relatively short, input
  window of amino acids, centered at the prediction site. Although a fixed small window
  avoids overfitting problems, it does not permit capturing variable long-rang information.



  RESULTS

  We introduce a family of novel architectures which can learn to make predictions
  based on variable ranges of dependencies. These architectures extend recurrent neural
  networks, introducing non-causal bidirectional dynamics to capture both upstream
  and downstream information. The prediction algorithm is completed by the use of
  mixtures of estimators that leverage evolutionary information, expressed in terms
  of multiple alignments, both at the input and output levels. While our system currently
  achieves an overall performance close to 76% correct prediction--at least comparable
  to the best existing systems--the main emphasis here is on the development of new
  algorithmic ideas.



  AVAILABILITY

  The executable program for predicting protein secondary structure is available from
  the authors free of charge.
