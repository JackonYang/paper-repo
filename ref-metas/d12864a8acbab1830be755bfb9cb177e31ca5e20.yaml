paperAbstract: Handwriting has continued to persist as a means of communication and
  recording information in day-to-day life even with the introduction of new technologies.
  Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has
  practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses
  on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This
  overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into
  electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms.
  Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during
  writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered.
  Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with
  practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification,
  writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered.
