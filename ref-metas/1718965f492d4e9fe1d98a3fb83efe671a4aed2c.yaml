paperAbstract: When a vision system creates an interpretation of some input datn,
  it assigns truth values or probabilities to intcrnal hypothcses about the world.
  We present a non-dctcrministic method for assigning truth values that avoids many
  of the problcms encountered by existing relaxation methods. Instead of rcprcscnting
  probabilitics with realnumbers, we usc a more dircct encoding in which thc probability
  \ associated with a hypotlmis is rcprcscntcd by the probability hat it is in one
  of two states, true or false. Wc give a particular nondeterministic operator, based
  on statistical mechanics, for updating the truth values of hypothcses. The operator
  ensures that the probability of discovering a particular combination of hypothcscs
  is a simplc function of how good that combination is. Wc show that thcrc is a simple
  relationship bctween this operator and Bayesian inference, and we describe a learning
  rule which allows a parallel system to converge on a set ofweights that optimizes
  its perccptt~al inferences.
