paperAbstract: Most computer vision systems use one-dimensional operators to calculate
  the curvature of boundaries or image contours. However, the more sophisticated biological
  systems use two-dimensional operators. Here we analyze how curvature can be computed
  by using two-dimensional operators and show the relation of this approach to the
  one-dimensional methods currently in use.
