paperAbstract: Tree structured models have been widely used for determining the pose
  of a human body, from either 2D or 3D data. While such models can effectively represent
  the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure, they do not capture additional
  constraints such as coordination of the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss
  an important source of information about human body pose, as limb coordination is
  necessary for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being evident
  in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this paper, we consider the
  use of undirected graphical models that augment a tree structure with latent variables
  in order to account for coordination between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor
  models, since they are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional
  correlations in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree structure.
  These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure and thus a variant
  of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can be applied for efficient estimation.
  We present some experimental results contrasting common-factor models with tree
  models, and quantify the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data.
