paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase.
  Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to
  obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in
  this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for
  a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping
  from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second,
  we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring
  predicates. On the dataset of Cai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated
  logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally,
  we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and
  improves over a natural baseline.'
