paperAbstract: We analyze some of the fundamental design challenges and misconceptions
  that underlie the development of an efficient and robust NER system. In particular,
  we address issues such as the representation of text chunks, the inference approach
  needed to combine local NER decisions, the sources of prior knowledge and how to
  use them within an NER system. In the process of comparing several solutions to
  these challenges we reach some surprising conclusions, as well as develop an NER
  system that achieves 90.8 F1 score on the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task, the best reported
  result for this dataset.
