paperAbstract: Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have been widely explored
  as text representation techniques for text retrieval. In this paper we study the
  properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization
  task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation
  issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion
  of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature
  set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for
  word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering
  method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations. An improved
  probabilistic text categorization method is also presented.
