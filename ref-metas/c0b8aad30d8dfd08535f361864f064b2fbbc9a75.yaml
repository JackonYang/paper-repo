paperAbstract: 'In this work we present a framework for the recognition of natural
  scene text. Our framework does not require any human-labelled data, and performs
  word recognition on the whole image holistically, departing from the character based
  recognition systems of the past. The deep neural network models at the centre of
  this framework are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation
  engine -- synthetic data that is highly realistic and sufficient to replace real
  data, giving us infinite amounts of training data. This excess of data exposes new
  possibilities for word recognition models, and here we consider three models, each
  one "reading" words in a different way: via 90k-way dictionary encoding, character
  sequence encoding, and bag-of-N-grams encoding. In the scenarios of language based
  and completely unconstrained text recognition we greatly improve upon state-of-the-art
  performance on standard datasets, using our fast, simple machinery and requiring
  zero data-acquisition costs.'
