paperAbstract: 1. The response properties of single cells in monkey striate cortex
  were examined using moving bars, square-wave gratings, and sine-wave gratings. 2.
  The moving of cells studied were not selective for bar width or for the spatial
  frequency of square-wave gratings. 3. Most cells responded selectively to the spatial
  frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating
  eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the
  receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The
  sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type
  cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in
  the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge
  in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells
  discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify
  cells as S or CS type.
