paperAbstract: Previous deep learning based state-of-the-art scene text detection
  methods can be roughly classified into two categories. The first category treats
  scene text as a type of general objects and follows general object detection paradigm
  to localize scene text by regressing the text box locations, but troubled by the
  arbitrary-orientation and large aspect ratios of scene text. The second one segments
  text regions directly, but mostly needs complex post processing. In this paper,
  we present a method that combines the ideas of the two types of methods while avoiding
  their shortcomings. We propose to detect scene text by localizing corner points
  of text bounding boxes and segmenting text regions in relative positions. In inference
  stage, candidate boxes are generated by sampling and grouping corner points, which
  are further scored by segmentation maps and suppressed by NMS. Compared with previous
  methods, our method can handle long oriented text naturally and doesn't need complex
  post processing. The experiments on ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, MLT and COCO-Text
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better or comparable results in
  both accuracy and efficiency. Based on VGG16, it achieves an F-measure of 84.3%
  on ICDAR2015 and 81.5% on MSRA-TD500.
