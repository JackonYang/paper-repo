paperAbstract: We introduce a new distance between two distributions that we call
  the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which reflects the minimal amount of work that
  must be performed to transform one distribution into the other by moving "distribution
  mass" around. This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization,
  for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching.
  When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a
  true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications
  to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the
  structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional
  Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating
  through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database
  search.
