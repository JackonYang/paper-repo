paperAbstract: 'A central goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint
  probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically
  difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model
  will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during
  training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization
  by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose
  to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for
  words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential
  number of semantically neighboring sentences. Generalization is obtained because
  a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it
  is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation)
  to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions
  of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report
  on several methods to speed-up both training and probability computation, as well
  as comparative experiments to evaluate the improvements brought by these techniques.
  We finally describe the incorporation of this new language model into a state-of-the-art
  speech recognizer of conversational speech.'
