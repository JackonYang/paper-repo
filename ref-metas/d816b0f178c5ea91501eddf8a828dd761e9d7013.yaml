paperAbstract: A novel approach to automatic classification of digitized office documents
  based on the inductive generalization of their layout style, is presented. It is
  supported by the observation that for a number of printed documents it is possible
  to find a set of relevant and invariant layout features. These are geometrical characteristics
  automatically detected through a segmentation and layout analysis process. The learning
  step, in which significant examples of document classes are used to train the classification
  system, involves the novel idea of integrating parametric (numerical) and conceptual
  (symbolic) learning methods.<<ETX>>
