paperAbstract: Computer vision is embracing a new research focus in which the aim
  is to develop visual skills for robots that allow them to interact with a dynamic,
  realistic environment. To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need
  to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental
  goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully
  used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored
  objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models.
  It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence
  of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large
  number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique
  calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast
  incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into
  a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces
  an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently
  in crowded scenes.
