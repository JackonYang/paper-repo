paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we report a breakthrough result on the difficult task
  of segmentation and recognition of coloured text from the word image dataset of
  ICDAR robust reading competition challenge 2: reading text in scene images. We split
  the word image into individual colour, gray and lightness planes and enhance the
  contrast of each of these planes independently by a power-law transform. The discrimination
  factor of each plane is computed as the maximum between-class variance used in Otsu
  thresholding. The plane that has maximum discrimination factor is selected for segmentation.
  The trial version of Omnipage OCR is then used on the binarized words for recognition.
  Our recognition results on ICDAR 2011 and ICDAR 2003 word datasets are compared
  with those reported in the literature. As baseline, the images binarized by simple
  global and local thresholding techniques were also recognized. The word recognition
  rate obtained by our non-linear enhancement and selection of plance method is 72.8%
  and 66.2% for ICDAR 2011 and 2003 word datasets, respectively. We have created ground-truth
  for each image at the pixel level to benchmark these datasets using a toolkit developed
  by us. The recognition rate of benchmarked images is 86.7% and 83.9% for ICDAR 2011
  and 2003 datasets, respectively.'
