paperAbstract: "Introduction The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LOTH) is a concept\
  \ in cognitive science which describes mental activity in the brain as a form of\
  \ language. The hypothesis was developed by Jerry Fodor in his book [1]. It states\
  \ that the mind works with a language that is similar to regular languages, where\
  \ an array of \u201Cwords\u201D together with syntactic and semantic rules make\
  \ up the meaning of sentences and that these constructs are processed much like\
  \ in a computer[2]. The origins for this hypothesis are older than Fodor\u2019s\
  \ book however. Leibnitz already postulated the existence of an interpretable language\
  \ of thought, which he called lingua mentis [3]."
