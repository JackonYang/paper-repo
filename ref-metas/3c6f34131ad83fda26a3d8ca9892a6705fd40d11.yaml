paperAbstract: "1. A detailed theory of cerebellar cortex is proposed whose consequence\
  \ is that the cerebellum learns to perform motor skills. Two forms of input\u2014\
  output relation are described, both consistent with the cortical theory. One is\
  \ suitable for learning movements (actions), and the other for learning to maintain\
  \ posture and balance (maintenance reflexes)."
