paperAbstract: In this paper we present an unsupervised neural network which exhibits
  competition between units via inhibitory feedback. The operation is such as to minimize
  reconstruction error, both for individual patterns, and over the entire training
  set. A key difference from networks which perform principal components analysis,
  or one of its variants, is the ability to converge to non-orthogonal weight values.
  We discuss the network's operation in relation to the twin goals of maximizing information
  transfer and minimizing code entropy, and show how the assignment of prior probabilities
  to network outputs can help to reduce entropy. We present results from two binary
  coding problems, and from experiments with image coding.
