paperAbstract: "We study the problem of object classification when training and test\
  \ classes are disjoint, i.e. no training examples of the target classes are available.\
  \ This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the\
  \ rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of\
  \ different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have\
  \ been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle\
  \ the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object\
  \ detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects\
  \ instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes,\
  \ like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend\
  \ the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets\
  \ unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on\
  \ their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In\
  \ order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have\
  \ assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201CAnimals with Attributes\u201D, of over\
  \ 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of\
  \ how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our\
  \ experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build\
  \ a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of\
  \ the target classes."
