paperAbstract: We present a novel commentator system that learns language from sportscasts
  of simulated soccer games. The system learns to parse and generate commentaries
  without any engineered knowledge about the English language. Training is done using
  only ambiguous supervision in the form of textual human commentaries and simulation
  states of the soccer games. The system simultaneously tries to establish correspondences
  between the commentaries and the simulation states as well as build a translation
  model. We also present a novel algorithm, Iterative Generation Strategy Learning
  (IGSL), for deciding which events to comment on. Human evaluations of the generated
  commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality compared to human commentaries.
