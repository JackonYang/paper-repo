paperAbstract: 'This paper compares two methods for object localization from contours:
  shape context and chamfer matching of templates. In the light of our experiments,
  we suggest improvements to the shape context: shape contexts are used to find corresponding
  features between model and image. In real images it is shown that the shape context
  is highly influenced by clutters; furthermore, even when the object is correctly
  localized, the feature correspondence may be poor. We show that the robustness of
  shape matching can be increased by including a figural continuity constraint. The
  combined shape and continuity cost is minimized using the Viterbi algorithm on features,
  resulting in improved localization and correspondence. Our algorithm can be generally
  applied to any feature based shape matching method. Chamfer matching correlates
  model templates with the distance transform of the edge image. This can be done
  efficiently using a coarse-to-fine search over the transformation parameters. The
  method is robust in clutter, however, multiple templates are needed to handle scale,
  rotation and shape variation. We compare both methods for locating hand shapes in
  cluttered images, and applied to word recognition in EZ-Gimpy images.'
