paperAbstract: In this paper, we have proposed a novel scheme for the extraction of
  textual areas of an image using globally matched wavelet filters. A clustering-based
  technique has been devised for estimating globally matched wavelet filters using
  a collection of groundtruth images. We have extended our text extraction scheme
  for the segmentation of document images into text, background, and picture components
  (which include graphics and continuous tone images). Multiple, two-class Fisher
  classifiers have been used for this purpose. We also exploit contextual information
  by using a Markov random field formulation-based pixel labeling scheme for refinement
  of the segmentation results. Experimental results have established effectiveness
  of our approach.
