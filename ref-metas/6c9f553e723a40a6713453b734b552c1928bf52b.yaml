paperAbstract: The kinds of tree representations used in a treebank corpus can have
  a dramatic effect on performance of a parser based on the PCFG estimated from that
  corpus, causing the estimated likelihood of a tree to differ substantially from
  its frequency in the training corpus. This paper points out that the Penn II treebank
  representations are of the kind predicted to have such an effect, and describes
  a simple node relabeling transformation that improves a treebank PCFG-based parser's
  average precision and recall by around 8%, or approximately half of the performance
  difference between a simple PCFG model and the best broad-coverage parsers available
  today. This performance variation comes about because any PCFG, and hence the corpus
  of trees from which the PCFG is induced, embodies independence assumptions about
  the distribution of words and phrases. The particular independence assumptions implicit
  in a tree representation can be studied theoretically and investigated empirically
  by means of a tree transformation / detransformation process.
