paperAbstract: We develop a strategy for extracting the underlying relational information
  from the images of printed tables. Visual clues that exist in the image are used
  for extracting first the physical, and then the logical structure of the table.
  Since these visual clues generally have a logical meaning, there must be some association
  made between the graphical attributes extracted and their function of reflecting
  the logic expressed by the table; this knowledge is coordinated in a model. This
  approach, therefore, can be adapted to all tables which have graphical attributes
  discernible to the image analysis being used.
