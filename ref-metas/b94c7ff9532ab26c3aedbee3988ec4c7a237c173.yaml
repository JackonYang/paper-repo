paperAbstract: We propose a novel approach for solving the perceptual grouping problem
  in vision. Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the
  image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We
  treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global
  criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion
  measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the
  total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique
  based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion.
  We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very
  encouraging.
