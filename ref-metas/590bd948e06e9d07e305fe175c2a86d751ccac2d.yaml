paperAbstract: 'An evaluation is made of several neural network classifiers, comparing
  their performance on a typical problem, namely handwritten digit recognition. For
  this purpose, the authors use a database of handwritten digits, with relatively
  uniform handwriting styles. The authors propose a novel way of organizing the network
  architectures by training several small networks so as to deal separately with subsets
  of the problem, and then combining the results. This approach works in conjunction
  with various techniques including: layered networks with one or several layers of
  adaptive connections, fully connected recursive networks, ad hoc networks with no
  adaptive connections, and architectures with second-degree polynomial decision surfaces.<<ETX>>'
