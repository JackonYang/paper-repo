paperAbstract: In this paper we present a new approach to material classification
  under unknown viewpoint and illumination. Our texture model is based on the statistical
  distribution of clustered filter responses. However, unlike previous 3D texton representations,
  we use rotationally invariant filters and cluster in an extremely low dimensional
  space. Having built a texton dictionary, we present a novel method of classifying
  a single image without requiring any a priori knowledge about the viewing or illumination
  conditions under which it was photographed. We argue that using rotationally invariant
  filters while clustering in such a low dimensional space improves classification
  performance and demonstrate this claim with results on all 61 textures in the Columbia-Utrecht
  database. We then proceed to show how texture models can be further extended by
  compensating for viewpoint changes using weak isotropy.The new clustering and classification
  methods are compared to those of Leung and Malik (ICCV 1999), Schmid (CVPR 2001)
  and Cula and Dana (CVPR 2001), which are the current state-of-the-art approaches.
