paperAbstract: We consider the problem of open-domain question answering (Open QA)
  over massive knowledge bases (KBs). Existing approaches use either manually curated
  KBs like Freebase or KBs automatically extracted from unstructured text. In this
  paper, we present OQA, the first approach to leverage both curated and extracted
  KBs. A key technical challenge is designing systems that are robust to the high
  variability in both natural language questions and massive KBs. OQA achieves robustness
  by decomposing the full Open QA problem into smaller sub-problems including question
  paraphrasing and query reformulation. OQA solves these sub-problems by mining millions
  of rules from an unlabeled question corpus and across multiple KBs. OQA then learns
  to integrate these rules by performing discriminative training on question-answer
  pairs using a latent-variable structured perceptron algorithm. We evaluate OQA on
  three benchmark question sets and demonstrate that it achieves up to twice the precision
  and recall of a state-of-the-art Open QA system.
