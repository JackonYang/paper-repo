paperAbstract: 'Scene text reading continues to be of interest for many reasons including
  applications for the visually impaired and automatic image indexing systems. Here
  we propose a novel end-to-end scene text detection algorithm. First, for identifying
  text regions we design a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that
  aggregates local surrounding information for cascaded, fast and accurate detection.
  The local information serves as context and provides rich cues to distinguish text
  from background noises. In addition, we designed a novel grouping algorithm on top
  of detected character graph as well as a text line refinement step. Text line refinement
  consists of a text line extension module, together with a text line filtering and
  regression module. Jointly they produce accurate oriented text line bounding box.
  Experiments show that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in several
  benchmark data sets: ICDAR 2003 (IC03), ICDAR 2013 (IC13) and Street View Text (SVT).'
