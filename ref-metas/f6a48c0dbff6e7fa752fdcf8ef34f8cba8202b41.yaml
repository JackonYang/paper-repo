paperAbstract: There is general consensus that context can be a rich source of information
  about an object's identity, location and scale. However the issue of how to formalize
  centextual influences is still largely open. Here we introduce a simple probabilistic
  framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties. We
  represent global context information in terms of the spatial layout of spectral
  components. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for context driven
  focus of attention and scale-selection on real-world scenes. Based on a simple holistic
  analysis of an image, the scheme is able to accurately predict object locations
  and sizes.
