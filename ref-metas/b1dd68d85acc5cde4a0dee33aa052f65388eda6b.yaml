paperAbstract: Many computer vision problems have an asymmetric distribution of information
  between training and test time. In this work, we study the case where we are given
  additional information about the training data, which however will not be available
  at test time. This situation is called learning using privileged information (LUPI).
  We introduce two maximum-margin techniques that are able to make use of this additional
  source of information, and we show that the framework is applicable to several scenarios
  that have been studied in computer vision before. Experiments with attributes, bounding
  boxes, image tags and rationales as additional information in object classification
  show promising results.
