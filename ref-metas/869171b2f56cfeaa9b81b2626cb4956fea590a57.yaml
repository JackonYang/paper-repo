paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a computational model of the recognition
  of real world scenes that bypasses the segmentation and the processing of individual
  objects or regions. The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation
  of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual
  dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent
  the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may
  be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model
  generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic
  categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The
  performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about
  object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that
  modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic
  category.
