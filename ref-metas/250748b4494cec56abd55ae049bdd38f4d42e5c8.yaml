paperAbstract: A novel graph theoretic approach for data clustering is presented and
  its application to the image segmentation problem is demonstrated. The data to be
  clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities
  assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved
  by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest
  inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately
  2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and
  cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu
  algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems
  for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm
  which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much
  reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained
  by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs
  with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied
  to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching
  for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist
  mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges.
  This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time
  guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >
