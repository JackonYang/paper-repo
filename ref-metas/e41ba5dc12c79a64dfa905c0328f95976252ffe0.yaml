paperAbstract: "Chapter 11 includes more case studies in other areas, ranging from\
  \ manufacturing to marketing research. Chapter 12 concludes the book with some commentary\
  \ about the scienti\x8E c contributions of MTS. The Taguchi method for design of\
  \ experiment has generated considerable controversy in the statistical community\
  \ over the past few decades. The MTS/MTGS method seems to lead another source of\
  \ discussions on the methodology it advocates (Montgomery 2003). As pointed out\
  \ by Woodall et al. (2003), the MTS/MTGS methods are considered ad hoc in the sense\
  \ that they have not been developed using any underlying statistical theory. Because\
  \ the \u201Cnormal\u201D and \u201Cabnormal\u201D groups form the basis of the theory,\
  \ some sampling restrictions are fundamental to the applications. First, it is essential\
  \ that the \u201Cnormal\u201D sample be uniform, unbiased, and/or complete so that\
  \ a reliable measurement scale is obtained. Second, the selection of \u201Cabnormal\u201D\
  \ samples is crucial to the success of dimensionality reduction when OAs are used.\
  \ For example, if each abnormal item is really unique in the medical example, then\
  \ it is unclear how the statistical distance MD can be guaranteed to give a consistent\
  \ diagnosis measure of severity on a continuous scale when the larger-the-better\
  \ type S/N ratio is used. Multivariate diagnosis is not new to Technometrics readers\
  \ and is now becoming increasingly more popular in statistical analysis and data\
  \ mining for knowledge discovery. As a promising alternative that assumes no underlying\
  \ data model, The Mahalanobis\u2013Taguchi Strategy does not provide suf\x8E cient\
  \ evidence of gains achieved by using the proposed method over existing tools. Readers\
  \ may be very interested in a detailed comparison with other diagnostic tools, such\
  \ as logistic regression and tree-based methods. Overall, although the idea of MTS/MTGS\
  \ is intriguing, this book would be more valuable had it been written in a rigorous\
  \ fashion as a technical reference. There is some lack of precision even in several\
  \ mathematical notations. Perhaps a follow-up with additional theoretical justi\x8E\
  \ cation and careful case studies would answer some of the lingering questions."
