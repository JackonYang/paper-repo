paperAbstract: We present a new family of error-correcting codes for the binary symmetric
  channel. These codes are designed to encode a sparse source, and are defined in
  terms of very sparse invertible matrices, in such a way that the decoder can treat
  the signal and the noise symmetrically. The decoding problem involves only very
  sparse matrices and sparse vectors, and so is a promising candidate for practical
  decoding.
