paperAbstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains
  an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends
  on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects.
  But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual
  information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem.
  In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created
  from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages over real
  images. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information,
  since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation
  detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of real images. Importantly, abstract images
  also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding
  analogous sets of real images that are semantically similar would be nearly impossible.
  We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract images with corresponding
  written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically
  important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring
  semantic similarity. Finally, we study the relation between the saliency and memorability
  of objects and their semantic importance.
