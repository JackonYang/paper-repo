paperAbstract: 1. The class to which each thing belongs. 2. The average properties
  of each class. 3. The deviations of each thing from the average properties of its
  parent class. If the things are found to be concentrated in a small area of the
  region of each class in the measurement space then the deviations will be small,
  and with reference to the average class properties most of the information about
  a thing is given by naming the class to which it belongs. In this case the information
  may be recorded much more briefly than if a classification had not been used. We
  suggest that the best classification is that which results in the briefest recording
  of all the attribute information. In this context, we will regard the measurements
  of each thing as being a message about that thing. Shannon (1948) showed that where
  messages may be regarded as each nominating the occurrence of a particular event
  among a universe of possible events, the information needed to record a series of
  such messages is minimised if the messages are encoded so that the length of each
  message is proportional to minus the logarithm of the relative frequency of occurrence
  of the event which it nominates. The information required is greatest when all frequencies
  are equal. The messages here nominate the positions in measurement space of the
  5 1 points representing the attributes of the things. If the expected density of
  points in the measurement space is everywhere uniform, the positions of the points
  cannot be encoded more briefly than by a simple list of the measured values. However,
  if the expected density is markedly non-uniform, application
