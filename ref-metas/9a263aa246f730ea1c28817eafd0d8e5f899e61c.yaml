paperAbstract: The principles of the model-based document analysis system called Pi
  ODA (paper interface to office document architecture), which was developed as a
  prototype for the analysis of single-sided business letters in German, are presented.
  Initially, Pi ODA extracts a part-of hierarchy of nested layout objects such as
  text-blocks, lines, and words based on their presentation on the page. Subsequently,
  in a step called logical labeling, the layout objects and their compositions are
  geometrically analyzed to identify corresponding logical objects that can be related
  to a human perceptible meaning, such as sender, recipient, and date in a letter.
  A context-sensitive text recognition for logical objects is then applied using logical
  vocabularies and syntactic knowledge. As a result, Pi ODA produces a document representation
  that conforms to the ODA international standard.<<ETX>>
