paperAbstract: 'This paper describes a new technique for solv- ing multiclass learning
  problems by combining Freund and Schapire''s boosting algorithm with the main ideas
  of Diet- terich and Bakiri''s method of error-correcting output codes (ECOC). Boosting
  is a general method of improving the ac- curacy of a given base or "weak" learning
  algorithm. ECOC is a robust method of solving multiclass learning problems by reducing
  to a sequence of two-class problems. We show that our new hybrid method has advantages
  of both: Like ECOC, our method only requires that the base learning al- gorithm
  work on binary-labeled data. Like boosting, we prove that the method comes with
  strong theoretical guar- antees on the training and generalization error of the
  final combined hypothesis assuming only that the base learning algorithm perform
  slightly better than random guessing. Although previous methods were known for boosting
  multi- class problems, the new method may be significantly faster and require less
  programming effort in creating the base learning algorithm. We also compare the
  new algorithm experimentally to other voting methods.'
