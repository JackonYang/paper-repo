paperAbstract: In this note we discuss how recognition can be achieved from a single
  2D model view exploiting prior knowledge of an object''s structure (e.g. symmetry).
  We prove that for any bilaterally symmetric 3D object one non- accidental 2D model
  view is sufficient for recognition. Symmetries of higher order allow the recovery
  of structure from one 2D view. Linear transformations can be learned exactly from
  a small set of examples in the case of "linear object classes" and used to produce
  new views of an object from a single view.
