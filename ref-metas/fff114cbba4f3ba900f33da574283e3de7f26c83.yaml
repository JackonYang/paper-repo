paperAbstract: We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations
  of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in
  a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk
  generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning
  (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information
  obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating
  walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations
  on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as
  BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging
  baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence
  of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10%
  higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments,
  DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using
  60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm
  which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These
  qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as
  network classification, and anomaly detection.
