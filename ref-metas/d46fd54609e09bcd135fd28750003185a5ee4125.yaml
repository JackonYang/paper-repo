paperAbstract: "While many models of biological object recognition share a common\
  \ set of \u201Cbroad-stroke\u201D properties, the performance of any one model depends\
  \ strongly on the choice of parameters in a particular instantiation of that model\u2014\
  e.g., the number of units per layer, the size of pooling kernels, exponents in normalization\
  \ operations, etc. Since the number of such parameters (explicit or implicit) is\
  \ typically large and the computational cost of evaluating one particular parameter\
  \ set is high, the space of possible model instantiations goes largely unexplored.\
  \ Thus, when a model fails to approach the abilities of biological visual systems,\
  \ we are left uncertain whether this failure is because we are missing a fundamental\
  \ idea or because the correct \u201Cparts\u201D have not been tuned correctly, assembled\
  \ at sufficient scale, or provided with enough training. Here, we present a high-throughput\
  \ approach to the exploration of such parameter sets, leveraging recent advances\
  \ in stream processing hardware (high-end NVIDIA graphic cards and the PlayStation\
  \ 3's IBM Cell Processor). In analogy to high-throughput screening approaches in\
  \ molecular biology and genetics, we explored thousands of potential network architectures\
  \ and parameter instantiations, screening those that show promising object recognition\
  \ performance for further analysis. We show that this approach can yield significant,\
  \ reproducible gains in performance across an array of basic object recognition\
  \ tasks, consistently outperforming a variety of state-of-the-art purpose-built\
  \ vision systems from the literature. As the scale of available computational power\
  \ continues to expand, we argue that this approach has the potential to greatly\
  \ accelerate progress in both artificial vision and our understanding of the computational\
  \ underpinning of biological vision."
