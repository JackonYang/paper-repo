paperAbstract: 'This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or <italic>k</italic>-d
  tree, where <italic>k</italic> is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data
  structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The
  <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite
  efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure
  is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently.
  Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in
  an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>);
  deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>);
  deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization
  (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic>
  log <italic>n</italic>). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with
  <italic>t</italic> keys specified [proven maximum running time of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>)]
  and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of <italic>O</italic>(log
  <italic>n</italic>).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms
  for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query.
  The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that <italic>k</italic>-d
  trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses
  are given.'
