paperAbstract: In this paper, we present and compare various single-word based alignment
  models for statistical machine translation. We discuss the five IBM alignment models,
  the Hidden-Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques and various modifications.
  We present different methods to combine alignments. As evaluation criterion we use
  the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference
  alignment. We show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model
  lead to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, which
  are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies.
