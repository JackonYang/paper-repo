paperAbstract: 'With contributions from Tomas LozanoPerez and Daniel P. Huttenlocher.An
  intelligent system must know "what "the objects are and "where "they are in its
  environment. Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks
  involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks,
  gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book
  describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical
  area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and
  localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the
  solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The
  solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many
  real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being
  used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved,
  the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and
  limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L. Grimson is Matsushita
