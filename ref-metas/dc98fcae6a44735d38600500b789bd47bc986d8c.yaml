paperAbstract: This talk discussed our object-class recognition method that won the
  classification contest of the Pascal VOC Challenge 2007. We submitted two recognition
  methods sharing the same underlying image representations defined by a choice of
  image sampler, local descriptor and global spatial grid. The submitted methods also
  share the classifier, which is a one-against-rest non-linear Support Vector Machine
  with chi-square kernel. The methods differ in the way they combine multiple representations
  (channels). The first method is based on the approach of Zhang et al., where the
  final similarity measure is the sum of per-channel similarities. The second method
  employs a genetic algorithm, which is used to determine (on per-class basis) the
  parameters of the generalized RBF kernel incorporating all the channels, i.e., to
  estimate the importance of each sampling/description/spatial method for the recognition
  and to optimize the required level of generalization. Both methods showed superior
  performance compared to other state-of-the-art submissions.
