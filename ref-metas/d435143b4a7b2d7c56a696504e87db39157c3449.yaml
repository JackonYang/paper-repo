paperAbstract: "1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate\
  \ cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these\
  \ cells may be considered to sum light\u2010evoked influences linearly across their\
  \ receptive fields. We used one\u2010dimensional luminance\u2010modulated bars and\
  \ grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation\
  \ of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen\
  \ by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled\
  \ a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells\
  \ respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated\
  \ in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial\
  \ summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated\
  \ in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields,\
  \ and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies.\
  \ Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply\
  \ by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the\
  \ grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate\
  \ linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null'\
  \ phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non\u2010linear spatial summation,\
  \ and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses\
  \ of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of\
  \ simple cells appears to have significant non\u2010linearities of spatial summation.\
  \ These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially\
  \ or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when\
  \ tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non\u2010linearity by giving\
  \ responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly\
  \ of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on\u2010off' responses). 4. We compared\
  \ simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different\
  \ spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells'\
  \ receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings\
  \ to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles\
  \ measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived\
  \ by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves."
