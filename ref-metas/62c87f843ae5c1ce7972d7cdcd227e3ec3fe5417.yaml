paperAbstract: Modeling dynamic structure of speech is a novel paradigm in speech
  recognition research within the generative modeling framework, and it offers a potential
  to overcome limitations of the current hidden Markov modeling approach. Analogous
  to structured language models where syntactic structure is exploited to represent
  long-distance relationships among words , the structured speech model described
  in this paper makes use of the dynamic structure in the hidden vocal tract resonance
  space to characterize long-span contextual influence among phonetic units. A general
  overview is provided first on hierarchically classified types of dynamic speech
  models in the literature. A detailed account is then given for a specific model
  type called the hidden trajectory model, and we describe detailed steps of model
  construction and the parameter estimation algorithms. We show how the use of resonance
  target parameters and their temporal filtering enables joint modeling of long-span
  coarticulation and phonetic reduction effects. Experiments on phonetic recognition
  evaluation demonstrate superior recognizer performance over a modern hidden Markov
  model-based system. Error analysis shows that the greatest performance gain occurs
  within the sonorant speech class
