paperAbstract: We present a parametric statistical model for visual images in the
  wavelet transform domain. We characterize the joint densities of coefficient magnitudes
  at adjacent spatial locations, adjacent orientations, and adjacent spatial scales.
  The model accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of visual images. As a demonstration
  of this, we used the model to design a progressive image encoder with state-of-the-art
  rate-distortion performance. We also show promising examples of image restoration
  and texture synthesis.
