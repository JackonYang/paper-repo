paperAbstract: A fast and flexible algorithm for computing watersheds in digital gray-scale
  images is introduced. A review of watersheds and related motion is first presented,
  and the major methods to determine watersheds are discussed. The algorithm is based
  on an immersion process analogy, in which the flooding of the water in the picture
  is efficiently simulated using of queue of pixel. It is described in detail provided
  in a pseudo C language. The accuracy of this algorithm is proven to be superior
  to that of the existing implementations, and it is shown that its adaptation to
  any kind of digital grid and its generalization to n-dimensional images (and even
  to graphs) are straightforward. The algorithm is reported to be faster than any
  other watershed algorithm. Applications of this algorithm with regard to picture
  segmentation are presented for magnetic resonance (MR) imagery and for digital elevation
  models. An example of 3-D watershed is also provided. >
