paperAbstract: Two linear time (and hence asymptotically optimal) algorithms for computing
  the Euclidean distance transform of a two-dimensional binary image are presented.
  The algorithms are based on the construction and regular sampling of the Voronoi
  diagram whose sites consist of the unit (feature) pixels in the image. The first
  algorithm, which is of primarily theoretical interest, constructs the complete Voronoi
  diagram. The second, more practical, algorithm constructs the Voronoi diagram where
  it intersects the horizontal lines passing through the image pixel centers. Extensions
  to higher dimensional images and to other distance functions are also discussed.
