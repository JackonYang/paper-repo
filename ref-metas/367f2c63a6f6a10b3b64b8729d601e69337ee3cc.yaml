paperAbstract: Deep neural network acoustic models produce substantial gains in large
  vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems. Emerging work with rectified linear
  (ReL) hidden units demonstrates additional gains in final system performance relative
  to more commonly used sigmoidal nonlinearities. In this work, we explore the use
  of deep rectifier networks as acoustic models for the 300 hour Switchboard conversational
  speech recognition task. Using simple training procedures without pretraining, networks
  with rectifier nonlinearities produce 2% absolute reductions in word error rates
  over their sigmoidal counterparts. We analyze hidden layer representations to quantify
  differences in how ReL units encode inputs as compared to sigmoidal units. Finally,
  we evaluate a variant of the ReL unit with a gradient more amenable to optimization
  in an attempt to further improve deep rectifier networks.
