paperAbstract: "We develop a representation suitable for the unconstrained recognition\
  \ of words in natural images: the general case of no fixed lexicon and unknown length.\
  \ \nTo this end we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture\
  \ which incorporates a Conditional Random Field (CRF) graphical model, taking the\
  \ whole word image as a single input. The unaries of the CRF are provided by a CNN\
  \ that predicts characters at each position of the output, while higher order terms\
  \ are provided by another CNN that detects the presence of N-grams. We show that\
  \ this entire model (CRF, character predictor, N-gram predictor) can be jointly\
  \ optimised by back-propagating the structured output loss, essentially requiring\
  \ the system to perform multi-task learning, and training uses purely synthetically\
  \ generated data. The resulting model is a more accurate system on standard real-world\
  \ text recognition benchmarks than character prediction alone, setting a benchmark\
  \ for systems that have not been trained on a particular lexicon. In addition, our\
  \ model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in lexicon-constrained scenarios, without\
  \ being specifically modelled for constrained recognition. To test the generalisation\
  \ of our model, we also perform experiments with random alpha-numeric strings to\
  \ evaluate the method when no visual language model is applicable."
