paperAbstract: The essence of distantly supervised relation extraction is that it
  is an incomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features.
  To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification
  problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate
  relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity
  pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features
  with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that
  the rank of item-byfeature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization
  models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label
  matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation
  (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used
  datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank
  matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art
  methods.
