paperAbstract: Activity recognition in video is dominated by low- and mid-level features,
  and while demonstrably capable, by nature, these features carry little semantic
  meaning. Inspired by the recent object bank approach to image representation, we
  present Action Bank, a new high-level representation of video. Action bank is comprised
  of many individual action detectors sampled broadly in semantic space as well as
  viewpoint space. Our representation is constructed to be semantically rich and even
  when paired with simple linear SVM classifiers is capable of highly discriminative
  performance. We have tested action bank on four major activity recognition benchmarks.
  In all cases, our performance is better than the state of the art, namely 98.2%
  on KTH (better by 3.3%), 95.0% on UCF Sports (better by 3.7%), 57.9% on UCF50 (baseline
  is 47.9%), and 26.9% on HMDB51 (baseline is 23.2%). Furthermore, when we analyze
  the classifiers, we find strong transfer of semantics from the constituent action
  detectors to the bank classifier.
