paperAbstract: Semantic taxonomies such as WordNet provide a rich source of knowledge
  for natural language processing applications, but are expensive to build, maintain,
  and extend. Motivated by the problem of automatically constructing and extending
  such taxonomies, in this paper we present a new algorithm for automatically learning
  hypernym (is-a) relations from text. Our method generalizes earlier work that had
  relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify
  hypernym pairs. Using "dependency path" features extracted from parse trees, we
  introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns.
  Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically
  extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel
  pairs. On our evaluation task (determining whether two nouns in a news article participate
  in a hypernym relationship), our automatically extracted database of hypernyms attains
  both higher precision and higher recall than WordNet.
