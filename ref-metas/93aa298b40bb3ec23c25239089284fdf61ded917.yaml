paperAbstract: Learning general functional dependencies is one of the main goals in
  machine learning. Recent progress in kernel-based methods has focused on designing
  flexible and powerful input representations. This paper addresses the complementary
  issue of problems involving complex outputs such as multiple dependent output variables
  and structured output spaces. We propose to generalize multiclass Support Vector
  Machine learning in a formulation that involves features extracted jointly from
  inputs and outputs. The resulting optimization problem is solved efficiently by
  a cutting plane algorithm that exploits the sparseness and structural decomposition
  of the problem. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method on
  problems ranging from supervised grammar learning and named-entity recognition,
  to taxonomic text classification and sequence alignment.
