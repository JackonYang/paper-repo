paperAbstract: This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features
  from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views
  of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and
  are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion,
  change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features
  are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched
  with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This
  paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition.
  The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features
  from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
  transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing
  verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This
  approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion
  while achieving near real-time performance.
