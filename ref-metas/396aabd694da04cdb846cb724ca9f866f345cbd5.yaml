paperAbstract: We explore efficient domain adaptation for the task of statistical
  machine translation based on extracting sentences from a large general-domain parallel
  corpus that are most relevant to the target domain. These sentences may be selected
  with simple cross-entropy based methods, of which we present three. As these sentences
  are not themselves identical to the in-domain data, we call them pseudo in-domain
  subcorpora. These subcorpora -- 1% the size of the original -- can then used to
  train small domain-adapted Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems which outperform
  systems trained on the entire corpus. Performance is further improved when we use
  these domain-adapted models in combination with a true in-domain model. The results
  show that more training data is not always better, and that best results are attained
  via proper domain-relevant data selection, as well as combining in- and general-domain
  systems during decoding.
