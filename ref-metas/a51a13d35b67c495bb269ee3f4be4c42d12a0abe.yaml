paperAbstract: Imagery texts are usually organized as a hierarchy of several visual
  elements, i.e. characters, words, text lines and text blocks. Among these elements,
  character is the most basic one for various languages such as Western, Chinese,
  Japanese, mathematical expression and etc. It is natural and convenient to construct
  a common text detection engine based on character detectors. However, training character
  detectors requires a vast of location annotated characters, which are expensive
  to obtain. Actually, the existing real text datasets are mostly annotated in word
  or line level. To remedy this dilemma, we propose a weakly supervised framework
  that can utilize word annotations, either in tight quadrangles or the more loose
  bounding boxes, for character detector training. When applied in scene text detection,
  we are thus able to train a robust character detector by exploiting word annotations
  in the rich large-scale real scene text datasets, e.g. ICDAR15 [19] and COCO-text
  [39]. The character detector acts as a key role in the pipeline of our text detection
  engine. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several challenging scene
  text detection benchmarks. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our pipeline by
  various scenarios, including deformed text detection and math expression recognition.
