paperAbstract: "The focus of this paper is speeding up the application of convolutional\
  \ neural networks. While delivering impressive results across a range of computer\
  \ vision and machine learning tasks, these networks are computationally demanding,\
  \ limiting their deployability. Convolutional layers generally consume the bulk\
  \ of the processing time, and so in this work we present two simple schemes for\
  \ drastically speeding up these layers. This is achieved by exploiting cross-channel\
  \ or filter redundancy to construct a low rank basis of filters that are rank-1\
  \ in the spatial domain. Our methods are architecture agnostic, and can be easily\
  \ applied to existing CPU and GPU convolutional frameworks for tuneable speedup\
  \ performance. We demonstrate this with a real world network designed for scene\
  \ text character recognition [15], showing a possible 2.5\xD7 speedup with no loss\
  \ in accuracy, and 4.5\xD7 speedup with less than 1% drop in accuracy, still achieving\
  \ state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks."
