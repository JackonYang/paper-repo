paperAbstract: 'We propose a method for object detection in cluttered real images,
  given a single hand-drawn example as model. The image edges are partitioned into
  contour segments and organized in an image representation which encodes their interconnections:
  the Contour Segment Network. The object detection problem is formulated as finding
  paths through the network resembling the model outlines, and a computationally efficient
  detection technique is presented. An extensive experimental evaluation on detecting
  five diverse object classes over hundreds of images demonstrates that our method
  works in very cluttered images, allows for scale changes and considerable intra-class
  shape variation, is robust to interrupted contours, and is computationally efficient.'
