paperAbstract: An integrated OCR system for mathematical documents, called INFTY,
  is presented. INFTY consists of four procedures, i.e., layout analysis, character
  recognition, structure analysis of mathematical expressions, and manual error correction.
  In those procedures, several novel techniques are utilized for better recognition
  performance. Experimental results on about 500 pages of mathematical documents showed
  high character recognition rates on both mathematical expressions and ordinary texts,
  and sufficient performance on the structure analysis of the mathematical expressions.
