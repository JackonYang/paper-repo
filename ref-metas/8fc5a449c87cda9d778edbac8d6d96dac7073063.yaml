paperAbstract: "A major focus of modern biological research is the understanding of\
  \ how genomic variation relates to disease. Although there are significant ongoing\
  \ efforts to capture this understanding in curated resources, much of the information\
  \ remains locked in unstructured sources, in particular, the scientific literature.\
  \ Thus, there have been several text mining systems developed to target extraction\
  \ of mutations and other genetic variation from the literature. We have performed\
  \ the first study of the use of text mining for the recovery of genetic variants\
  \ curated directly from the literature. We consider two curated databases, COSMIC\
  \ (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) and InSiGHT (International Society\
  \ for Gastro-intestinal Hereditary Tumours), that contain explicit links to the\
  \ source literature for each included mutation. Our analysis shows that the recall\
  \ of the mutations catalogued in the databases using a text mining tool is very\
  \ low, despite the well-established good performance of the tool and even when the\
  \ full text of the associated article is available for processing. We demonstrate\
  \ that this discrepancy can be explained by considering the supplementary material\
  \ linked to the published articles, not previously considered by text mining tools.\
  \ Although it is anecdotally known that supplementary material contains \u2018all\
  \ of the information\u2019, and some researchers have speculated about the role\
  \ of supplementary material (Schenck et al. Extraction of genetic mutations associated\
  \ with cancer from public literature. J Health Med Inform 2012;S2:2.), our analysis\
  \ substantiates the significant extent to which this material is critical. Our results\
  \ highlight the need for literature mining tools to consider not only the narrative\
  \ content of a publication but also the full set of material related to a publication."
