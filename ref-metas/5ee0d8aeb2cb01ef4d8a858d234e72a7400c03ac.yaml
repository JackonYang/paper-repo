paperAbstract: We introduce a new method of constructing kernels on sets whose elements
  are discrete structures like strings, trees and graphs. The method can be applied
  iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators
  of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis
  kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability
  distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized
  regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead
  to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions.
  Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
  are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method.
