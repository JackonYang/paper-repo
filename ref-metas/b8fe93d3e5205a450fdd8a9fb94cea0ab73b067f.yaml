paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we describe BYBLOS, the BBN continuous speech recognition
  system. The system, designed for large vocabulary applications, integrates acoustic,
  phonetic, lexical, and linguistic knowledge sources to achieve high recognition
  performance. The basic approach, as described in previous papers [1, 2], makes extensive
  use of robust context-dependent models of phonetic coarticulation using Hidden Markov
  Models (HMM). We describe the components of the BYBLOS system, including: signal
  processing frontend, dictionary, phonetic model training system, word model generator,
  grammar and decoder. In recognition experiments, we demonstrate consistently high
  word recognition performance on continuous speech across: speakers, task domains,
  and grammars of varying complexity. In speaker-dependent mode, where 15 minutes
  of speech is required for training to a speaker, 98.5% word accuracy has been achieved
  in continuous speech for a 350-word task, using grammars with perplexity ranging
  from 30 to 60. With only 15 seconds of training speech we demonstrate performance
  of 97% using a grammar.'
