paperAbstract: "There is presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks\
  \ to mimic \"qualitative reasoning\" by manipulating neural incodings of symbols.\
  \ Less work has been performed on using neural networks to process floating point\
  \ numbers and it is sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently\
  \ inaccurate and therefore best suited for \"fuzzy\" qualitative reasoning. Nevertheless,\
  \ the potential speed of massively parallel operations make neural net \"number\
  \ crunching\" an interesting topic to explore. In this paper we discuss some of\
  \ our work in which we demonstrate that for certain applications neural networks\
  \ can achieve significantly higher numerical accuracy than more conventional techniques.\
  \ In particular, prediction of future values of a chaotic time series can be performed\
  \ with exceptionally high accuracy. We analyze how a neural net is able to do this,\
  \ and in the process show that a large class of functions from Rn \u2192 Rm may\
  \ be accurately approximated by a backpropagation neural net with just two \"hidden\"\
  \ layers. The network uses this functional approximation to perform either interpolation\
  \ (signal processing applications) or extrapolation (symbol processing applications).\
  \ Neural nets therefore use quite familiar methods to perform their tasks. The geometrical\
  \ viewpoint advocated here seems to be a useful approach to analyzing neural network\
  \ operation and relates neural networks to well studied topics in functional approximation."
