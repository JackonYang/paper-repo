paperAbstract: 'This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information
  networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such
  as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph
  embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually
  contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method
  called the ``LINE,'''' which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks:
  undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed
  objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures.
  An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical
  stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency
  of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a
  variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social
  networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able
  to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges
  in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available
  online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE}}.'
