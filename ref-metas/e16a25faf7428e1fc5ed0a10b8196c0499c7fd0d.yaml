paperAbstract: Statistical applications in fields such as bioinformatics, information
  retrieval, speech processing, image processing and communications often involve
  large-scale models in which thousands or millions of random variables are linked
  in complex ways. Graphical models provide a general methodology for approaching
  these problems, and indeed many of the models developed by researchers in these
  applied fields are instances of the general graphical model formalism. We review
  some of the basic ideas underlying graphical models, including the algorithmic ideas
  that allow graphical models to be deployed in large-scale data analysis problems.
  We also present examples of graphical models in bioinformatics, error-control coding
  and language processing.
