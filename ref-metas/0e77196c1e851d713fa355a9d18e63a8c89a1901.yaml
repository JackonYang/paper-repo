paperAbstract: We propose a novel easy-to-implement stroke detector based on an efficient
  pixel intensity comparison to surrounding pixels. Stroke-specific keypoints are
  efficiently detected and text fragments are subsequently extracted by local thresholding
  guided by keypoint properties. Classification based on effectively calculated features
  then eliminates non-text regions. The stroke-specific keypoints produce 2 times
  less region segmentations and still detect 25% more characters than the commonly
  exploited MSER detector and the process is 4 times faster. After a novel efficient
  classification step, the number of regions is reduced to 7 times less than the standard
  method and is still almost 3 times faster. All stages of the proposed pipeline are
  scale-and rotation-invariant and support a wide variety of scripts (Latin, Hebrew,
  Chinese, etc.) and fonts. When the proposed detector is plugged into a scene text
  localization and recognition pipeline, a state-of-the-art text localization accuracy
  is maintained whilst the processing time is significantly reduced.
