paperAbstract: Scene text detection has been made great progress in recent years.
  The detection manners are evolving from axisaligned rectangle to rotated rectangle
  and further to quadrangle. However, current datasets contain very little curve text,
  which can be widely observed in scene images such as signboard, product name and
  so on. To raise the concerns of reading curve text in the wild, in this paper, we
  construct a curve text dataset named CTW1500, which includes over 10k text annotations
  in 1,500 images (1000 for training and 500 for testing). Based on this dataset,
  we pioneering propose a polygon based curve text detector (CTD) which can directly
  detect curve text without empirical combination. Moreover, by seamlessly integrating
  the recurrent transverse and longitudinal offset connection (TLOC), the proposed
  method can be end-to-end trainable to learn the inherent connection among the position
  offsets. This allows the CTD to explore context information instead of predicting
  points independently, resulting in more smooth and accurate detection. We also propose
  two simple but effective post-processing methods named nonpolygon suppress (NPS)
  and polygonal non-maximum suppression (PNMS) to further improve the detection accuracy.
  Furthermore, the proposed approach in this paper is designed in an universal manner,
  which can also be trained with rectangular or quadrilateral bounding boxes without
  extra efforts. Experimental results on CTW-1500 demonstrate our method with only
  a light backbone can outperform state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. By
  evaluating only in the curve or non-curve subset, the CTD + TLOC can still achieve
  the best results. Code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/Curve-Text-Detector.
