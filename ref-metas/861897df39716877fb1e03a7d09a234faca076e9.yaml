paperAbstract: "We describe a learning-based method for low-level vision problems\u2014\
  estimating scenes from images. We generate a synthetic world of scenes and their\
  \ corresponding rendered images, modeling their relationships with a Markov network.\
  \ Bayesian belief propagation allows us to efficiently find a local maximum of the\
  \ posterior probability for the scene, given an image. We call this approach VISTA\u2014\
  Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201Csuper-resolution\u201D\
  \ problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing\
  \ good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply\
  \ it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading\
  \ from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions.\
  \ For the motion estimation problem in a \u201Cblobs world\u201D, we show figure/ground\
  \ discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from\
  \ application of the same probabilistic machinery."
