paperAbstract: ACRONYM Is a model-based image understanding system. It demonstrates
  mechanisms for interpretation of images with generic object classes and generic
  viewing conditions, in a way that is generalizable. It incorporates a powerful geometric
  modeling capability with a high level modeling language for natural communication
  with the user In terms of object models. A user gives high level descriptions of
  both generic and specific instances of objects. A rule-based Inference system produces
  a viewpoint dependent symbolic summary of the predicted appearance of the objects.
  This geometric reasoning capability enables the system to incorporate and relate
  knowledge and information at different levels. This summary drives a powerful syntactic
  matcher to find instances of the objects in preprocessed images.
