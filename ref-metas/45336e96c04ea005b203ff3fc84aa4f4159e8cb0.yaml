paperAbstract: A human action recognition method based on a hidden Markov model (HMM)
  is proposed. It is a feature-based bottom-up approach that is characterized by its
  learning capability and time-scale invariability. To apply HMMs, one set of time-sequential
  images is transformed into an image feature vector sequence, and the sequence is
  converted into a symbol sequence by vector quantization. In learning human action
  categories, the parameters of the HMMs, one per category, are optimized so as to
  best describe the training sequences from the category. To recognize an observed
  sequence, the HMM which best matches the sequence is chosen. Experimental results
  for real time-sequential images of sports scenes show recognition rates higher than
  90%. The recognition rate is improved by increasing the number of people used to
  generate the training data, indicating the possibility of establishing a person-independent
  action recognizer.<<ETX>>
