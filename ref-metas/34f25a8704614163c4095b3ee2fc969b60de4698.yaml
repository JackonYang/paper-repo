paperAbstract: Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful
  machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks.
  Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting
  by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout
  is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units
  (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents
  units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential
  number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate
  the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply
  using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces
  overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show
  that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning
  tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology,
  obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.
