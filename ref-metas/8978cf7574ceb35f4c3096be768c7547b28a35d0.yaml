paperAbstract: We show how to use complementary priors to eliminate the explaining-away
  effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have
  many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm
  that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the
  top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm
  is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using
  a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network
  with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution
  of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better
  digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional
  manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy
  landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines
  by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in
  mind.
