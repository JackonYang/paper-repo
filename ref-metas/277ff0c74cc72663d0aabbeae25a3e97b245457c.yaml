paperAbstract: Ordered labeled trees are trees in which the left-to-right order among
  siblings is significant. The distance between two ordered trees is considered to
  be the weighted number of edit operations (insert, delete, and modify) to transform
  one tree to another. The problem of approximate tree matching is also considered.
  Specifically, algorithms are designed to answer the following kinds of questions:1.
  What is the distance between two trees? 2. What is the minimum distance between
  $T_1 $ and $T_2 $ when zero or more subtrees can be removed from $T_2 $? 3. Let
  the pruning of a tree at node n mean removing all the descendants of node n. The
  analogous question for prunings as for subtrees is answered.A dynamic programming
  algorithm is presented to solve the three questions in sequential time $O(|T_1 |
  \times |T_2 | \times \min ({\textit{depth}}(T_1 ),{\textit{leaves}}(T_1 )) \times
  \min ({\textit{depth}}(T_2 ),{\textit{leaves}}(T_2 )))$ and space $O(|T_1 | \times
  |T_2 |)$ compared with $O(|T_1 | \times |T_2 | \t...
