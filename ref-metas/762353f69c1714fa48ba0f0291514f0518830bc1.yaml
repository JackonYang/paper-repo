paperAbstract: We propose a new method for indexing large image databases. The method
  incorporates neural network learning algorithms and pattern recognition techniques
  to construct an image pattern dictionary. Image retrieval is then formulated as
  a process of dictionary search to compute the best matching codeword, which in turn
  indexes into the database items. Experimental results are presented.
