paperAbstract: We present a vision system for the 3-D model-based tracking of unconstrained
  human movement. Using image sequences acquired simultaneously from multiple views,
  we recover the 3-D body pose at each time instant without the use of markers. The
  pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails finding the
  pose parameters of a graphical human model whose synthesized appearance is most
  similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. The
  models used for this purpose are acquired from the images. We use a decomposition
  approach and a best-first technique to search through the high dimensional pose
  parameter space. A robust variant of chamfer matching is used as a fast similarity
  measure between synthesized and real edge images. We present initial tracking results
  from a large new Humans-in-Action (HIA) database containing more than 2500 frames
  in each of four orthogonal views. They contain subjects involved in a variety of
  activities, of various degrees of complexity, ranging from the more simple one-person
  hand waving to the challenging two-person close interaction in the Argentine Tango.
