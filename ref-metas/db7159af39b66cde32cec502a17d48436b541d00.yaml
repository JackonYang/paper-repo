paperAbstract: This paper presents a new method for constructing models from a set
  of positive and negative sample images; the method requires no manual extraction
  of significant objects or features. Our model representation is based on two layers.
  The first one consists of "generic" descriptors which represent sets of similar
  rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar,
  but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second
  layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the "generic" descriptors over
  neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of "spatial-frequency"
  clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant.
  Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture "texture-like"
  visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic
  model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases
  the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic
  score. Experimental results for "textured" animals and faces show a very good performance
  for retrieval as well as localization.
