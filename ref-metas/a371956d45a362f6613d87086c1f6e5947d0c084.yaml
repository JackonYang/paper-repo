paperAbstract: In this study, a discriminative detector for object context is designed
  and tested. The context-feature is simple to implement, feed-forward, and effective
  across multiple object types in a street-scenes environment.Using context alone,
  we demonstrate robust detection of locations likely to contain bicycles, cars, and
  pedestrians. Furthermore, experiments are conducted so as to address several open
  questions regarding visual context. Specifically, it is demonstrated that context
  may be determined from low level visual features (simple color and texture descriptors)
  sampled over a wide receptive field. At least for the framework tested, high level
  semantic knowledge, e.g, the nature of the surrounding objects, is superfluous.
  Finally, it is shown that when the target object is unambiguously visible, context
  is only marginally useful.
