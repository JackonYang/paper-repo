paperAbstract: The chief difficulty in object recognition is that objects' classes
  are obscured by a large number of extraneous sources of variability, such as pose
  and part deformation. These sources of variation can be represented by symmetry
  groups, sets of composable transformations that preserve object identity. Convolutional
  neural networks (convnets) achieve a degree of translational invariance by computing
  feature maps over the translation group, but cannot handle other groups. As a result,
  these groups' effects have to be approximated by small translations, which often
  requires augmenting datasets and leads to high sample complexity. In this paper,
  we introduce deep symmetry networks (symnets), a generalization of convnets that
  forms feature maps over arbitrary symmetry groups. Symnets use kernel-based interpolation
  to tractably tie parameters and pool over symmetry spaces of any dimension. Like
  convnets, they are trained with backpropagation. The composition of feature transformations
  through the layers of a symnet provides a new approach to deep learning. Experiments
  on NORB and MNIST-rot show that symnets over the affine group greatly reduce sample
  complexity relative to convnets by better capturing the symmetries in the data.
