paperAbstract: Researchers in computer vision and pattern recognition have worked
  on automatic techniques for recognizing human faces for the last 20 years. While
  some systems, especially template-based ones, have been quite successful on expressionless,
  frontal views of faces with controlled lighting, not much work has taken face recognizers
  beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal is to build a face recognizer that
  works under varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle face relations
  in depth. Building on successful template-based systems, our basic approach is to
  represent faces with templates from multiple model views that cover different poses
  from the viewing sphere. To recognize a novel view, the recognizer locates the eyes
  and nose features, uses these locations to geometrically register the input with
  model views, and then uses correlation on model templates to find the best match
  in the data base of people. Our system has achieved a recognition rate of 98% on
  a data base of 62 people containing 10 testing and 15 modeling views per person.<<ETX>>
