paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nComputer scientists designing machine vision\
  \ systems, psychologists working in visual perception, visual neurophysiologists,\
  \ and theoretical biologists will derive a deeper understanding of visual function\
  \ - in particular the computations that the human visual system uses to analyze\
  \ motion-from the important research reported in this book. \nThe organization of\
  \ movement in the changing image that reaches the eye provides our visual system\
  \ with a valuable source of information for analyzing the structure of our surroundings.\
  \ This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement\
  \ to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates\
  \ the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by\
  \ any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals\
  \ of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision\
  \ system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that\
  \ can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms\
  \ specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute\
  \ to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer\
  \ system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches\
  \ of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting\
  \ analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision\
  \ system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate\
  \ from MIT. She is a Research Scientist in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\
  \ and associate director of theCenter for Biological Information Processing at the\
  \ Whitaker College of Health Sciences, Technology, and Management. The Measurement\
  \ of Visual Motion is an ACM Distinguished Dissertation."
