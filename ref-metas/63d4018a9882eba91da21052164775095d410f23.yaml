paperAbstract: There has been a recent push in extraction of 3D spatial layout of
  scenes. However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects
  and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation
  of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical
  world. We show that augmenting current structured prediction techniques with volumetric
  reasoning significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art.
