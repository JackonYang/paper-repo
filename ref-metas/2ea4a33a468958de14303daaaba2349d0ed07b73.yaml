paperAbstract: The Boltzmann machine learning procedure has been successfully applied
  in deterministic networks of analog units that use a mean field approximation to
  efficiently simulate a truly stochastic system (Peterson and Anderson 1987). This
  type of deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learns much faster than the equivalent
  stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM), but since the learning procedure for DBM's is
  only based on an analogy with SBM's, there is no existing proof that it performs
  gradient descent in any function, and it has only been justified by simulations.
  By using the appropriate interpretation for the way in which a DBM represents the
  probability of an output vector given an input vector, it is shown that the DBM
  performs steepest descent in the same function as the original SBM, except at rare
  discontinuities. A very simple way of forcing the weights to become symmetrical
  is also described, and this makes the DBM more biologically plausible than back-propagation
  (Werbos 1974; Parker 1985; Rumelhart et al. 1986).
