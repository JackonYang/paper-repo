paperAbstract: We present a discriminatively trained model for joint modelling of
  object class labels (e.g. "person", "dog", "chair", etc.) and their visual attributes
  (e.g. "has head", "furry", "metal", etc.). We treat attributes of an object as latent
  variables in our model and capture the correlations among attributes using an undirected
  graphical model built from training data. The advantage of our model is that it
  allows us to infer object class labels using the information of both the test image
  itself and its (latent) attributes. Our model unifies object class prediction and
  attribute prediction in a principled framework. It is also flexible enough to deal
  with different performance measurements. Our experimental results provide quantitative
  evidence that attributes can improve object naming.
