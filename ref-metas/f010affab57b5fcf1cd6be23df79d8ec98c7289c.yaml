paperAbstract: 'We present TriviaQA, a challenging reading comprehension dataset containing
  over 650K question-answer-evidence triples. TriviaQA includes 95K question-answer
  pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents,
  six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering
  the questions. We show that, in comparison to other recently introduced large-scale
  datasets, TriviaQA (1) has relatively complex, compositional questions, (2) has
  considerable syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding
  answer-evidence sentences, and (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to find
  answers. We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature-based classifier and
  a state-of-the-art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD reading comprehension.
  Neither approach comes close to human performance (23% and 40% vs. 80%), suggesting
  that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that is worth significant future study.'
