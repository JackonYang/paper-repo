paperAbstract: Recent work has shown that the integration of visual information into
  text-based models can substantially improve model predictions, but so far only visual
  information extracted from static images has been used. In this paper, we consider
  the problem of grounding sentences describing actions in visual information extracted
  from videos. We present a general purpose corpus that aligns high quality videos
  with multiple natural language descriptions of the actions portrayed in the videos,
  together with an annotation of how similar the action descriptions are to each other.
  Experimental results demonstrate that a text-based model of similarity between actions
  improves substantially when combined with visual information from videos depicting
  the described actions.
