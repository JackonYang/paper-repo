paperAbstract: Text appearing in video provides semantic knowledge and significant
  information for video indexing and retrieval system. This paper proposes an effective
  method for text detection in video based on the similarity in stroke width of text
  (which is defined as the distance between two edges of a stroke). From the observation
  that text regions can be characterized by a dominant fixed stroke width, edge detection
  with local adaptive thresholds is first devised to keep text- while reducing background-regions.
  Second, morphological dilation operator with adaptive structuring element size determined
  by stroke width value is exploited to roughly localize text regions. Finally, to
  reduce false alarm and refine text location, a new multi-frame refinement method
  is applied. Experimental results show that the proposed method is not only robust
  to different levels of background complexity, but also effective to different fonts
  (size, color) and languages of text.
