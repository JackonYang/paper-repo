paperAbstract: "Both entity and relation extraction can benefit from being performed\
  \ jointly, allowing each task to correct the errors of the other. Most existing\
  \ neural joint methods extract entities and relations separately and achieve joint\
  \ learning\_ through parameter sharing, leading to a drawback that information between\
  \ output entities and relations cannot be fully exploited. In this paper, we convert\
  \ the joint task into a directed graph by designing a novel graph scheme and propose\
  \ a transition-based approach to generate the directed graph incrementally, which\
  \ can achieve joint learning through joint decoding. Our method can model underlying\
  \ dependencies not only between entities and relations, but also between relations.\
  \ Experiments on NewYork Times (NYT) corpora show that our approach outperforms\
  \ the state-of-the-art methods.\_"
