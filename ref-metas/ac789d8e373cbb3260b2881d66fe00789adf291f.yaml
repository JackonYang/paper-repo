paperAbstract: In this paper we give a simple account of local computation of marginal
  probabilities when the joint probability distribution is given in factored form
  and the sets of variables involved in the factors form a hypertree. Previous expositions
  of such local computation have emphasized conditional probability. We believe this
  emphasis is misplaced. What is essential to local computation is a factorization.
  It is not essential that this factorization be interpreted in terms of conditional
  probabilities. The account given here avoids the divisions required by conditional
  probabilities and generalizes readily to alternative measures of subjective probability,
  such as Dempster-Shafer or Spohnian belief functions.
