paperAbstract: A phoneme based, speaker-dependent continuous-speech recognition system
  embedding a multilayer perceptron (MLP) (i.e. a feedforward artificial neural network)
  into a hidden Markov model (HMM) approach is described. Contextual information from
  a sliding window on the input frames is used to improve frame or phoneme classification
  performance over the corresponding performance for simple maximum-likelihood probabilities,
  or even maximum a posteriori (MAP) probabilities which are estimated without the
  benefit of context. Performance for a simple discrete density HMM system appears
  to be somewhat better when MLP methods are used to estimate the probabilities.<<ETX>>
