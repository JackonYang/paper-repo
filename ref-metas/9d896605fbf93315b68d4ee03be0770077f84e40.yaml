paperAbstract: We posit that visually descriptive language offers computer vision
  researchers both information about the world, and information about how people describe
  the world. The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to
  the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system
  to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits
  both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition
  algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant
  sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true
  to the specific image content than previous work.
