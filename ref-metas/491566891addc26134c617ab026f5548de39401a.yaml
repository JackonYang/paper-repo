paperAbstract: Speech recognition systems incorporate a language model which, at each
  stage of the recognition task, assigns a probability of occurrence to each word
  in the vocabulary. A class of Markov language models identified by Jelinek has achieved
  considerable success in this domain. A modification of the Markov approach, which
  assigns higher probabilities to recently used words, is proposed and tested against
  a pure Markov model. Parameter calculation and comparison of the two models both
  involve use of the LOB Corpus of tagged modern English.
