paperAbstract: Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging
  task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with
  the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even
  the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either
  through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively
  little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems
  rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech
  and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes
  an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically
  designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains
  long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained
  handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7
  percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming
  a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness
  to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze
  its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between
  the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.
