paperAbstract: 'Kernel methods provide a powerful and unified framework for pattern
  discovery, motivating algorithms that can act on general types of data (e.g. strings,
  vectors or text) and look for general types of relations (e.g. rankings, classifications,
  regressions, clusters). The application areas range from neural networks and pattern
  recognition to machine learning and data mining. This book, developed from lectures
  and tutorials, fulfils two major roles: firstly it provides practitioners with a
  large toolkit of algorithms, kernels and solutions ready to use for standard pattern
  discovery problems in fields such as bioinformatics, text analysis, image analysis.
  Secondly it provides an easy introduction for students and researchers to the growing
  field of kernel-based pattern analysis, demonstrating with examples how to handcraft
  an algorithm or a kernel for a new specific application, and covering all the necessary
  conceptual and mathematical tools to do so.'
