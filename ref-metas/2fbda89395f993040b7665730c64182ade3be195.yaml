paperAbstract: For understanding generic documents, information like font sizes, column
  layout, and generally the positioning of words may carry semantic information that
  is crucial for solving a downstream document intelligence task. Our novel BERTgrid,
  which is based on Chargrid by Katti et al. (2018), represents a document as a grid
  of contextualized word piece embedding vectors, thereby making its spatial structure
  and semantics accessible to the processing neural network. The contextualized embedding
  vectors are retrieved from a BERT language model. We use BERTgrid in combination
  with a fully convolutional network on a semantic instance segmentation task for
  extracting fields from invoices. We demonstrate its performance on tabulated line
  item and document header field extraction.
