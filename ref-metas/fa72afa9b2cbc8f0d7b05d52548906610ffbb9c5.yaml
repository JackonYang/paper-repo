paperAbstract: Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
  translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
  machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly
  tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for
  neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists
  of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which
  a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of
  a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic
  encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to
  automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to
  predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.
  With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
  state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.
  Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the
  model agree well with our intuition.
