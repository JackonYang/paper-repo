paperAbstract: We develop an approach to object recognition based on matching shapes
  and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The
  key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between
  an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor,
  the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm.
  The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of
  other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor.
  We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences
  between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are
  used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this
  score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as
  well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST
  dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming
  other published techniques.
