paperAbstract: "One of the most exciting advances in early vision has been the development\
  \ of efficient energy minimization algorithms. Many early vision tasks require labeling\
  \ each pixel with some quantity such as depth or texture. While many such problems\
  \ can be elegantly expressed in the language of Markov Random Fields (MRF's), the\
  \ resulting energy minimization problems were widely viewed as intractable. Recently,\
  \ algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to\
  \ be very powerful: for example, such methods form the basis for almost all the\
  \ top-performing stereo methods. Unfortunately, most papers define their own energy\
  \ function, which is minimized with a specific algorithm of their choice. As a result,\
  \ the tradeoffs among different energy minimization algorithms are not well understood.\
  \ In this paper we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks, which we use\
  \ to compare the solution quality and running time of several common energy minimization\
  \ algorithms. We investigate three promising recent methods\u2014graph cuts, LBP,\
  \ and tree-reweighted message passing\u2014as well as the well-known older iterated\
  \ conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published\
  \ energy functions used for stereo, image stitching and interactive segmentation.\
  \ We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers\
  \ to easily switch between optimization methods with minimal overhead. We expect\
  \ that the availability of our benchmarks and interface will make it significantly\
  \ easier for vision researchers to adopt the best method for their specific problems.\
  \ Benchmarks, code, results and images are available at http://vision.middlebury.edu/MRF."
