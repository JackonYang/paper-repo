paperAbstract: We introduce a very large family of binary features for two-dimensional
  shapes. The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive
  learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for
  every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements
  express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations
  and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They
  are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative
  ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of
  shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are
  aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully
  automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified
  handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent.
