paperAbstract: "Learning an algorithm from examples is a fundamental problem that\
  \ has been widely studied. Recently it has been addressed using neural networks,\
  \ in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). These are fully differentiable\
  \ computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming. Despite their\
  \ appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they are\
  \ not parallel and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded.\
  \ \nWe present a neural network architecture to address this problem: the Neural\
  \ GPU. It is based on a type of convolutional gated recurrent unit and, like the\
  \ NTM, is computationally universal. Unlike the NTM, the Neural GPU is highly parallel\
  \ which makes it easier to train and efficient to run. \nAn essential property of\
  \ algorithms is their ability to handle inputs of arbitrary size. We show that the\
  \ Neural GPU can be trained on short instances of an algorithmic task and successfully\
  \ generalize to long instances. We verified it on a number of tasks including long\
  \ addition and long multiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the\
  \ Neural GPU on numbers with upto 20 bits and observe no errors whatsoever while\
  \ testing it, even on much longer numbers. \nTo achieve these results we introduce\
  \ a technique for training deep recurrent networks: parameter sharing relaxation.\
  \ We also found a small amount of dropout and gradient noise to have a large positive\
  \ effect on learning and generalization."
