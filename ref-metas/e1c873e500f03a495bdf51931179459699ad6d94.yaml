paperAbstract: "We construct a Bayesian model that integrates topdown with bottom-up\
  \ criteria, capitalizing on their relative merits to obtain figure-ground segmentation\
  \ that is shape-specific and texture invariant. A hierarchy of bottom-up segments\
  \ in multiple scales is used to construct a prior on all possible figure-ground\
  \ segmentations of the image. This prior is used by our top-down part to query and\
  \ detect object parts in the image using stored shape templates. The detected parts\
  \ are integrated to produce a global approximation for the object\u2019s shape,\
  \ which is then used by an inference algorithm to produce the final segmentation.\
  \ Experiments with a large sample of horse and runner images demonstrate strong\
  \ figure-ground segmentation despite high object and background variability. The\
  \ segmentations are robust to changes in appearance since the matching component\
  \ depends on shape criteria alone. The model may be useful for additional visual\
  \ tasks requiring labeling, such as the segmentation of multiple scene objects."
