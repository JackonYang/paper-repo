paperAbstract: "Is an algorithm with high precision and recall at identifying table-parts\
  \ also good at locating tables? Several document analysis tasks require merging\
  \ or splitting certain document elements to form others. The suitability of the\
  \ commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is arguable,\
  \ since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items at input\
  \ is the same as at output. We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better\
  \ suit document analysis\u2019 needs and show their application to several table\
  \ tasks. In the process, we present a number of robust table location algorithms\
  \ with which we draw a road-map for creating Hidden Markov Models for the task."
