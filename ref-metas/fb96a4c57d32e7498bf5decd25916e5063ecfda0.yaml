paperAbstract: In digital scientific articles tables are a common form of presenting
  information in a structured way. However, the large variability of table layouts
  and the lack of structural information in digital document formats pose significant
  challenges for information retrieval and related tasks. In this paper we present
  two table recognition methods based on unsupervised learning techniques and heuristics
  which automatically detect both the location and the structure of tables within
  a article stored as PDF. For both algorithms the table region detection first identifies
  the bounding boxes of individual tables from a set of labelled text blocks. In the
  second step, two different tabular structure detection methods extract a rectangular
  grid of table cells from the set of words contained in these table regions. We evaluate
  each stage of the algorithms separately and compare performance values on two data
  sets from different domains. We find that the table recognition performance is in
  line with state-of-the-art commercial systems and generalises to the non-scientific
  domain.
