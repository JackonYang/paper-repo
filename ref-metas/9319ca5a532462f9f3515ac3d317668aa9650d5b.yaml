paperAbstract: The structured language model (SLM) aims at predicting the next word
  in a given word string by making a syntactical analysis of the preceding words.
  However, it faces the data sparseness problem because of the large dimensionality
  and diversity of the information available in the syntactic parsing. Previously,
  we proposed using neural network models for the SLM (Emami, A. et al., Proc. ICASSP,
  2003; Emami, Proc. EUROSPEECH'03., 2003). The neural network model is better suited
  to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements
  in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. We present a new method
  of training the neural net based SLM. This procedure makes use of the partial parsing
  hypothesized by the SLM itself, and is more expensive than the approximate training
  method used previously. Experiments with the new training method on the UPenn and
  WSJ corpora show significant reductions in perplexity and word error rate, achieving
  the lowest published results for the given corpora.
