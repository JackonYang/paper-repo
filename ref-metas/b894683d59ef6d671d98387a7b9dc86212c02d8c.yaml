paperAbstract: The watershed is one of the latest segmentation tools developed in
  mathematical morphology. In order to prevent its oversegmentation, the notion of
  dynamics of a minimum, based on geodesic reconstruction, has been proposed. In this
  paper, we extend the notion of dynamics to the contour arcs. This notion acts as
  a measure of the saliency of the contour. Contrary to the dynamics of minima, our
  concept reflects the extension and shape of the corresponding object in the image.
  This representation is also much more natural, because it is expressed in terms
  of partitions of the plane, i.e., segmentations. A hierarchical segmentation process
  is then derived, which gives a compact description of the image, containing all
  the segmentations one can obtain by the notion of dynamics, by means of a simple
  thresholding. Finally, efficient algorithms for computing the geodesic reconstruction
  as well as the dynamics of contours are presented.
