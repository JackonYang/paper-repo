paperAbstract: "An adaptive statistical language model is described, which successfully\
  \ integrates long distance linguistic information with other knowledge sources.\
  \ Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of\
  \ a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we\
  \ propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows\
  \ the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical\
  \ evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation\
  \ and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient.\
  \ Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source\
  \ gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The\
  \ intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are\
  \ consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy\
  \ within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique\
  \ ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is\
  \ guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon\
  \ that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated.\
  \ An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street\
  \ Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline.\
  \ When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced\
  \ its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating\
  \ many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."
