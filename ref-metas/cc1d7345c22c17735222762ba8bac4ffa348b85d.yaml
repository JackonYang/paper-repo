paperAbstract: "We address comparing related, but not identical shapes in images following\
  \ a deformable template strategy. At the heart of this is the notion of an alignment\
  \ between the shapes to be matched. The transformation necessary for alignment and\
  \ the remaining differences after alignment are then used to make a comparison.\
  \ \nA model determines what kind of deformations or alignments are acceptable, and\
  \ what variation in appearance should remain after alignment. This ties strongly\
  \ with the idea that the difference in shape is the residual difference, after some\
  \ family of transformations has been applied for alignment. \nFinding an alignment\
  \ of a model to a novel object involves search through the space of possible alignments.\
  \ In many settings this search is quite difficult. This work shows that the search\
  \ can be approximated by an easier discrete matching problem between key points\
  \ on a model and a novel object. This is a departure from traditional approaches\
  \ to deformable template matching that concentrate on analyzing differential models.\
  \ This thesis presents theories and experiments on searching for, identifying, and\
  \ using alignments found via discrete matchings. \nIn particular we present a mathematical\
  \ and ecological motivation for a medium scale descriptor of shape, geometric blur.\
  \ Geometric blur is an average over transformations of a sparse signal or feature\
  \ channel, and can be computed using a spatially varying convolution. The resulting\
  \ shape descriptors are useful for evaluating local shape similarity. Experiments\
  \ demonstrate their efficacy for image classification and shape correspondence.\
  \ \nFinding alignments between shapes is formulated as an optimization problem over\
  \ discrete matchings between feature points in images. Similarity between putative\
  \ correspondences is measured using geometric blur, and the deformation in the configuration\
  \ of points is measured by summing over deformations in pairwise relationships.\
  \ The snatching problem is formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem\
  \ and approximated with a simple technique. Experimental results indicate that this\
  \ generic model of local shape and deformation is applicable across a wide variety\
  \ of object categories, providing good (currently the best known) performance for\
  \ object recognition and localization on a difficult object recognition benchmark.\
  \ \nFurthermore this generic object alignment strategy can be used to model variation\
  \ in images of an object category, identifying the repeated object structures and\
  \ providing automatic localization of the objects."
