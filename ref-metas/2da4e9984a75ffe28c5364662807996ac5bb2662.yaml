paperAbstract: The visual system can reliably identify objects even when the retinal
  image is transformed considerably by commonly occurring changes in the environment.
  A local learning rule is proposed, which allows a network to learn to generalize
  across such transformations. During the learning phase, the network is exposed to
  temporal sequences of patterns undergoing the transformation. An application of
  the algorithm is presented in which the network learns invariance to shift in retinal
  position. Such a principle may be involved in the development of the characteristic
  shift invariance property of complex cells in the primary visual cortex, and also
  in the development of more complicated invariance properties of neurons in higher
  visual areas.
