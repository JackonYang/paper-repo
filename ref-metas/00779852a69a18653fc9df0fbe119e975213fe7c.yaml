paperAbstract: A psychological space is established for any set of stimuli by determining
  metric distances between the stimuli such that the probability that a response learned
  to any stimulus will generalize to any other is an invariant monotonic function
  of the distance between them. To a good approximation, this probability of generalization
  (i) decays exponentially with this distance, and (ii) does so in accordance with
  one of two metrics, depending on the relation between the dimensions along which
  the stimuli vary. These empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from
  universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may, through
  evolutionary internalization, tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms.
