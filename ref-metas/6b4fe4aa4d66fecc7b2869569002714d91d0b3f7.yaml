paperAbstract: What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the
  central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and interconnexions.
  It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response
  patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field
  arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity
  far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous
  paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses
  to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present
  work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part
  I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This
  approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells,
  but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours.
  In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great
  success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941)
  and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the
  rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this
  work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular
  overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method
  of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large
  populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between
  areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has
  in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups
  during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated
  with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material.
