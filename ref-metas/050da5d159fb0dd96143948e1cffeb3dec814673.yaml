paperAbstract: "Significance In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial\
  \ intelligence, the methods of evaluation largely define the scientific effort.\
  \ Most current evaluations measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification\
  \ of regions according to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not\
  \ the same as understanding. We present here a different evaluation system, in which\
  \ a query engine prepares a written test (\u201Cvisual Turing test\u201D) that uses\
  \ binary questions to probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships\
  \ in addition to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested\
  \ by their accuracy in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative,\
  \ and motivated by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and\
  \ even tell a story about an image, we construct a \u201Cvisual Turing test\u201D\
  : an operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions\
  \ from a given test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either\
  \ provides the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes\
  \ the next question (\u201Cjust-in-time truthing\u201D). The test is then administered\
  \ to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019\
  s answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.\
  \ Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural\
  \ language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned\
  \ from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014\
  the answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,\
  \ is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test is\
  \ only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions that\
  \ follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object, through\
  \ an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other uniquely\
  \ instantiated objects."
