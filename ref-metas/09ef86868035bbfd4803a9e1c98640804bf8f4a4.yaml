paperAbstract: Factor analysis, a statistical method for modeling the covariance structure
  of high dimensional data using a small number of latent variables, can be extended
  by allowing di erent local factor models in di erent regions of the input space.
  This results in a model which concurrently performs clustering and dimensionality
  reduction, and can be thought of as a reduced dimension mixture of Gaussians. We
  present an exact Expectation{Maximization algorithm for tting the parameters of
  this mixture of factor analyzers.
