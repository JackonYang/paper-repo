paperAbstract: Tables are an important means for communicating information in written
  media, and understanding such tables is a challenging problem in document layout
  analysis. In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing
  the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to
  identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also
  address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based
  on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm,
  'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system
  and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general
  concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even
  other computer vision problems as well.
