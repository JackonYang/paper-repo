paperAbstract: 'In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting interest points
  invariant to scale and affine transformations. Our scale and affine invariant detectors
  are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the
  Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results
  (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated
  by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The
  affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our
  scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest
  point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian)
  is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant
  to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and
  limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant
  region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance
  by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies
  location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant
  points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large
  scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine
  an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of
  different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing
  methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching
  results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed
  on the regions associated with our points.'
