paperAbstract: The ability to act in multiple environments and transfer previous knowledge
  to new situations can be considered a critical aspect of any intelligent agent.
  Towards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that
  enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultaneously,
  and then generalize its knowledge to new domains. This method, termed "Actor-Mimic",
  exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques
  to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks
  by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations
  learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks with
  no prior expert guidance, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our
  method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games
  as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods.
