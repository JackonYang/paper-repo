paperAbstract: "In this first part of a two-part paper we introduce a general consistent\
  \ labeling problem based on a unit constraint relation T containing N-tuples of\
  \ units which constrain one another, and a compatibility relation R containing N-tuples\
  \ of unit-label pairs specifying which N-tuples of units are compatible with which\
  \ N-tuples of labels. We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations,\
  \ graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability\
  \ of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems,\
  \ are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss\
  \ the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search\
  \ required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular\
  \ look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally,\
  \ we define the \xBFKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes,\
  \ as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."
