paperAbstract: "In this paper we present a Bayesian framework for parsing images into\
  \ their constituent visual patterns. The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior\
  \ probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201Cparsing graph\u201D\
  , in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm\
  \ constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves,\
  \ which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates\
  \ two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative\
  \ (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms\
  \ of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The\
  \ latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of\
  \ bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability,\
  \ defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the\
  \ Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal\
  \ probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative\
  \ probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on\
  \ two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and\
  \ shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns\
  \ compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image\
  \ segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns\
  \ only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002.\
  \ IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural\
  \ images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be\
  \ improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation\
  \ cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual\
  \ patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."
