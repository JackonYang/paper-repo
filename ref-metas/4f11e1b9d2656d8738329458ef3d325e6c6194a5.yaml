paperAbstract: 'A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Eric Brill Supervisor:
  Mitchell Marcus One goal of computational linguistics is to discover a method for
  assigning a rich structural annotation to sentences that are presented as simple
  linear strings of words; meaning can be much more readily extracted from a structurally
  annotated sentence than from a sentence with no structural information. Also, structure
  allows for a more in-depth check of the well-formedness of a sentence. There are
  two phases to assigning these structural annotations: rst, a knowledge base is created
  and second, an algorithm is used to generate a structural annotation for a sentence
  based upon the facts provided in the knowledge base. Until recently, most knowledge
  bases were created manually by language experts. These knowledge bases are expensive
  to create and have not been used e ectively in structurally parsing sentences from
  other than highly restricted domains. The goal of this dissertation is to make signi
  cant progress toward designing automata that are able to learn some structural aspects
  of human language with little human guidance. In particular, we describe a learning
  algorithm that takes a small structurally annotated corpus of text and a larger
  unannotated corpus as input, and automatically learns how to assign accurate structural
  descriptions to sentences not in the training corpus. The main tool we use to automatically
  discover structural information about language from corpora is transformation-based
  error-driven learning. The distribution of errors produced by an imperfect annotator
  is examined to learn an ordered list of transformations that can be applied to provide
  an accurate structural annotation. We demonstrate the application of this learning
  algorithm iv to part of speech tagging and parsing. Successfully applying this technique
  to create systems that learn could lead to robust, trainable and accurate natural
  language processing systems. v'
