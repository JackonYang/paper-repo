paperAbstract: This paper describes a new algorithm for solving the N-camera stereo
  correspondence problem by transforming it into a maximum-flow problem. Once solved,
  the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the
  whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate
  and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality
  of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the
  dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show
  improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While
  the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average
  running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth
  resolution d.
