paperAbstract: 'In rather formal terms, the situation with which this paper is concerned
  may be described as follows. We are given a fixed system of n sites, labelled by
  the first n positive integers, and an associated vector x of observations, Xi, .
  . ., Xn, which, in turn, is presumed to be a realization of a vector X of (dependent)
  random variables, Xi, . . ., X.. In practice, the sites may represent points or
  regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete.
  The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of
  using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the
  sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly,
  to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly,
  where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation.'
