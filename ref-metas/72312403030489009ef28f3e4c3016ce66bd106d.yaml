paperAbstract: Within the framework of an early paper1 which considers character recognition
  as a statistical decision problem, the detailed structure of a recognition system
  can be systematically derived from the functional form of probability distributions.
  A binary matrix representation of signal is used in this paper. A nearest-neighbor
  dependence method is obtained by going beyond the usual assumption of statistical
  independence. The recognition network consists of three levels?a layer of AND gates,
  a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas
  for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios
  of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure
  of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent
  recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer.
  The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample
  characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results
  indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is
  significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric
  characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares
  favorably with other recognition schemes.
