paperAbstract: This paper presents a formulation for unsupervised learning of clusters
  reflecting multiple causal structure in binary data. Unlike the hard k-means clustering
  algorithm and the soft mixture model, each of which assumes that a single hidden
  event generates each data point, a multiple cause model accounts for observed data
  by combining assertions from many hidden causes, each of which can pertain to varying
  degree to any subset of the observable dimensions. We employ an objective function
  and iterative gradient descent learning algorithm resembling the conventional mixture
  model. A crucial issue is the mixing function for combining beliefs from different
  cluster centers in order to generate data predictions whose errors are minimized
  both during recognition and learning. The mixing function constitutes a prior assumption
  about underlying structural regularities of the data domain; we demonstrate a weakness
  inherent to the popular weighted sum followed by sigmoid squashing, and offer alternative
  forms of the nonlinearity for two types of data domain. Results are presented demonstrating
  the algorithm's ability successfully to discover coherent multiple causal representations
  in several experimental data sets.
