paperAbstract: 'TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale
  and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent
  computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the
  nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine
  across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose
  GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture
  gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server"
  designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables
  developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow
  supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep
  neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released
  it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning
  research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate
  the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.'
