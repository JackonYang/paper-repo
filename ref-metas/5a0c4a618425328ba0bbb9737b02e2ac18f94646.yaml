paperAbstract: A beginning has recently been made in recording single neurone activity
  from animals with chronically implanted electrodes (Hubel, 1957a; Gusel'nikov, 1957;
  Ricci, Doane & Jasper, 1957; Strumwasser, 1958). These methods eliminate anaesthetics,
  paralysing drugs, brain-stem lesions, and other acute experimental procedures. They
  make it possible to record electrical events in the higher central nervous system
  with the animal in a normal state, and to correlate these electrical events with
  such variables as waking state, attention, learning, and motor activity. The present
  paper describes a method for unit recording from the cortex of unanaesthetized,
  unrestrained cats, and presents some observations from the striate cortex. The objectives
  have been (1) to observe maintained unit activity under various conditions such
  as sleep and wakefulness, and (2) to find for each unit the natural stimuli which
  most effectively influence firing. Of 400 units observed, some 200 are presented
  here because of their common characteristics. Since there is reason to believe that
  the remainiing 200 units were afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus,
  these will be described in a separate paper. A preliminary account of some of this
  work has been given elsewhere (Hubel, 1958).
