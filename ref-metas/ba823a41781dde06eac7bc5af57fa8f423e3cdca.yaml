paperAbstract: A syntactic rule learning method is presented for analyzing document
  images and constructing a database from them. This method is used in a digital library
  system named CyberMagazine, where document images are sequentially converted into
  database tuples by block segmentation, rough classification, and syntactic analysis.
  The syntactic rule has an ability to analyze symbols located in two dimensional
  plane, and has a syntax similar to an ordinal context free grammar except for the
  concatenation of symbols. In the presented learning method, the syntactic rules
  are generated from a set of parse trees by decomposing the trees according to non
  terminal symbols, generalizing the decomposed trees to a syntactic rule, and merging
  them.
