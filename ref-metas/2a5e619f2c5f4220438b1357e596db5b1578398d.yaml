paperAbstract: We describe a parsing system based upon a language model for English
  that is, in turn, based upon assigning probabilities to possible parses for a sentence.
  This model is used in a parsing system by finding the parse for the sentence with
  the highest probability. This system outperforms previous schemes. As this is the
  third in a series of parsers by different authors that are similar enough to invite
  detailed comparisons but different enough to give rise to different levels of performance,
  we also report on some experiments designed to identify what aspects of these systems
  best explain their relative performance.
