paperAbstract: We propose NEIL (Never Ending Image Learner), a computer program that
  runs 24 hours per day and 7 days per week to automatically extract visual knowledge
  from Internet data. NEIL uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm that jointly
  discovers common sense relationships (e.g., "Corolla is a kind of/looks similar
  to Car", "Wheel is a part of Car") and labels instances of the given visual categories.
  It is an attempt to develop the world's largest visual structured knowledge base
  with minimum human labeling effort. As of 10th October 2013, NEIL has been continuously
  running for 2.5 months on 200 core cluster (more than 350K CPU hours) and has an
  ontology of 1152 object categories, 1034 scene categories and 87 attributes. During
  this period, NEIL has discovered more than 1700 relationships and has labeled more
  than 400K visual instances.
