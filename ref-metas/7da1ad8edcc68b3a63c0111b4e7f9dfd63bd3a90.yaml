paperAbstract: There has been a growing interest in exploiting contextual information
  in addition to local features to detect and localize multiple object categories
  in an image. Context models can efficiently rule out some unlikely combinations
  or locations of objects and guide detectors to produce a semantically coherent interpretation
  of a scene. However, the performance benefit from using context models has been
  limited because most of these methods were tested on datasets with only a few object
  categories, in which most images contain only one or two object categories. In this
  paper, we introduce a new dataset with images that contain many instances of different
  object categories and propose an efficient model that captures the contextual information
  among more than a hundred of object categories. We show that our context model can
  be applied to scene understanding tasks that local detectors alone cannot solve.
