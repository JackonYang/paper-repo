paperAbstract: The ICDAR 2019 Challenge on "Scanned receipts OCR and key information
  extraction" (SROIE) covers important aspects related to the automated analysis of
  scanned receipts. The SROIE tasks play a key role in many document analysis systems
  and hold significant commercial potential. Although a lot of work has been published
  over the years on administrative document analysis, the community has advanced relatively
  slowly, as most datasets have been kept private. One of the key contributions of
  SROIE to the document analysis community is to offer a first, standardized dataset
  of 1000 whole scanned receipt images and annotations, as well as an evaluation procedure
  for such tasks. The Challenge is structured around three tasks, namely Scanned Receipt
  Text Localization (Task 1), Scanned Receipt OCR (Task 2) and Key Information Extraction
  from Scanned Receipts (Task 3). The competition opened on 10th February, 2019 and
  closed on 5th May, 2019. We received 29, 24 and 18 valid submissions received for
  the three competition tasks, respectively. This report presents the competition
  datasets, define the tasks and the evaluation protocols, offer detailed submission
  statistics, as well as an analysis of the submitted performance. While the tasks
  of text localization and recognition seem to be relatively easy to tackle, it is
  interesting to observe the variety of ideas and approaches proposed for the information
  extraction task. According to the submissions' performance we believe there is still
  margin for improving information extraction performance, although the current dataset
  would have to grow substantially in following editions. Given the success of the
  SROIE competition evidenced by the wide interest generated and the healthy number
  of submissions from academic, research institutes and industry over different countries,
  we consider that the SROIE competition can evolve into a useful resource for the
  community, drawing further attention and promoting research and development efforts
  in this field.
