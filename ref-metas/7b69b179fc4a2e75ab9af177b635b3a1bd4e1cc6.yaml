paperAbstract: The growth in digital camera usage combined with a worldly abundance
  of text has translated to a rich new era for a classic problem of pattern recognition,
  reading. While traditional document processing often faces challenges such as unusual
  fonts, noise, and unconstrained lexicons, scene text reading amplifies these challenges
  and introduces new ones such as motion blur, curved layouts, perspective projection,
  and occlusion among others. Reading scene text is a complex problem involving many
  details that must be handled effectively for robust, accurate results. In this work,
  we describe and evaluate a reading system that combines several pieces, using probabilistic
  methods for coarsely binarizing a given text region, identifying baselines, and
  jointly performing word and character segmentation during the recognition process.
  By using scene context to recognize several words together in a line of text, our
  system gives state-of-the-art performance on three difficult benchmark data sets.
