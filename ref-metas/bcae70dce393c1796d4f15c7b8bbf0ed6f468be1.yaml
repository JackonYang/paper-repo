paperAbstract: The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (or SIFT) algorithm is a highly
  robust method to extract and consequently match distinctive invariant features from
  images. These features can then be used to reliably match objects in diering images.
  The algorithm was rst proposed by Lowe [12] and further developed to increase performance
  resulting in the classic paper [13] that served as foundation for SIFT which has
  played an important role in robotic and machine vision in the past decade.
