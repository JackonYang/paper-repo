paperAbstract: 'Abstract : This report describes work performed on two aspects of
  the scene analysis process. These are segmentation, and the treatment of occlusions,
  shadows, and highlights. The eventual goal of the research is the formulation of
  knowledge sources which play an important role in a model for a general vision system.
  The model is based on the hypothesize-and-test paradigm and consists of a number
  of independent knowledge sources which cooperate through a global data base.'
