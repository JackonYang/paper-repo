paperAbstract: 'The notion of stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (SLTAG)
  is formally defined. The parameters of a SLTAG correspond to the probability of
  combining two structures each one associated with a word. The characteristics of
  SLTAG are unique and novel since it is lexieally sensitive (as N-gram models or
  Hidden Markov Models) and yet hierarchical (as stochastic context-free grammars).Then,
  two basic algorithms for SLTAG arc introduced: an algorithm for computing the probability
  of a sentence generated by a SLTAG and an inside-outside-like iterative algorithm
  for estimating the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus.Finally, we should
  how SLTAG enables to define a lexicalized version of stochastic context-free grammars
  and we report preliminary experiments showing some of the advantages of SLTAG over
  stochastic context-free grammars.'
