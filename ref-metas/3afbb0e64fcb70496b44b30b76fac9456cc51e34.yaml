paperAbstract: Feature trajectories have shown to be efficient for representing videos.
  Typically, they are extracted using the KLT tracker or matching SIFT descriptors
  between frames. However, the quality as well as quantity of these trajectories is
  often not sufficient. Inspired by the recent success of dense sampling in image
  classification, we propose an approach to describe videos by dense trajectories.
  We sample dense points from each frame and track them based on displacement information
  from a dense optical flow field. Given a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm,
  our trajectories are robust to fast irregular motions as well as shot boundaries.
  Additionally, dense trajectories cover the motion information in videos well. We,
  also, investigate how to design descriptors to encode the trajectory information.
  We introduce a novel descriptor based on motion boundary histograms, which is robust
  to camera motion. This descriptor consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
  descriptors, in particular in uncontrolled realistic videos. We evaluate our video
  description in the context of action classification with a bag-of-features approach.
  Experimental results show a significant improvement over the state of the art on
  four datasets of varying difficulty, i.e. KTH, YouTube, Hollywood2 and UCF sports.
