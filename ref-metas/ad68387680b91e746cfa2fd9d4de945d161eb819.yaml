paperAbstract: This paper presents a framework for fusing together global and local
  information in images to form a powerful object detection system. We begin by describing
  two detection algorithms. The first algorithm uses independent component analysis
  to derive an image representation that captures global information in the input
  data. The second algorithm uses a part-based representation that relies on local
  properties of the data. The strengths of the two detection algorithms are then combined
  to form a more powerful detector The approach is evaluated on a database of real-world
  images containing side views of cars. The combined detector gives distinctly superior
  performance than each of the individual detectors, achieving a high detection accuracy
  of 94% on this difficult test set.
