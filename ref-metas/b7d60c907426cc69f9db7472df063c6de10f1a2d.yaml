paperAbstract: Image understanding involves analyzing many different aspects of the
  scene. In this paper, we are concerned with how these tasks can be combined in a
  way that improves the performance of each of them. Inspired by Barrow and Tenenbaum,
  we present a flexible framework for interfacing scene analysis processes using intrinsic
  images. Each intrinsic image is a registered map describing one characteristic of
  the scene. We apply this framework to develop an integrated 3D scene understanding
  system with estimates of surface orientations, occlusion boundaries, objects, camera
  viewpoint, and relative depth. Our experiments on a set of 300 outdoor images demonstrate
  that these tasks reinforce each other, and we illustrate a coherent scene understanding
  with automatically reconstructed 3D models.
