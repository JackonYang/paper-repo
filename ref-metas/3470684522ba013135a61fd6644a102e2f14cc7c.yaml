paperAbstract: In this work, we jointly address the problem of text detection and
  recognition in natural scene images based on convolutional recurrent neural networks.
  We propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and recognizes text with
  a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes, such as image cropping,
  feature re-calculation, word separation, and character grouping. In contrast to
  existing approaches that consider text detection and recognition as two distinct
  tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed framework settles these two tasks
  concurrently. The whole framework can be trained end-to-end, requiring only images,
  ground-truth bounding boxes and text labels. The convolutional features are calculated
  only once and shared by both detection and recognition, which saves processing time.
  Through multi-task training, the learned features become more informative and improves
  the overall performance. Our proposed method has achieved competitive performance
  on several benchmark datasets.
