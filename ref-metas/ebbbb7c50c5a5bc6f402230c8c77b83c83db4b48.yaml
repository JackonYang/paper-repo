paperAbstract: Segmentation of document images can be performed by projecting image
  pixels. This pixel projection approach is one of widely used top-down segmentation
  methods and is based on the assumption that the document image has been correctly
  deskewed. Unfortunately, the pixel projection approach is computationally inefficient.
  It is because each symbol is not treated as a computational unit. In this paper,
  we explain a new technique which is highly tactical in the profiling analysis. Instead
  of projecting image pixels, we first compute the bounding box of each connected
  component in a document image and then we project those bounding boxes. Using the
  new technique, this paper describes how to extract words, text lines, and text blocks
  (e.g., paragraphs). This bounding box projection approach has many advantages over
  the pixel projection approach. It is less computationally involved. When applied
  to text zones, it is also possible to infer from the projection profiles how bounding
  boxes (and, therefore, primitive symbols) are aligned and/or where significant horizontal
  and vertical gaps are present. Since the new technique manipulates only bounding
  boxes, it can be applied to any noncursive language documents.
