paperAbstract: The nearestor near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety
  of database applications, usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late,
  there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing
  similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections,
  time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques
  for solving this problem fall prey to the \curse of dimensionality." That is, the
  data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of
  dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves
  the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than
  brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features
  and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic,
  determining an approximate nearest neighbor should su ce for most practical purposes.
  In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based
  on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points Supported by NAVY N00014-96-1-1221

  to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are
  close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence
  that our method gives signi cant improvement in running time over other methods
  for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition.
  Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively
  large number of dimensions (more than 50).
