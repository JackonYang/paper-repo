paperAbstract: Research aimed at correcting words in text has focused on three progressively
  more difficult problems:(1) nonword error detection; (2) isolated-word error correction;
  and (3) context-dependent work correction. In response to the first problem, efficient
  pattern-matching and n-gram analysis techniques have been developed for detecting
  strings that do not appear in a given word list. In response to the second problem,
  a variety of general and application-specific spelling correction techniques have
  been developed. Some of them were based on detailed studies of spelling error patterns.
  In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing
  tools or statistical-language models have been carried out. This article surveys
  documented findings on spelling error patterns, provides descriptions of various
  nonword detection and isolated-word error correction techniques, reviews the state
  of the art of context-dependent word correction techniques, and discusses research
  issues related to all three areas of automatic error correction in text.
