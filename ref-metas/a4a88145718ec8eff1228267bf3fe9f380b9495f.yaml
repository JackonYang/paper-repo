paperAbstract: "\n \n Most state-of-the-art scene text detection algorithms are deep\
  \ learning based methods that depend on bounding box regression and perform at least\
  \ two kinds of predictions: text/non-text classification and location regression.\
  \ Regression plays a key role in the acquisition of bounding boxes in these methods,\
  \ but it is not indispensable because text/non-text prediction can also be considered\
  \ as a kind of semantic segmentation that contains full location information in\
  \ itself. However, text instances in scene images often lie very close to each other,\
  \ making them very difficult to separate via semantic segmentation. Therefore, instance\
  \ segmentation is needed to address this problem. In this paper, PixelLink, a novel\
  \ scene text detection algorithm based on instance segmentation, is proposed. Text\
  \ instances are first segmented out by linking pixels within the same instance together.\
  \ Text bounding boxes are then extracted directly from the segmentation result without\
  \ location regression. Experiments show that, compared with regression-based methods,\
  \ PixelLink can achieve better or comparable performance on several benchmarks,\
  \ while requiring many fewer training iterations and less training data.\n \n"
