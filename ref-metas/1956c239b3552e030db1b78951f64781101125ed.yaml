paperAbstract: "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translation\
  \ that has shown promising results that are comparable to traditional approaches.\
  \ A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly\
  \ translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies\
  \ with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV)\
  \ word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address\
  \ this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of\
  \ a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word\
  \ in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence.\
  \ This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every\
  \ OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT\u201914 English to French\
  \ translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up\
  \ to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.\
  \ With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result\
  \ achieved on a WMT\u201914 contest task."
