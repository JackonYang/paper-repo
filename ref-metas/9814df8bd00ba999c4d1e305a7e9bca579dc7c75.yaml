paperAbstract: The ability to associate images with natural language sentences that
  describe what is depicted in them is a hallmark of image understanding, and a prerequisite
  for applications such as sentence-based image search. In analogy to image search,
  we propose to frame sentence-based image annotation as the task of ranking a given
  pool of captions. We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image
  description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five
  different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and
  events. We introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task, even
  though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision.
  Our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per
  image, and of capturing syntactic (word order-based) and semantic features of these
  captions. We also perform an in-depth comparison of human and automatic evaluation
  metrics for this task, and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply
  and on a very large scale, allowing us to augment our collection with additional
  relevance judgments of which captions describe which image. Our analysis shows that
  metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence
  are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per
  query. Moreover, our study suggests that the evaluation of ranking-based image description
  systems may be fully automated.
