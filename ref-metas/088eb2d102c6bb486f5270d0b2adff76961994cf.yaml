paperAbstract: We present an example-based learning approach for locating vertical
  frontal views of human faces in complex scenes. The technique models the distribution
  of human face patterns by means of a few view-based "face" and "nonface" model clusters.
  At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local
  image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines,
  based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face
  exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric
  we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the "nonface" clusters we
  include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our
  system.
