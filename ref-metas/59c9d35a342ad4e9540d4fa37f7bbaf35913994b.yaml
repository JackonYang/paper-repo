paperAbstract: The appeal of computer games may be enhanced by vision-based user inputs.
  The high speed and low cost requirements for near-term, mass-market game applications
  make system design challenging. The response time of the vision interface should
  be less than a video frame time and the interface should cost less than $50 U.S.
  We meet these constraints with algorithms tailored to particular hardware. We have
  developed a special detector, called the artificial retina chip, which allows for
  fast, on-chip image processing. We describe two algorithms, based on image moments
  and orientation histograms, which exploit the capabilities of the chip to provide
  interactive response to the player's hand or body positions at 10 msec frame time
  and at low-cost. We show several possible game interactions.
