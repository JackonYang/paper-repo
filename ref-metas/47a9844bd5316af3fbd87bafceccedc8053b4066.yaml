paperAbstract: Managing the buffering of data along arcs is a critical part of compiling
  a synchronous dataflow (SDF) program. This paper shows how dataflow properties can
  be analyzed at compile-time to make buffering more efficient. Since the target code
  corresponding to each node of an SDF graph is normally obtained from a hand-optimized
  library of predefined blocks, the efficiency of data transfer between blocks is
  often the limiting factor in how closely an SDF compiler can approximate meticulous
  manual coding. Furthermore, in the presence of large sample-rate changes, straightforward
  buffering techniques can quickly exhaust limited on-chip data memory, necessitating
  the use of slower external memory. The techniques presented in this paper address
  both of these problems in a unified manner.
