paperAbstract: 'Cascades are a popular framework to speed up object detection systems.
  Here we focus on the first layers of a category independent object detection cascade
  in which we sample a large number of windows from an objectness prior, and then
  discriminatively learn to filter these candidate windows by an order of magnitude.
  We make a number of contributions to cascade design that substantially improve over
  the state of the art: (i) our novel objectness prior gives much higher recall than
  competing methods, (ii) we propose objectness features that give high performance
  with very low computational cost, and (iii) we make use of a structured output ranking
  approach to learn highly effective, but inexpensive linear feature combinations
  by directly optimizing cascade performance. Thorough evaluation on the PASCAL VOC
  data set shows consistent improvement over the current state of the art, and over
  alternative discriminative learning strategies.'
