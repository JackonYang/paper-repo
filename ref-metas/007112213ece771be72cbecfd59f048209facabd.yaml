paperAbstract: 'Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent
  behavior, but has proven difficult for neural networks to learn. In this paper we
  describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to
  solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented
  networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called
  CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based
  question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic
  physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that
  powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational
  questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Our work shows how
  a deep learning architecture equipped with an RN module can implicitly discover
  and learn to reason about entities and their relations.'
