paperAbstract: The continuous development of object detection algorithms is ushering
  in the need for evaluation tools to quantify algorithm performance. In this paper
  a set of seven metrics are proposed for quantifying different aspects of a detection
  algorithm's performance. The strengths and weaknesses of these metrics are described.
  They are implemented in the Video Performance Evaluation Resource (ViPER) system
  and will be used to evaluate algorithms for detecting text, faces, moving people
  and vehicles. Results for running two previous text-detection algorithms on a common
  data set are presented.
