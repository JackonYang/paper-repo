paperAbstract: Hidden Markov model speech recognition systems typically use Gaussian
  mixture models to estimate the distributions of decorrelated acoustic feature vectors
  that correspond to individual subword units. By contrast, hybrid connectionist-HMM
  systems use discriminatively-trained neural networks to estimate the probability
  distribution among subword units given the acoustic observations. In this work we
  show a large improvement in word recognition performance by combining neural-net
  discriminative feature processing with Gaussian-mixture distribution modeling. By
  training the network to generate the subword probability posteriors, then using
  transformations of these estimates as the base features for a conventionally-trained
  Gaussian-mixture based system, we achieve relative error rate reductions of 35%
  or more on the multicondition Aurora noisy continuous digits task.
