paperAbstract: Although Bayesian analysis has been in use since Laplace, the Bayesian
  method of model-comparison has only recently been developed in depth. In this paper,
  the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by
  studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods
  described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems.
  Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution.
  Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared
  by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by
  this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants
  and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number
  of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling.
