paperAbstract: Humans appear to be able to learn new concepts without needing to be
  programmed explicitly in any conventional sense. In this paper we regard learning
  as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming.
  We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational
  viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism,
  the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using
  it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic
  complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so
  learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic
  learning systems.
