paperAbstract: 'An optical character recognition (OCR) engine that is omnifont and
  reasonably robust on individual degraded characters is presented. The weakest link
  is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided
  into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document
  analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation.
  The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features
  and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs
  of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so
  that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of
  the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy
  the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays ''pop-up''
  images of uncertain characters. >'
