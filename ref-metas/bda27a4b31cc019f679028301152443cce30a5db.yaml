paperAbstract: Simple cells in the striate cortex have been depicted as half-wave-rectified
  linear operators. Complex cells have been depicted as energy mechanisms, constructed
  from the squared sum of the outputs of quadrature pairs of linear operators. However,
  the linear/energy model falls short of a complete explanation of striate cell responses.
  In this paper, a modified version of the linear/energy model is presented in which
  striate cells mutually inhibit one another, effectively normalizing their responses
  with respect to stimulus contrast. This paper reviews experimental measurements
  of striate cell responses, and shows that the new model explains a significantly
  larger body of physiological data.
