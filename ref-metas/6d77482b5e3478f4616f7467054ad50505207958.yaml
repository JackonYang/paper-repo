paperAbstract: As massively parallel computations have become broadly available with
  modern GPUs, deep architectures trained on very large datasets have risen in popularity.
  Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently
  shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classification
  benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar
  to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper,
  we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the state-of-the-art
  Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture
  significantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results
  with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid
  architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted
  image classification pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional
  networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination
  further improves the accuracy.
