paperAbstract: Image captioning is a challenging task where the machine automatically
  describes an image by sentences or phrases. It often requires a large number of
  paired image-sentence annotations for training. However, a pre-trained captioning
  model can hardly be applied to a new domain in which some novel object categories
  exist, i.e., the objects and their description words are unseen during model training.
  To correctly caption the novel object, it requires professional human workers to
  annotate the images by sentences with the novel words. It is labor expensive and
  thus limits its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the
  zero-shot novel object captioning task where the machine generates descriptions
  without extra training sentences about the novel object. To tackle the challenging
  problem, we propose a Decoupled Novel Object Captioner (DNOC) framework that can
  fully decouple the language sequence model from the object descriptions. DNOC has
  two components. 1) A Sequence Model with the Placeholder (SM-P) generates a sentence
  containing placeholders. The placeholder represents an unseen novel object. Thus,
  the sequence model can be decoupled from the novel object descriptions. 2) A key-value
  object memory built upon the freely available detection model, contains the visual
  information and the corresponding word for each object. A query generated from the
  SM-P is used to retrieve the words from the object memory. The placeholder will
  further be filled with the correct word, resulting in a caption with novel object
  descriptions. The experimental results on the held-out MSCOCO dataset demonstrate
  the ability of DNOC in describing novel concepts.
