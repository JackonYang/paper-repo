paperAbstract: Two experiments that strongly suggest that largely distributional techniques
  might be developed to automatically provide both a set of part of speech tags for
  English and a skeletal parsing of free English text are described. In one experiment
  the authors have developed a constituent boundary parsing algorithm that derives
  an (unlabeled) bracketing, given text annotated for part of speech as input. In
  other experiment the authors have investigated whether a distributional analysis
  can discover a part of speech tag set which might prove adequate to support experiments.
  The state of a tagged natural language corpus to aid such experiments is summarized.<<ETX>>
