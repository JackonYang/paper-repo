paperAbstract: Full end-to-end text recognition in natural images is a challenging
  problem that has received much attention recently. Traditional systems in this area
  have relied on elaborate models incorporating carefully hand-engineered features
  or large amounts of prior knowledge. In this paper, we take a different route and
  combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together
  with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use
  a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer
  modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules
  into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and
  ICDAR 2003.
