paperAbstract: "The web is overflowing with implicitly structured data, spread over\
  \ hundreds of thousands of sites, hidden deep behind search forms, or siloed in\
  \ marketplaces, only accessible as HTML. Automatic extraction of structured data\
  \ at the scale of thousands of websites has long proven elusive, despite its central\
  \ role in the \"web of data\". \n \nThrough an extensive evaluation spanning over\
  \ 10000 web sites from multiple application domains, we show that automatic, yet\
  \ accurate full-site extraction is no longer a distant dream. diadem is the first\
  \ automatic full-site extraction system that is able to extract structured data\
  \ from different domains at very high accuracy. It combines automated exploration\
  \ of websites, identification of relevant data, and induction of exhaustive wrappers.\
  \ Automating these components is the first challenge. diadem overcomes this challenge\
  \ by combining phenomenological and ontological knowledge. Integrating these components\
  \ is the second challenge. diadem overcomes this challenge through a self-adaptive\
  \ network of relational transducers that produces effective wrappers for a wide\
  \ variety of websites. \n \nOur extensive and publicly available evaluation shows\
  \ that, for more than 90% of sites from three domains, diadem obtains an effective\
  \ wrapper that extracts all relevant data with 97% average precision. diadem also\
  \ tolerates noisy entity recognisers, and its components individually outperform\
  \ comparable approaches."
