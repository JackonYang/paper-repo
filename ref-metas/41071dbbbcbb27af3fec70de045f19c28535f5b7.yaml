paperAbstract: Adversarial attacks to image classification systems present challenges
  to convolutional networks and opportunities for understanding them. This study suggests
  that adversarial perturbations on images lead to noise in the features constructed
  by these networks. Motivated by this observation, we develop new network architectures
  that increase adversarial robustness by performing feature denoising. Specifically,
  our networks contain blocks that denoise the features using non-local means or other
  filters; the entire networks are trained end-to-end. When combined with adversarial
  training, our feature denoising networks substantially improve the state-of-the-art
  in adversarial robustness in both white-box and black-box attack settings. On ImageNet,
  under 10-iteration PGD white-box attacks where prior art has 27.9% accuracy, our
  method achieves 55.7%; even under extreme 2000-iteration PGD white-box attacks,
  our method secures 42.6% accuracy. Our method was ranked first in Competition on
  Adversarial Attacks and Defenses (CAAD) 2018 --- it achieved 50.6% classification
  accuracy on a secret, ImageNet-like test dataset against 48 unknown attackers, surpassing
  the runner-up approach by ~10%. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageNet-Adversarial-Training.
