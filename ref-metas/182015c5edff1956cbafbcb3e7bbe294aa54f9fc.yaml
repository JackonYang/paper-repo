paperAbstract: 'Recent deep learning and unsupervised feature learning systems that
  learn from unlabeled data have achieved high performance in benchmarks by using
  extremely large architectures with many features (hidden units) at each layer. Unfortunately,
  for such large architectures the number of parameters can grow quadratically in
  the width of the network, thus necessitating hand-coded "local receptive fields"
  that limit the number of connections from lower level features to higher ones (e.g.,
  based on spatial locality). In this paper we propose a fast method to choose these
  connections that may be incorporated into a wide variety of unsupervised training
  methods. Specifically, we choose local receptive fields that group together those
  low-level features that are most similar to each other according to a pairwise similarity
  metric. This approach allows us to harness the advantages of local receptive fields
  (such as improved scalability, and reduced data requirements) when we do not know
  how to specify such receptive fields by hand or where our unsupervised training
  algorithm has no obvious generalization to a topographic setting. We produce results
  showing how this method allows us to use even simple unsupervised training algorithms
  to train successful multi-layered networks that achieve state-of-the-art results
  on CIFAR and STL datasets: 82.0% and 60.1% accuracy, respectively.'
