paperAbstract: We apply a Bayesian method for inferring an optimal basis to the problem
  of finding efficient image codes for natural scenes. The basis functions learned
  by the algorithm are oriented and localized in both space and frequency, bearing
  a resemblance to two-dimensional Gabor functions, and increasing the number of basis
  functions results in a greater sampling density in position, orientation, and scale.
  These properties also resemble the spatial receptive fields of neurons in the primary
  visual cortex of mammals, suggesting that the receptive-field structure of these
  neurons can be accounted for by a general efficient coding principle. The probabilistic
  framework provides a method for comparing the coding efficiency of different bases
  objectively by calculating their probability given the observed data or by measuring
  the entropy of the basis function coefficients. The learned bases are shown to have
  better coding efficiency than traditional Fourier and wavelet bases. This framework
  also provides a Bayesian solution to the problems of image denoising and filling
  in of missing pixels. We demonstrate that the results obtained by applying the learned
  bases to these problems are improved over those obtained with traditional techniques.
