paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we present a new approach for text localization in
  natural images, by discriminating text and non-text regions at three levels: pixel,
  component and text line levels. Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the
  Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke
  Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly
  enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection.
  Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component
  classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating
  the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches. The two
  classifiers are built upon two novel Text Covariance Descriptors (TCDs) that encode
  both the heuristic properties and the statistical characteristics of text stokes.
  Finally, text regions are located by simply thresholding the text-line confident
  map. Our method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ICDAR 2005 and ICDAR 2011,
  and the corresponding F-measure values are 0.72 and 0.73, respectively, surpassing
  previous methods in accuracy by a large margin.'
