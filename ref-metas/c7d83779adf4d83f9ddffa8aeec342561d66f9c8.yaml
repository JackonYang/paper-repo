paperAbstract: "1. Cells in visual cortex have been alternately considered as bar\
  \ and edge detectors, or as spatial\u2010frequency filters responding to the two\u2010\
  dimensional Fourier component of patterns. 2. The responses to gratings and to checkerboards\
  \ allow one to test these alternate models: the Fourier components of a checkerboard\
  \ pattern do not occur at the same orientation as the edges, nor do the checkerboard\
  \ spatial frequencies correspond to the check widths. 3. Knowing the orientation\
  \ tuning of a cell for gratings, one can precisely predict its orientation tuning\
  \ to checkerboards from the orientation of the fundamental Fourier components of\
  \ the patterns, not from the orientation of their edges. This was found for both\
  \ square and rectangular checkerboards, and held for both simple and complex cortical\
  \ cells. 4. Knowing the spatial tuning of a cell for sine\u2010wave gratings, one\
  \ can precisely predict its spatial tuning to square and rectangular checkerboards\
  \ from the spatial frequencies of the fundamental Fourier components of the patterns,\
  \ not from the widths of their checks. 5. When presented with checkerboards in which\
  \ not the fundamental but the upper harmonics were within its spatial bandpass,\
  \ a cell's orientation tuning was found to be predictable from the (quite different)\
  \ orientation of the higher Fourier harmonic components, but not from the orientation\
  \ of the edges. 6. Knowing a cell's contrast sensitivity for gratings, one can predict\
  \ the cell's contrast sensitivity for checkerboards much more accurately from the\
  \ amplitudes of the two\u2010dimensional Fourier components of the patterns than\
  \ from the contrasts of the patterns. 7. The orientation tuning, spatial\u2010frequency\
  \ tuning and responsiveness of cells to a plaid pattern were also found to be predictable\
  \ from the pattern's two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum. 8. Both simple and complex\
  \ striate cortex cells can thus be characterized as two\u2010dimensional spatial\u2010\
  frequency filters. Since different cells responsive to the same region in the visual\
  \ field are tuned to different spatial frequencies and orientations, the ensemble\
  \ of such cells would fairly precisely encode the two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum\
  \ of a patch of visual space."
