paperAbstract: We describe the functional and architectural breakdown of a monocular
  pedestrian detection system. We describe in detail our approach for single-frame
  classification based on a novel scheme of breaking down the class variability by
  repeatedly training a set of relatively simple classifiers on clusters of the training
  set. Single-frame classification performance results and system level performance
  figures for daytime conditions are presented with a discussion about the remaining
  gap to meet a daytime normal weather condition production system.
