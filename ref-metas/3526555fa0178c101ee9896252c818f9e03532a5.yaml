paperAbstract: 'We present an exhaustive investigation of recent Deep Learning architectures,
  algorithms, and strategies for the task of document image classification to finally
  reduce the error by more than half. Existing approaches, such as the DeepDoc-Classifier,
  apply standard Convolutional Network architectures with transfer learning from the
  object recognition domain. The contribution of the paper is threefold: First, it
  investigates recently introduced very deep neural network architectures (GoogLeNet,
  VGG, ResNet) using transfer learning (from real images). Second, it proposes transfer
  learning from a huge set of document images, i.e. 400; 000 documents. Third, it
  analyzes the impact of the amount of training data (document images) and other parameters
  to the classification abilities. We use two datasets, the Tobacco-3482 and the large-scale
  RVL-CDIP dataset. We achieve an accuracy of 91:13% for the Tobacco-3482 dataset
  while earlier approaches reach only 77:6%. Thus, a relative error reduction of more
  than 60% is achieved. For the large dataset RVL-CDIP, an accuracy of 90:97% is achieved,
  corresponding to a relative error reduction of 11:5%.'
