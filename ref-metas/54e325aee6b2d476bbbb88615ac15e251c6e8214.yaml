paperAbstract: "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an\
  \ adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative\
  \ model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that\
  \ estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than\
  \ G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake.\
  \ This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary\
  \ functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data\
  \ distribution and D equal to \xBD everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined\
  \ by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.\
  \ There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks\
  \ during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential\
  \ of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated\
  \ samples."
