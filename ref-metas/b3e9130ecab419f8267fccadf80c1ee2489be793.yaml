paperAbstract: Semantic knowledge can be a great asset to natural language processing
  systems, but it is usually hand-coded for each application. Although some semantic
  information is available in general-purpose knowledge bases such as WordNet and
  Cyc, many applications require domain-specific lexicons that represent words and
  categories for a particular topic. In this paper, we present a corpus-based method
  that can be used to build semantic lexicons for specific categories. The input to
  the system is a small set of seed words for a category and a representative text
  corpus. The output is a ranked list of words that are associated with the category.
  A user then reviews the top-ranked words and decides which ones should be entered
  in the semantic lexicon. In experiments with five categories, users typically found
  about 60 words per category in 10-15 minutes to build a core semantic lexicon.
