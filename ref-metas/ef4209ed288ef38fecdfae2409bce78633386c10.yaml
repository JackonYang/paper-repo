paperAbstract: We propose a first attempt to classify events in static images by integrating
  scene and object categorizations. We define an event in a static image as a human
  activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number
  of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate
  event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as
  to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within
  the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event
  as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical
  objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative
  and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled
  a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our
  system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each
  component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects
  alone cannot achieve this performance.
