paperAbstract: In this paper we present a computationally efficient framework for
  part-based modeling and recognition of objects. Our work is motivated by the pictorial
  structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent
  an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance
  of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented
  by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative
  descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems.
  We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of
  an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training
  examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques
  by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting
  models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images.
