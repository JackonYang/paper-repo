paperAbstract: 'Abstract : As a result of this grant, the researchers have now published
  oil CDROM a corpus of over 4 million words of running text annotated with part-of-
  speech (POS) tags, with over 3 million words of that material assigned skeletal
  grammatical structure. This material now includes a fully hand-parsed version of
  the classic Brown corpus. About one half of the papers at the ACL Workshop on Using
  Large Text Corpora this past summer were based on the materials generated by this
  grant.'
