paperAbstract: We seek to both detect and segment objects in images. To exploit both
  local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random
  Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence
  of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling
  graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels
  are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from
  large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference. We show
  how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance,
  both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply
  our system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes.
