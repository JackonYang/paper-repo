paperAbstract: Scene text detection and segmentation are two important and challenging
  research problems in the field of computer vision. This paper proposes a novel method
  for scene text detection and segmentation based on cascaded convolution neural networks
  (CNNs). In this method, a CNN-based text-aware candidate text region (CTR) extraction
  model (named detection network, DNet) is designed and trained using both the edges
  and the whole regions of text, with which coarse CTRs are detected. A CNN-based
  CTR refinement model (named segmentation network, SNet) is then constructed to precisely
  segment the coarse CTRs into text to get the refined CTRs. With DNet and SNet, much
  fewer CTRs are extracted than with traditional approaches while more true text regions
  are kept. The refined CTRs are finally classified using a CNN-based CTR classification
  model (named classification network, CNet) to get the final text regions. All of
  these CNN-based models are modified from VGGNet-16. Extensive experiments on three
  benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art
  performance and greatly outperforms other scene text detection and segmentation
  approaches.
