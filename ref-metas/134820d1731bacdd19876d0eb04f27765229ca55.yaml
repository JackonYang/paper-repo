paperAbstract: 'This paper presents an effective approach for the offline recognition
  of unconstrained handwritten Chinese texts. Under the general integrated segmentation-and-recognition
  framework with character oversegmentation, we investigate three important issues:
  candidate path evaluation, path search, and parameter estimation. For path evaluation,
  we combine multiple contexts (character recognition scores, geometric and linguistic
  contexts) from the Bayesian decision view, and convert the classifier outputs to
  posterior probabilities via confidence transformation. In path search, we use a
  refined beam search algorithm to improve the search efficiency and, meanwhile, use
  a candidate character augmentation strategy to improve the recognition accuracy.
  The combining weights of the path evaluation function are optimized by supervised
  learning using a Maximum Character Accuracy criterion. We evaluated the recognition
  performance on a Chinese handwriting database CASIA-HWDB, which contains nearly
  four million character samples of 7,356 classes and 5,091 pages of unconstrained
  handwritten texts. The experimental results show that confidence transformation
  and combining multiple contexts improve the text line recognition performance significantly.
  On a test set of 1,015 handwritten pages, the proposed approach achieved character-level
  accurate rate of 90.75 percent and correct rate of 91.39 percent, which are superior
  by far to the best results reported in the literature.'
