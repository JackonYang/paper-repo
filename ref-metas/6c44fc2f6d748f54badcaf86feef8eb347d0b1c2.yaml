paperAbstract: Text presented in videos provides important supplemental information
  for video indexing and retrieval. Many efforts have been made for text detection
  in videos. However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for
  video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance
  evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a
  positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate
  the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the
  detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level
  to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with
  respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth
  difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value
  to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average
  of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection
  rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation
  scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to
  determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol
  has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems.
  Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance
  of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve,
  select, and design new text detection methods.
