paperAbstract: Multiresolution representations are effective for analyzing the information
  content of images. The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at
  a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information
  between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/
  (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet
  orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable
  n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family
  of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x).
  This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a
  wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions
  with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial
  and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several
  spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression
  in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >
