paperAbstract: We consider the scene text recognition problem under the attention-based
  encoder-decoder framework, which is the state of the art. The existing methods usually
  employ a frame-wise maximal likelihood loss to optimize the models. When we train
  the model, the misalignment between the ground truth strings and the attention's
  output sequences of probability distribution, which is caused by missing or superfluous
  characters, will confuse and mislead the training process, and consequently make
  the training costly and degrade the recognition accuracy. To handle this problem,
  we propose a novel method called edit probability (EP) for scene text recognition.
  EP tries to effectively estimate the probability of generating a string from the
  output sequence of probability distribution conditioned on the input image, while
  considering the possible occurrences of missing/superfluous characters. The advantage
  lies in that the training process can focus on the missing, superfluous and unrecognized
  characters, and thus the impact of the misalignment problem can be alleviated or
  even overcome. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
  the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets. Experimental results show that
  the EP can substantially boost scene text recognition performance.
