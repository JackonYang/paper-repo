paperAbstract: Restart techniques are common in gradient-free optimization to deal
  with multimodal functions. Partial warm restarts are also gaining popularity in
  gradient-based optimization to improve the rate of convergence in accelerated gradient
  schemes to deal with ill-conditioned functions. In this paper, we propose a simple
  warm restart technique for stochastic gradient descent to improve its anytime performance
  when training deep neural networks. We empirically study its performance on the
  CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, where we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results
  at 3.14% and 16.21%, respectively. We also demonstrate its advantages on a dataset
  of EEG recordings and on a downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset. Our source
