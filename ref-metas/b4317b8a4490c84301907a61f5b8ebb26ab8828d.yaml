paperAbstract: "One of the main challenges in question-answering is the potential\
  \ mismatch between the expressions in questions and the expressions in texts. While\
  \ humans appear to use inference rules such as \u2018X writes Y\u2019 implies \u2018\
  X is the author of Y\u2019 in answering questions, such rules are generally unavailable\
  \ to question-answering systems due to the inherent difficulty in constructing them.\
  \ In this paper, we present an unsupervised algorithm for discovering inference\
  \ rules from text. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris\u2019\
  \ Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts\
  \ tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to\
  \ paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus. Essentially, if two paths tend\
  \ to link the same set of words, we hypothesize that their meanings are similar.\
  \ We use examples to show that our system discovers many inference rules easily\
  \ missed by humans."
