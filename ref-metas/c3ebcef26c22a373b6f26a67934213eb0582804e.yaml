paperAbstract: This paper is a comparative study of feature selection methods in statistical
  learning of text categorization The focus is on aggres sive dimensionality reduction
  Five meth ods were evaluated including term selection based on document frequency
  DF informa tion gain IG mutual information MI a test CHI and term strength TS We
  found IG and CHI most e ective in our ex periments Using IG thresholding with a
  k nearest neighbor classi er on the Reuters cor pus removal of up to removal of
  unique terms actually yielded an improved classi cation accuracy measured by average
  preci sion DF thresholding performed similarly Indeed we found strong correlations
  between the DF IG and CHI values of a term This suggests that DF thresholding the
  simplest method with the lowest cost in computation can be reliably used instead
  of IG or CHI when the computation of these measures are too expensive TS compares
  favorably with the other methods with up to vocabulary reduction but is not competitive
  at higher vo cabulary reduction levels In contrast MI had relatively poor performance
  due to its bias towards favoring rare terms and its sen sitivity to probability
  estimation errors
