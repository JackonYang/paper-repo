paperAbstract: A fuel pin hold-down and spacing apparatus for use in nuclear reactors
  is disclosed. Fuel pins forming a hexagonal array are spaced apart from each other
  and held-down at their lower end, securely attached at two places along their length
  to one of a plurality of vertically disposed parallel plates arranged in horizontally
  spaced rows. These plates are in turn spaced apart from each other and held together
  by a combination of spacing and fastening means. The arrangement of this invention
  provides a strong vibration free hold-down mechanism while avoiding a large pressure
  drop to the flow of coolant fluid. This apparatus is particularly useful in connection
  with liquid cooled reactors such as liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactors.
