paperAbstract: may 7th, 1986, Professor A. F. M. Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous
  two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or
  "pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite
  set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel,
  there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about
  its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the
  true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have
  the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics
  of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such
  information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene
  can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden
  is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties
  of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed,
  which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated
  by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the
  assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed.
  Potential applications are mentioned briefly.
