paperAbstract: The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation
  in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image
  segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or
  edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based
  on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both
  types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects.
  First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation.
  Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially
  the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm
  for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte
  around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for
  moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.
