paperAbstract: We propose a model for natural images in which the probability of an
  image is proportional to the product of the probabilities of some filter outputs.
  We encourage the system to find sparse features by using a Student-t distribution
  to model each filter output. If the t-distribution is used to model the combined
  outputs of sets of neurally adjacent filters, the system learns a topographic map
  in which the orientation, spatial frequency and location of the filters change smoothly
  across the map. Even though maximum likelihood learning is intractable in our model,
  the product form allows a relatively efficient learning procedure that works well
  even for highly overcomplete sets of filters. Once the model has been learned it
  can be used as a prior to derive the "iterated Wiener filter" for the purpose of
  denoising images.
