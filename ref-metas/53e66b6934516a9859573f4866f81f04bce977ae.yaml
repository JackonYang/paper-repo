paperAbstract: We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas
  that carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts
  of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing
  and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This
  system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes
  the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized
  to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system
  is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly
  when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as
  a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events.
  Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in
  unilateral spatial neglect.
