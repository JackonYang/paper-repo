paperAbstract: Relationships among objects play a crucial role in image understanding.
  Despite the great success of deep learning techniques in recognizing individual
  objects, reasoning about the relationships among objects remains a challenging task.
  Previous methods often treat this as a classification problem, considering each
  type of relationship (e.g. ride) or each distinct visual phrase (e.g. person-ride-horse)
  as a category. Such approaches are faced with significant difficulties caused by
  the high diversity of visual appearance for each kind of relationships or the large
  number of distinct visual phrases. We propose an integrated framework to tackle
  this problem. At the heart of this framework is the Deep Relational Network, a novel
  formulation designed specifically for exploiting the statistical dependencies between
  objects and their relationships. On two large data sets, the proposed method achieves
  substantial improvement over state-of-the-art.
