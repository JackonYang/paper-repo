paperAbstract: 'Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable
  for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output
  of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds
  have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming
  success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the
  value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently
  lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich
  the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network
  module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds,
  including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed
  in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing
  architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating
  each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates
  local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape
  properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic
  characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show
  the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart,
  and S3DIS.'
