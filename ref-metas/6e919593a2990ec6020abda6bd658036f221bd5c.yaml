paperAbstract: In order to process many kinds of form document, form classification
  must be performed in the first place. However, a substantial amount of time is required
  to analyze and recognize such form documents according to the increase of t, lte
  number of registered models. To solve this problem, w,' suggest document understanding
  with a partial matchmg method in which form structure recognition and form (:lassification
  are performed for only some areas of the input form. In this case, the definition
  of the matching areas and ibrm classification are performed by using a DP matching
  algorithm. By using this approach, the recognition of an input form and the extraction
  of field items can be protessed at a high recognition rate in a reasonable time
  span. in terms of al)plicability, the experimental recognition rate and processing
  time seem to be encouraging.
