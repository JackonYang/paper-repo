paperAbstract: 'Many business documents processed in modern NLP and IR pipelines are
  visually rich: in addition to text, their semantics can also be captured by visual
  traits such as layout, format, and fonts. We study the problem of information extraction
  from visually rich documents (VRDs) and present a model that combines the power
  of large pre-trained language models and graph neural networks to efficiently encode
  both textual and visual information in business documents. We further introduce
  new fine-tuning objectives to improve in-domain unsupervised fine-tuning to better
  utilize large amount of unlabeled in-domain data. We experiment on real world invoice
  and resume data sets and show that the proposed method outperforms strong text-based
  RoBERTa baselines by 6.3% absolute F1 on invoices and 4.7% absolute F1 on resumes.
  When evaluated in a few-shot setting, our method requires up to 30x less annotation
  data than the baseline to achieve the same level of performance at ~90% F1.'
