paperAbstract: This paper presents efficient methodologies to extract information
  from tabular drawings representing telephone cable interconnections. These tables
  include records of cable counts, cables in service, assignment charts, and cable
  running and wiring lists. An interesting problem in these drawings is that the changes
  to the data are occasionally recorded by crossing out entries and appending the
  changes rather than redrawing the entire documents. The objective of the work described
  here is the extraction of information contained in these table structured documents
  to facilitate the creation of a computer database. Our software system makes use
  of contextual information in these drawings (e.g., a particular line pattern is
  used to represent repeated entries, ignore crossed-out entries, etc.). The system
  uses features like inter-line spacing, length of lines, line orientation, and start
  and end locations of the lines to detect the diagonal lines and vertical lines with
  demarcations. Experimental results are also included.
