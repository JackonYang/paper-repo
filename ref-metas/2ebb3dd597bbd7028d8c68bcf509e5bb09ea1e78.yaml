paperAbstract: Relevance feedback is an automatic process, introduced over 20 years
  ago, designed to produce query formulations following an initial retrieval operation.
  The principal relevance feedback methods described over the years are examined briefly,
  and evaluation data are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various
  methods. Prescriptions are given for conducting text retrieval operations iteratively
  using relevance feedback.
