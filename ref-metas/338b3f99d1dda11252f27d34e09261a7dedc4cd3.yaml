paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an attribute graph grammar for image parsing
  on scenes with man-made objects, such as buildings, hallways, kitchens, and living
  moms. We choose one class of primitives - 3D planar rectangles projected on images
  and six graph grammar production rules. Each production rule not only expands a
  node into its components, but also includes a number of equations that constrain
  the attributes of a parent node and those of its children. Thus our graph grammar
  is context sensitive. The grammar rules are used recursively to produce a large
  number of objects and patterns in images and thus the whole graph grammar is a type
  of generative model. The inference algorithm integrates bottom-up rectangle detection
  which activates top-down prediction using the grammar rules. The final results are
  validated in a Bayesian framework. The output of the inference is a hierarchical
  parsing graph with objects, surfaces, rectangles, and their spatial relations. In
  the inference, the acceptance of a grammar rule means recognition of an object,
  and actions are taken to pass the attributes between a node and its parent through
  the constraint equations associated with this production rule. When an attribute
  is passed from a child node to a parent node, it is called bottom-up, and the opposite
  is called top-down
