paperAbstract: 'The standard approach to recognizing text in images consists in first
  classifying local image regions into candidate characters and then combining them
  with high-level word models such as conditional random fields (CRF). This paper
  explores a new paradigm that departs from this bottom-up view. We propose to embed
  word labels and word images into a common Euclidean space. Given a word image to
  be recognized, the text recognition problem is cast as one of retrieval: find the
  closest word label in this space. This common space is learned using the Structured
  SVM (SSVM) framework by enforcing matching label-image pairs to be closer than non-matching
  pairs. This method presents the following advantages: it does not require costly
  preor post-processing operations, it allows for the recognition of never-seen-before
  words and the recognition process is efficient. Experiments are performed on two
  challenging datasets (one of license plates and one of scene text) and show that
  the proposed method is competitive with standard bottom-up approaches to text recognition.'
