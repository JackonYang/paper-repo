paperAbstract: Many Knowledge Bases (KBs) are now readily available and encompass
  colossal quantities of information thanks to either a long-term funding effort (e.g.
  WordNet, OpenCyc) or a collaborative process (e.g. Freebase, DBpedia). However,
  each of them is based on a different rigid symbolic framework which makes it hard
  to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured
  knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like natural
  language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding,
  ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative
  filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural
  network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into
  a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept
  and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily
  used in recent machine learning methods for prediction and information retrieval.
  We illustrate our method on WordNet and Freebase and also present a way to adapt
  it to knowledge extraction from raw text.
