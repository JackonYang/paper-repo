paperAbstract: We address the problem of computing the 3-dimensional shape of an arbitrary
  scene from a set of images taken at known viewpoints. Multi-camera scene reconstruction
  is a natural generalization of the stereo matching problem. However, it is much
  more difficult than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about visibility.
  In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded excellent results for stereo,
  namely energy minimization via graph cuts. We first give an energy minimization
  formulation of the multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we
  minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and
  imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities. As the energy function
  is NP-hard to minimize exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local
  minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations where voxel coloring
  can be used, which is a large and natural class. Experimental data demonstrates
  the effectiveness of our approach.
