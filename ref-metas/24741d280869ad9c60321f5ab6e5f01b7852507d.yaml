paperAbstract: We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using
  end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional
  speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these
  traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments.
  In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background
  noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function
  that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the
  concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system
  that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that
  allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system,
  called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied
  Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also
  handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art
  commercial speech systems.
