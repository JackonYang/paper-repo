paperAbstract: Human pose estimation requires a versatile yet well-constrained spatial
  model for grouping locally ambiguous parts together to produce a globally consistent
  hypothesis. Previous works either use local deformable models deviating from a certain
  template, or use a global mixture representation in the pose space. In this paper,
  we propose a new hierarchical spatial model that can capture an exponential number
  of poses with a compact mixture representation on each part. Using latent nodes,
  it can represent high-order spatial relationship among parts with exact inference.
  Different from recent hierarchical models that associate each latent node to a mixture
  of appearance templates (like HoG), we use the hierarchical structure as a pure
  spatial prior avoiding the large and often confounding appearance space. We verify
  the effectiveness of this model in three ways. First, samples representing human-like
  poses can be drawn from our model, showing its ability to capture high-order dependencies
  of parts. Second, our model achieves accurate reconstruction of unseen poses compared
  to a nearest neighbor pose representation. Finally, our model achieves state-of-art
  performance on three challenging datasets, and substantially outperforms recent
  hierarchical models.
