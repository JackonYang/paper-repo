paperAbstract: The elements of the Hessian matrix consist of the second derivatives
  of the error measure with respect to the weights and thresholds in the network.
  They are needed in Bayesian estimation of network regularization parameters, for
  estimation of error bars on the network outputs, for network pruning algorithms,
  and for fast retraining of the network following a small change in the training
  data. In this paper we present an extended backpropagation algorithm that allows
  all elements of the Hessian matrix to be evaluated exactly for a feedforward network
  of arbitrary topology. Software implementation of the algorithm is straightforward.
