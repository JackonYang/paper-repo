paperAbstract: Bilinear models has been shown to achieve impressive performance on
  a wide range of visual tasks, such as semantic segmentation, fine grained recognition
  and face recognition. However, bilinear features are high dimensional, typically
  on the order of hundreds of thousands to a few million, which makes them impractical
  for subsequent analysis. We propose two compact bilinear representations with the
  same discriminative power as the full bilinear representation but with only a few
  thousand dimensions. Our compact representations allow back-propagation of classification
  errors enabling an end-to-end optimization of the visual recognition system. The
  compact bilinear representations are derived through a novel kernelized analysis
  of bilinear pooling which provide insights into the discriminative power of bilinear
  pooling, and a platform for further research in compact pooling methods. Experimentation
  illustrate the utility of the proposed representations for image classification
  and few-shot learning across several datasets.
