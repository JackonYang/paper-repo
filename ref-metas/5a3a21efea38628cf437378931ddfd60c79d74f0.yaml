paperAbstract: The goal of this work is to detect a human figure image and localize
  his joints and limbs along with their associated pixel masks. In this work we attempt
  to tackle this problem in a general setting. The dataset we use is a collection
  of sports news photographs of baseball players, varying dramatically in pose and
  clothing. The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition
  algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build
  limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures.
  We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted
  full body configurations.
