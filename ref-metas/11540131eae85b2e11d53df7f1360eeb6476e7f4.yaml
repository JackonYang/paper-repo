paperAbstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) can solve
  numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural
  networks (RNNs). We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input
  streams that are not a priori segmented into subsequences with explicitly marked
  ends at which the network's internal state could be reset. Without resets, the state
  may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy
  is a novel, adaptive forget gate that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself
  at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative
  benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All
  algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems.
  LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.
