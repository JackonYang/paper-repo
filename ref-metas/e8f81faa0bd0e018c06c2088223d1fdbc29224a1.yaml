paperAbstract: In an earlier study by Julesz (1962) pairs of random textures were
  generated side-by-side using a Markov process with different third-order joint-probability
  distributions but identical first- and second-order distributions. Such texture
  pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without
  scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the
  general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional.
  Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian
  textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics.
  All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each
  other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual
  elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different.
  However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture
  pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained
  by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations
  give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first
  analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as
  dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple
  extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or
  first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs).
