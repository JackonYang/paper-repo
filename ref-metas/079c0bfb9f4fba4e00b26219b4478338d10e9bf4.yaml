paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a word spotting framework that follows the
  query-by-string paradigm where word images are represented both by textual and visual
  representations. The textual representation is formulated in terms of character
  n-grams while the visual one is based on the bag-of-visual-words scheme. These two
  representations are merged together and projected to a sub-vector space. This transform
  allows to, given a textual query, retrieve word instances that were only represented
  by the visual modality. Moreover, this statistical representation can be used together
  with state-of-the-art indexation structures in order to deal with large-scale scenarios.
  The proposed method is evaluated using a collection of historical documents outperforming
  state-of-the-art performances.
