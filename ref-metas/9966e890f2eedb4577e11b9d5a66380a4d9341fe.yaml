paperAbstract: One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability
  density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically,
  one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of
  the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by
  minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density
  given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While
  the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very
  difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple
  formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does
  not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some
  derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is
  demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models,
  and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data.
