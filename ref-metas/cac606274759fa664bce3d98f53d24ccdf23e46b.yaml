paperAbstract: This paper proposes a bottom-up method for recognizing tables within
  a document. This method is based on the paradigm of graph-rewriting. First, the
  document image is transformed into a layout graph whose nodes and edges represent
  document entities and their interrelations respectively. This graph is subsequently
  rewritten using a set of rules designed based on a priori document knowledge and
  general formatting conventions. The resulting graph provides a logical view of the
  document content. It can be parsed to provide general format analysis information.
