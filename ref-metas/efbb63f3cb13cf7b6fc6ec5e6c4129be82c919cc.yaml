paperAbstract: Previous work on relation extraction has focussed on identifying relationships
  between entities that occur in the same sentence (intra-sentential relations) rather
  than between entities in different sentences (inter-sentential relations) despite
  previous research having shown that intersentential relations commonly occur in
  information extraction corpora. This paper describes a SVM-based approach to relation
  extraction that is applied to both types. Adapted features and techniques for counter-acting
  bias in SVM models are used to deal with specific issues that arise in the inter-sentential
  case. It was found that the structured features used for intrasentential relation
  extraction can be easily adapted for the inter-sentential case and provides comparable
  performance.
