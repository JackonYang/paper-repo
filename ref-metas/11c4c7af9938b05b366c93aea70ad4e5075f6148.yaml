paperAbstract: Objects can be recognized on the basis of their color alone by color
  indexing, a technique developed by Swain-Ballard (1991) which involves matching
  color-space histograms. Color indexing fails, however, when the incident illumination
  varies either spatially or spectrally. Although this limitation might be overcome
  by preprocessing with a color constancy algorithm, we instead propose histogramming
  color ratios. Since the ratios of color RGB triples from neighboring locations are
  relatively insensitive to changes in the incident illumination, this circumvents
  the need for color constancy preprocessing. Results of tests with the new color-constant-color-indexing
  algorithm on synthetic and real images show that it works very well even when the
  illumination varies spatially in its intensity and color. >
