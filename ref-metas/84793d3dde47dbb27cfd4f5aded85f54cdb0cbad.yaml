paperAbstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method
  is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and
  recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component
  methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes
  of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are
  efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented
  bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated
  from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation
  is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class
  variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning.
  The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved
  in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearest-neighbor
  classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on
  a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization
  and recognition.
