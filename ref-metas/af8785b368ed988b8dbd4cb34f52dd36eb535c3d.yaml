paperAbstract: "In this article, a region-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network\
  \ framework is presented for document structure learning. The contribution of this\
  \ work involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective ensembling\
  \ for document image classification. A primary level of \u2018inter-domain\u2019\
  \ transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16 architecture\
  \ on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole document images.\
  \ Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a secondary level of\
  \ \u2018intra-domain\u2019 transfer learning is used for rapid training of deep\
  \ learning models for image segments. Finally, a stacked generalization based ensembling\
  \ is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep neural network models.\
  \ The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.21% on the popular\
  \ RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding the benchmarks set by the existing\
  \ algorithms."
