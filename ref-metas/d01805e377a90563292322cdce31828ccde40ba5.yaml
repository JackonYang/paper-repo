paperAbstract: Grouping images into (semantically) meaningful categories using low
  level visual features is a challenging and important problem in content based image
  retrieval. Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high level concepts
  from low level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong
  to one of the classes of interest. Specifically, we consider the hierarchical classification
  of vacation images; at the highest level, images are classified into indoor/outdoor
  classes, outdoor images are further classified into city/landscape classes, and
  finally, a subset of landscape images is classified into sunset, forest, and mountain
  classes. We demonstrate that a small codebook (the optimal size of codebook is selected
  using a modified MDL criterion) extracted from a vector quantizer can be used to
  estimate the class-conditional densities of the observed features needed for the
  Bayesian methodology. On a database of 6931 vacation photographs, our system achieved
  an accuracy of 90.5% for indoor vs. outdoor classification, 95.3% for city vs. landscape
  classification, 96.6% for sunset vs. forest and mountain classification, and 95.5%
  for forest vs. mountain classification. We further develop a learning paradigm to
  incrementally train the classifiers as additional training samples become available
  and also show preliminary results for feature size reduction using clustering techniques.
