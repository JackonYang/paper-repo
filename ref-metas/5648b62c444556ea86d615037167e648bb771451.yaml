paperAbstract: Recent stereo algorithms have achieved impressive results by modelling
  the disparity image as a Markov Random Field (MRF). An important component of an
  MRF-based approach is the inference algorithm used to find the most likely setting
  of each node in the MRF. Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief
  propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference
  algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute
  the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm.
  We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation
  algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created
  for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the
  two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower
  energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily
  lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth.
