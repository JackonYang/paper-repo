paperAbstract: A family of graph-theoretical algorithms based on the minimal spanning
  tree are capable of detecting several kinds of cluster structure in arbitrary point
  sets; description of the detected clusters is possible in some cases by extensions
  of the method. Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples
  from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts
  or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher
  dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods
  include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to
  gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone
  transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application
  of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern
  recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are
  illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional
  space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the
  minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged.
