paperAbstract: "The aim of this paper is to present a brief proof of the following\
  \ theorem: Theorem. For any integer n \u2265 2 there are continuous real functions\
  \ \u03C8 p q (x) on the closed unit interval E 1 = [0;1] such that each continuous\
  \ real function f(x 1 ,\u2026,x n ) on the n-dimensional unit cube E n is representable\
  \ as \n \n$$f\\left( {{{x}_{1}}, \\ldots ,{{x}_{n}}} \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{{q\
  \ = 1}}^{{q = 2n + 1}} {Xq\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{{p = 1}}^{n} {{{\\psi }^{{pq}}}\\\
  left( {{{x}_{p}}} \\right)} } \\right]} ,$$ \n \n(1) \n \nwhere x q (y) are continuous\
  \ real functions."
