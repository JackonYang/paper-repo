paperAbstract: "Offline handwriting recognition\u2014the automatic transcription of\
  \ images of handwritten text\u2014is a challenging task that combines computer vision\
  \ with sequence learning. In most systems the two elements are handled separately,\
  \ with sophisticated preprocessing techniques used to extract the image features\
  \ and sequential models such as HMMs used to provide the transcriptions. By combining\
  \ two recent innovations in neural networks\u2014multidimensional recurrent neural\
  \ networks and connectionist temporal classification\u2014this paper introduces\
  \ a globally trained offline handwriting recogniser that takes raw pixel data as\
  \ input. Unlike competing systems, it does not require any alphabet specific preprocessing,\
  \ and can therefore be used unchanged for any language. Evidence of its generality\
  \ and power is provided by data from a recent international Arabic recognition competition,\
  \ where it outperformed all entries (91.4% accuracy compared to 87.2% for the competition\
  \ winner) despite the fact that neither author understands a word of Arabic."
