paperAbstract: Standard alphabetical procedures for organizing lexical information
  put together words that are spelled alike and scatter words with similar or related
  meanings haphazardly through the list. Unfortunately, there is no obvious alternative,
  no other simple way for lexicographers to keep track of what has been done or for
  readers to find the word they are looking for. But a frequent objection to this
  solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming.
  Many people who would like to refer to a dictionary decide not to bother with it
  because finding the information would interrupt their work and break their train
  of thought.
