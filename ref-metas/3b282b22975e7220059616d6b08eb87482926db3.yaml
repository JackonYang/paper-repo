paperAbstract: "Kernel machines rely on an implicit mapping of the data such that\
  \ non-linear classification in the original space corresponds to linear classification\
  \ in the new space. As kernel machines are difficult to scale to large training\
  \ sets, it has been proposed to perform an explicit mapping of the data and to learn\
  \ directly linear classifiers in the new space. In this paper, we consider the problem\
  \ of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using\
  \ bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers.\
  \ We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA) [15],\
  \ 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for\
  \ shift-invariant kernels [14]. We report experiments on 3 datasets: Cal-tech101,\
  \ VOC07 and ImageNet. An important conclusion is that simply square-rooting BOV\
  \ vectors \u2013 which corresponds to an exact mapping for the Bhattacharyya kernel\
  \ \u2013 already leads to large improvements, often quite close to the best results\
  \ obtained with additive kernels. Another conclusion is that, although it is possible\
  \ to go beyond additive kernels, the embedding comes at a much higher cost."
