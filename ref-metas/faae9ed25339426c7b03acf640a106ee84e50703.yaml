paperAbstract: 'The objective of this work is object retrieval in large scale image
  datasets, where the object is specified by an image query and retrieval should be
  immediate at run time in the manner of Video Google [28]. We make the following
  three contributions: (i) a new method to compare SIFT descriptors (RootSIFT) which
  yields superior performance without increasing processing or storage requirements;
  (ii) a novel method for query expansion where a richer model for the query is learnt
  discriminatively in a form suited to immediate retrieval through efficient use of
  the inverted index; (iii) an improvement of the image augmentation method proposed
  by Turcot and Lowe [29], where only the augmenting features which are spatially
  consistent with the augmented image are kept. We evaluate these three methods over
  a number of standard benchmark datasets (Oxford Buildings 5k and 105k, and Paris
  6k) and demonstrate substantial improvements in retrieval performance whilst maintaining
  immediate retrieval speeds. Combining these complementary methods achieves a new
  state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.'
