paperAbstract: We present a latent hierarchical structural learning method for object
  detection. An object is represented by a mixture of hierarchical tree models where
  the nodes represent object parts. The nodes can move spatially to allow both local
  and global shape deformations. The models can be trained discriminatively using
  latent structural SVM learning, where the latent variables are the node positions
  and the mixture component. But current learning methods are slow, due to the large
  number of parameters and latent variables, and have been restricted to hierarchies
  with two layers. In this paper we describe an incremental concave-convex procedure
  (iCCCP) which allows us to learn both two and three layer models efficiently. We
  show that iCCCP leads to a simple training algorithm which avoids complex multi-stage
  layer-wise training, careful part selection, and achieves good performance without
  requiring elaborate initialization. We perform object detection using our learnt
  models and obtain performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods when evaluated
  on challenging public PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of three layer
  hierarchies - outperforming Felzenszwalb et al.'s two layer models on all 20 classes.
