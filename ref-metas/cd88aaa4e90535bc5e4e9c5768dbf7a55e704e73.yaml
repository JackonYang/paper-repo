paperAbstract: 'Detecting tables in a spreadsheet is the first step needed to make
  spreadsheet documents accessible to individuals with visual disabilities. Techniques
  to enable aural presentation and navigation of tables have been proposed, but they
  assume a thorough knowledge of the structure of the table; on the other hand, boundaries
  and structure of tables in a spreadsheet are not evident without a visual exploration.
  This paper presents an algorithm for table recognition in spreadsheets. The algorithm
  uses three types of cells as its basis: title cell, header cell, and data cell.
  Different attributes of the cells are used to identify the cell type within a spreadsheet.
  Hierarchical clustering is used to aggregate cells to compose the functional components
  of a table. The algorithm has been evaluated on a diverse set of benchmarks with
  very encouraging results.'
