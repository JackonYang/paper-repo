paperAbstract: We present randomized approximation algorithms for the maximum cut
  (MAX CUT) and maximum 2-satisfiability (MAX 2SAT) problems that always deliver solutions
  of expected value at least.87856 times the optimal value. These algorithms use a
  simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming
  relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and
  as an eigenvalue minimization problem. The best previously known approximation algorithms
  for these problems had performance guarantees of 1/2 for MAX CUT and 3/4 or MAX
  2SAT. Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a.79607-approximation algorithm
  for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a.758-approximation algorithm
  for MAX SAT, where the best previously known approximation algorithms had performance
  guarantees of 1/4 and 3/4, respectively. Our algorithm gives the first substantial
  progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and represents the first
  use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms.
