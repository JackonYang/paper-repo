paperAbstract: 'We present an approach to low-level vision that combines two main
  ideas: the use of convolutional networks as an image processing architecture and
  an unsupervised learning procedure that synthesizes training samples from specific
  noise models. We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of natural
  image denoising. Using a test set with a hundred natural images, we find that convolutional
  networks provide comparable and in some cases superior performance to state of the
  art wavelet and Markov random field (MRF) methods. Moreover, we find that a convolutional
  network offers similar performance in the blind de-noising setting as compared to
  other techniques in the non-blind setting. We also show how convolutional networks
  are mathematically related to MRF approaches by presenting a mean field theory for
  an MRF specially designed for image denoising. Although these approaches are related,
  convolutional networks avoid computational difficulties in MRF approaches that arise
  from probabilistic learning and inference. This makes it possible to learn image
  processing architectures that have a high degree of representational power (we train
  models with over 15,000 parameters), but whose computational expense is significantly
  less than that associated with inference in MRF approaches with even hundreds of
  parameters.'
