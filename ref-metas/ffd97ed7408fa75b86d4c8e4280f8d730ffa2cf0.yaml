paperAbstract: Optical flow estimation is classically marked by the requirement of
  dense sampling in time. While coarse-to-fine warping schemes have somehow relaxed
  this constraint, there is an inherent dependency between the scale of structures
  and the velocity that can be estimated. This particularly renders the estimation
  of detailed human motion problematic, as small body parts can move very fast. In
  this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors
  into the variational optical flow setting. This way we can estimate a dense optical
  flow field with almost the same high accuracy as known from variational optical
  flow, while reaching out to new domains of motion analysis where the requirement
  of dense sampling in time is no longer satisfied.
