paperAbstract: We present the first unsupervised approach to the problem of learning
  a semantic parser, using Markov logic. Our USP system transforms dependency trees
  into quasi-logical forms, recursively induces lambda forms from these, and clusters
  them to abstract away syntactic variations of the same meaning. The MAP semantic
  parse of a sentence is obtained by recursively assigning its parts to lambda-form
  clusters and composing them. We evaluate our approach by using it to extract a knowledge
  base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. USP substantially outperforms
  TextRunner, DIRT and an informed baseline on both precision and recall on this task.
