paperAbstract: 'We contribute 5-gram counts and language models trained on the Common
  Crawl corpus, a collection over 9 billion web pages. This release improves upon
  the Google n-gram counts in two key ways: the inclusion of low-count entries and
  deduplication to reduce boilerplate. By preserving singletons, we were able to use
  Kneser-Ney smoothing to build large language models. This paper describes how the
  corpus was processed with emphasis on the problems that arise in working with data
  at this scale. Our unpruned Kneser-Ney English $5$-gram language model, built on
  975 billion deduplicated tokens, contains over 500 billion unique n-grams. We show
  gains of 0.5-1.4 BLEU by using large language models to translate into various languages.'
