paperAbstract: Our goal is to recognize human action at a distance, at resolutions
  where a whole person may be, say, 30 pixels tall. We introduce a novel motion descriptor
  based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized
  human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor
  framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which
  is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather
  as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated
  to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed
  by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database
  of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars
  to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two
  forms of data-based action synthesis "do as I do" and "do as I say". Results are
  demonstrated on ballet, tennis as well as football datasets.
