paperAbstract: "We present a method for searching in an image database using a query\
  \ image that is similar to the intended target. The query image may be a hand-drawn\
  \ sketch or a (potentially low-quality) scan of the image to be retrieved. Our searching\
  \ algorithm makes use of multiresolution wavelet decompositions of the query and\
  \ database images. The coefficients of these decompositions are distilled into small\
  \ \u201Csignatures\u201D for each image. We introduce an \u201Cimage querying metric\u201D\
  \ that operates on these signatures. This metric essentially compares how many significant\
  \ wavelet coefficients the query has in common with potential targets. The metric\
  \ includes parameters that can be tuned, using a statistical analysis, to accommodate\
  \ the kinds of image distortions found in different types of image queries. The\
  \ resulting algorithm is simple, requires very little storage overhead for the database\
  \ of signatures, and is fast enough to be performed on a database of 20,000 images\
  \ at interactive rates (on standard desktop machines) as a query is sketched. Our\
  \ experiments with hundreds of queries in databases of 1000 and 20,000 images show\
  \ dramatic improvement, in both speed and success rate, over using a conventional\
  \ L1, L2, or color histogram norm. CR"
