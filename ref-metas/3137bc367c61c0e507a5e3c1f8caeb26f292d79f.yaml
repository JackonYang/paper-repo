paperAbstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be
  invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle,
  in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised
  manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features.
  However, it is difficult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than
  using them in a classifier. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests
  that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to
  different input transformations. We find that stacked autoencoders learn modestly
  increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We find
  that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features
  in each layer. These results further justify the use of "deep" vs. "shallower" representations,
  but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another
  may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used
  to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future
  algorithms.
