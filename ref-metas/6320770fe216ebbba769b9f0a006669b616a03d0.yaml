paperAbstract: The application of kernel-based learning algorithms has, so far, largely
  been confined to realvalued data and a few special data types, such as strings.
  In this paper we propose a general method of constructing natural families of kernels
  over discrete structures, based on the matrix exponentiation idea. In particular,
  we focus on generating kernels on graphs, for which we propose a special class of
  exponential kernels called diffusion kernels, which are based on the heat equation
  and can be regarded as the discretization of the familiar Gaussian kernel of Euclidean
  space.
