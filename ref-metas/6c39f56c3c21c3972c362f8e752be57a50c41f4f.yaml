paperAbstract: Sentences that describe visual scenes contain a wide variety of information
  pertaining to the presence of objects, their attributes and their spatial relations.
  In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived
  from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns
  and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition,
  adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field
  (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their
  relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from
  the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences' visual meaning
  by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based
  image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey
  the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple
  sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches.
