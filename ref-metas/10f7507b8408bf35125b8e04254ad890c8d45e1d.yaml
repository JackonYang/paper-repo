paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The paper describes a system for the computer understanding
  of English. The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information
  in normal English dialog. It uses semantic information and context to understand
  discourse and to disambiguate sentences. It combines a complete syntactic analysis
  of each sentence with a ''heuristic understander'' which uses different kinds of
  information about a sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information
  about the world in deciding what the sentence means.'
