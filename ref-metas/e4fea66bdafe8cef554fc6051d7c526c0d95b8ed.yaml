paperAbstract: Six formal properties of anisotropic linear two-dimensional filters
  are noted which are relevant for modeling the mechanisms of spatial visual information
  extraction. These properties concern the relationship between the organizational
  principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field
  (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated
  by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences
  for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated
  without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they
  are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional
  filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional
  receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection
  of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds.
