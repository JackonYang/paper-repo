paperAbstract: 'We present an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger based on a
  hidden Markov model. The methodology enables robust and accurate tagging with few
  resource requirements. Only a lexicon and some unlabeled training text are required.
  Accuracy exceeds 96%. We describe implementation strategies and optimizations which
  result in high-speed operation. Three applications for tagging are described: phrase
  recognition; word sense disambiguation; and grammatical function assignment.'
