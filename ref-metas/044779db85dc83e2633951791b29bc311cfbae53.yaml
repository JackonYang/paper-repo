paperAbstract: We present a new framework for recognizing planar object classes, which
  is based on local feature detectors and a probabilistic model of the spatial arrangement
  of the features. The allowed object deformations are represented through shape statistics,
  which are learned from examples. Instances of an object in an image are detected
  by finding the appropriate features in the correct spatial configuration. The algorithm
  is robust with respect to partial occlusion, detector false alarms, and missed features.
  A 94% success rate was achieved for the problem of locating quasi-frontal views
  of faces in cluttered scenes.
