paperAbstract: The table recognition literature contains many strategies specified
  informally as a sequence of operations, obscuring both models of table structure
  and the effects of individual decisions. Decision making is more transparent in
  formal model based approaches (e.g. grammar based) but these approaches are less
  flexible than informal ones. We propose an intermediate level of formalization,
  defining strategies as a sequence of basic graph transformations that correspond
  to recognition operations (e.g. classification, segmentation). Transformations are
  parameterized by logical types and decision functions, which together define structure
  models and executable strategies for interpreting input graphs. We provide an overview
  of our first attempt at this intermediate level of formalization, the Recognition
  Strategy Language (RSL). As a proof of concept, we reimplement two informally specified
  table recognition strategies from the literature in RSL. The RSL implementations
  capture descriptions of the formerly implicit table structure models, and automatically
  capture all decision making.
