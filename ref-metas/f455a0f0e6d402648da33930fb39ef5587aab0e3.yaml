paperAbstract: Abstract An efficient automatic text detection and location method
  for video documents is proposed and its application for the content-based retrieval
  of video is presented and discussed. Target frames are selected at fixed time intervals
  from shots detected by a scene-change detection method. For each selected frame,
  segmentation by color clustering is performed around color peaks using a color histogram.
  For each color plane, text-lines are detected using heuristics, and the temporal
  and spatial position and the text-image of each text-line are stored in a database.
  Experimental results for text detection in video images and the performance of the
  method are reported for various video documents. A user interface for text-image
  based browsing is designed for direct content-based access to video documents, and
  other applications are discussed.
