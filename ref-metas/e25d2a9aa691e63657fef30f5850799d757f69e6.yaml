paperAbstract: 'We present a novel unsupervised learning method for human action categories.
  A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting
  space-time interest points. The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions
  of the spatial-temporal words and the intermediate topics corresponding to human
  action categories. This is achieved by using latent topic models such as the probabilistic
  Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our
  approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving
  cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video
  sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained
  in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human
  motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure
  skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach. In addition,
  our algorithm can recognize and localize multiple actions in long and complex video
  sequences containing multiple motions.'
