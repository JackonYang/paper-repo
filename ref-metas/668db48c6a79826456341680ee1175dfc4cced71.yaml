paperAbstract: 'Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach
  for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting
  and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two
  shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they
  tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments
  the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First,
  we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text
  via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the
  ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to
  keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our
  model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive
  state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.'
