paperAbstract: Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision.
  An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The
  left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with
  eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a
  Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal
  scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings
  of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range
  of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity
  range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output
  of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come
  into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing
  with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at
  a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic
  buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio
  model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms
  from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated
  and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr &
  Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the
  process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of
  a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail.
