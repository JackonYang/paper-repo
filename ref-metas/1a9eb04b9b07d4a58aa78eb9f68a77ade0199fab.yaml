paperAbstract: Human action in video sequences can be seen as silhouettes of a moving
  torso and protruding limbs undergoing articulated motion. We regard human actions
  as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume.
  We adopt a recent approach by Gorelick et al. (2004) for analyzing 2D shapes and
  generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes
  properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features
  such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation.
  We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering.
  The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not
  limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate
  the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant
  changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action
  and low quality video
