paperAbstract: We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions,
  the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is
  based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the
  other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by
  Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation
  scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination
  leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity
  better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to
  the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms
  are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust
  than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations
  of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical
  of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the
  EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture,
  and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.
