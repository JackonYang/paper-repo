paperAbstract: In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts have
  been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer vision. Each of
  these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also
  minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly
  specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application
  to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that
  can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary
  variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily
  applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo,
  motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization
  of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions
  that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables.
  We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function.
  Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables
  to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph
  cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if
  this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.
  A software implementation is freely available.
