paperAbstract: 'Sequence prediction and classification are ubiquitous and challenging
  problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies between
  temporally distant inputs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in
  theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory
  implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they
  are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper
  introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture,
  the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate
  modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations
  only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more
  complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly
  in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated
  in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT
  spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and
  online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.'
