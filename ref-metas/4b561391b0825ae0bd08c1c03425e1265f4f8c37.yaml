paperAbstract: The relative merits of performing local operations on ~ digitized picture
  in parallel or sequentially are discussed. Sequential local operations are described
  which l~bel the connected components of a given subset of the picture and compute
  u "distance" from every picture element to the subset. In terms of the "distance"
  function, ~ "skeleton" subset is defined which, in a certain sense, minimally determines
  the original subset. Some applications of the connected component and distance functions
  are also presented.
