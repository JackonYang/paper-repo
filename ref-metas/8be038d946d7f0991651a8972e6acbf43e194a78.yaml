paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problems of 1) representing natural shapes
  such as mountains, trees, and clouds, and 2) computing their description from image
  data. To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their
  images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions
  are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes
  produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool
  for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown
  that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process,
  furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The
  3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for
  which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization
  is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The
  3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation
  and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing
  between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene.
