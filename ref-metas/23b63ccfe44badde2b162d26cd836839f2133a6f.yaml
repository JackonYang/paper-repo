paperAbstract: 'We describe a new approach for evaluating page segmentation algorithms.
  Unlike techniques that rely on OCR output, our method is region-based: the segmentation
  output, described as a set of regions together with their types, output order etc.,
  is matched against the pre-stored set of ground-truth regions. Misclassifications,
  splitting, and merging of regions are among the errors that are detected by the
  system. Each error is weighted individually for a particular application and a global
  estimate of segmentation quality is derived. The system can be customized to benchmark
  specific aspects of segmentation (e.g., headline detection) and according to the
  type of error correction that might follow (e.g., re-typing). Segmentation ground-truth
  files are quickly and easily generated and edited using GroundsKeeper, an X-Window
  based tool that allows one to view a document, manually draw regions (arbitrary
  polygons) on it, and specify information about each region (e.g., type, parent).'
