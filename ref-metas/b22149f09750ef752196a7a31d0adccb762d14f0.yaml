paperAbstract: 'Tables are important components of technical documents. This paper
  addresses the following problems: (i) identifying a tabular component in a scanned
  image of a compound document containing text, drawings, diagrams, etc.; (ii) understanding
  the content of the table in order to convert the table into electronic format. As
  far as the authors are aware, the problems addressed are new. An algorithm for performing
  both the above tasks has been studied and implemented. Preliminary experimental
  results indicate satisfactory performance for many table lay-out styles.<<ETX>>'
