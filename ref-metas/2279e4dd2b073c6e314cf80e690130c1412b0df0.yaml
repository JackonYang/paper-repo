paperAbstract: We investigate how to iteratively and mutually boost object classification
  and detection performance by taking the outputs from one task as the context of
  the other one. While context models have been quite popular, previous works mainly
  concentrate on co-occurrence relationship within classes and few of them focus on
  contextualization from a top-down perspective, i.e. high-level task context. In
  this paper, our system adopts a new method for adaptive context modeling and iterative
  boosting. First, the contextualized support vector machine (Context-SVM) is proposed,
  where the context takes the role of dynamically adjusting the classification score
  based on the sample ambiguity, and thus the context-adaptive classifier is achieved.
  Then, an iterative training procedure is presented. In each step, Context-SVM, associated
  with the output context from one task (object classification or detection), is instantiated
  to boost the performance for the other task, whose augmented outputs are then further
  used to improve the former task by Context-SVM. The proposed solution is evaluated
  on the object classification and detection tasks of PASCAL Visual Object Classes
  Challenge (VOC) 2007, 2010 and SUN09 data sets, and achieves the state-of-the-art
  performance.
