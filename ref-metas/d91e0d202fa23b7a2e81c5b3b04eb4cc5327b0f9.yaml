paperAbstract: Document image understanding encompasses the technology required to
  make paper documents equivalent to other computer exchange media like floppies,
  tapes, and CDROMs. The physical reader of the paper document is the scanner just
  like the physical reader of the floppy is the floppy drive and the physical reader
  of the tape cartridge is the tape cartridge drive, and the physical reader of the
  CDROM is the CDROM drive. In the survey presented, we restrict ourselves to documents
  such as business letters, forms, and scientific and technical articles such as those
  found in archival journals and technical conferences. Understanding such documents
  involves estimating the rotation skew of each document page, determining the geometric
  page layout, labeling blocks as text or non-text, determining the read order for
  text blocks, recognizing the text of text blocks through an OCR system, determining
  the logical page layout, and formatting the data and information of the document
  in a suitable way for use by a word processing system or by an information retrieval
  system.<<ETX>>
