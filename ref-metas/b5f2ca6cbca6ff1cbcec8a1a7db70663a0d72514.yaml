paperAbstract: We treat the problem of edge detection as one of statistical inference.
  Local edge cues, implemented by filters, provide information about the likely positions
  of edges which can be used as input to higher-level models. Different edge cues
  can be evaluated by the statistical effectiveness of their corresponding filters
  evaluated on a dataset of 100 presegmented images. We use information theoretic
  measures to determine the effectiveness of a variety of different edge detectors
  working at multiple scales on black and white and color images. Our results give
  quantitative measures for the advantages of multi-level processing, for the use
  of chromaticity in addition to greyscale, and for the relative effectiveness of
  different detectors.
