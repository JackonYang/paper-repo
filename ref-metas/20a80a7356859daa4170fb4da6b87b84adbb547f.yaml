paperAbstract: "A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The\
  \ approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association\
  \ of terms with documents (\u201Csemantic structure\u201D) in order to improve the\
  \ detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular\
  \ technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document\
  \ matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original\
  \ matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by\
  \ ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document\
  \ vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold\
  \ cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method\
  \ for retrieval to be promising."
