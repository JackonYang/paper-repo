paperAbstract: 'Adapted waveform analysis uses a library of orthonormal bases and
  an efficiency functional to match a basis to a given signal or family of signals.
  It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images.
  The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets
  and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency
  localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal
  basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest
  information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties
  of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are
  thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive
  is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >'
