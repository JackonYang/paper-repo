paperAbstract: Approaches to the zero-frequency problem in adaptive text compression
  are discussed. This problem relates to the estimation of the likelihood of a novel
  event occurring. Although several methods have been used, their suitability has
  been on empirical evaluation rather than a well-founded model. The authors propose
  the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel
  tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied
  to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required
  to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains
  observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small
  improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously
  known. >
