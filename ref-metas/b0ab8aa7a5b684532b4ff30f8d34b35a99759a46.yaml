paperAbstract: 'Recognition is graduating from labs to real-world applications. While
  it is encouraging to see its potential being tapped, it brings forth a fundamental
  challenge to the vision researcher: scalability. How can we learn a model for any
  concept that exhaustively covers all its appearance variations, while requiring
  minimal or no human supervision for compiling the vocabulary of visual variance,
  gathering the training images and annotations, and learning the models? In this
  paper, we introduce a fully-automated approach for learning extensive models for
  a wide range of variations (e.g. actions, interactions, attributes and beyond) within
  any concept. Our approach leverages vast resources of online books to discover the
  vocabulary of variance, and intertwines the data collection and modeling steps to
  alleviate the need for explicit human supervision in training the models. Our approach
  organizes the visual knowledge about a concept in a convenient and useful way, enabling
  a variety of applications across vision and NLP. Our online system has been queried
  by users to learn models for several interesting concepts including breakfast, Gandhi,
  beautiful, etc. To date, our system has models available for over 50, 000 variations
  within 150 concepts, and has annotated more than 10 million images with bounding
  boxes.'
