paperAbstract: 'Abstract : In certain contexts, maximum entropy (ME) modeling can
  be viewed as maximum likelihood training for exponential models, and like other
  maximum likelihood methods is prone to overfitting of training data. Several smoothing
  methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but
  previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing
  methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work
  in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms
  with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the
  mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between
  maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge
  the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods. Over a large number of data
  sets, we find that an ME smoothing method proposed to us by Lafferty performs as
  well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. This general and
  efficient method involves using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model
  and selecting maximum a posteriori instead of maximum likelihood parameter values.
  We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior
  performance.'
