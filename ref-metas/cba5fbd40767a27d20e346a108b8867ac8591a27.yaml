paperAbstract: 'We present a novel architecture, the "stacked what-where auto-encoders"
  (SWWAE), which integrates discriminative and generative pathways and provides a
  unified approach to supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning without
  relying on sampling during training. An instantiation of SWWAE uses a convolutional
  net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and employs a deconvolutional
  net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the reconstruction. The objective
  function includes reconstruction terms that induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet
  to be similar to those of the Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables:
  the "what" which are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable "where"
  that are fed to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder.'
