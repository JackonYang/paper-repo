paperAbstract: Many large collections of document images are now becoming available
  online as part of digital library initiatives, fueled by the explosive growth of
  the World Wide Web. In this paper, we examine protocols and system-related issues
  that arise in attempting to make use of these new resources, both as a target application
  (building better search engines) and as a way of overcoming the problem of acquiring
  ground-truth to support experimental document analysis research. We also report
  on our experiences running two simple tests involving data drawn from one such collection.
  The potential synergies between document analysis and digital libraries could lead
  to substantial benefits for both communities.
