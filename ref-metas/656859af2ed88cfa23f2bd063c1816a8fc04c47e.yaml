paperAbstract: This paper proposes the use of maximum entropy techniques for text
  classification. Maximum entropy is a probability distribution estimation technique
  widely used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as language modeling,
  part-of-speech tagging, and text segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum
  entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that
  are uniform. Constraints on the distribution, derived from labeled training data,
  inform the technique where to be minimally non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation
  has a unique solution which can be found by the improved iterative scaling algorithm.
  In this paper, maximum entropy is used for text classification by estimating the
  conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. In experiments
  on several text datasets we compare accuracy to naive Bayes and show that maximum
  entropy is sometimes significantly better, but also sometimes worse. Much future
  work remains, but the results indicate that maximum entropy is a promising technique
  for text classification.
