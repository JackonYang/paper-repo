paperAbstract: A performance evaluation protocol for the layout analysis is discussed
  in this paper. In the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III,
  there are 1600 English document images that come with manually edited ground truth
  of entity bounding boxes. These bounding boxes enclose text and non-text zones,
  text-lines, and words. We describe a performance metric for the comparison of the
  detected entities and the ground truth in terms of their bounding boxes. The Document
  Attribute Format Specification is used as the standard data representation. The
  protocol is intended to serve as a model for using the UW-III database to evaluate
  the document analysis algorithms. A set of layout analysis algorithms which detect
  different entities have been tested based on the data set and the performance metric.
  The evaluation results are presented in this paper.
