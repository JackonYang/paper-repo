paperAbstract: "We present a probabilistic generative model of visual attributes,\
  \ together with an efficient learning algorithm. Attributes are visual qualities\
  \ of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes\
  \ as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties.\
  \ These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within\
  \ the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account,\
  \ such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for\
  \ stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt\
  \ discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the\
  \ experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and\
  \ encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt\
  \ starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize\
  \ the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."
