paperAbstract: "We address the problem of image feature learning for scene text recognition.\
  \ The image features in the state-of-the-art methods are learned from large-scale\
  \ synthetic image datasets. However, most methods only rely on outputs of the synthetic\
  \ data generation process, namely realistically looking images, and completely ignore\
  \ the rest of the process. We propose to leverage the parameters that lead to the\
  \ output images to improve image feature learning. Specifically, for every image\
  \ out of the data generation process, we obtain the associated parameters and render\
  \ another \u201Cclean\u201D image that is free of select distortion factors that\
  \ are applied to the output image. Because of the absence of distortion factors,\
  \ the clean image tends to be easier to recognize than the original image which\
  \ can serve as supervision. We design a multi-task network with an encoder-discriminator-generator\
  \ architecture to guide the feature of the original image toward that of the clean\
  \ image. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\
  \ methods on standard scene text recognition benchmarks in the lexicon-free category.\
  \ Furthermore, we show that without explicit handling, our method works on challenging\
  \ cases where input images contain severe geometric distortion, such as text on\
  \ a curved path."
