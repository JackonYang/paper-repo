paperAbstract: Object detection has over the past few years converged on using linear
  SVMs over HOG features. Training linear SVMs however is quite expensive, and can
  become intractable as the number of categories increase. In this work we revisit
  a much older technique, viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis, and show that LDA models
  can be trained almost trivially, and with little or no loss in performance. The
  covariance matrices we estimate capture properties of natural images. Whitening
  HOG features with these covariances thus removes naturally occuring correlations
  between the HOG features. We show that these whitened features (which we call WHO)
  are considerably better than the original HOG features for computing similarities,
  and prove their usefulness in clustering. Finally, we use our findings to produce
  an object detection system that is competitive on PASCAL VOC 2007 while being considerably
  easier to train and test.
