paperAbstract: "Texture-map computations can be made tractable through use of precalculated\
  \ tables which allow computational costs independent of the texture density. The\
  \ first example of this technique, the \u201Cmip\u201D map, uses a set of tables\
  \ containing successively lower-resolution representations filtered down from the\
  \ discrete texture function. An alternative method using a single table of values\
  \ representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself\
  \ may yield superior results at similar cost. The necessary algorithms to support\
  \ the new technique are explained. Finally, the cost and performance of the new\
  \ technique is compared to previous techniques."
