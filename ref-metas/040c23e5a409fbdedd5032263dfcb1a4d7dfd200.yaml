paperAbstract: We introduce a novel set of features for robust object recognition.
  Each element of this set is a complex feature obtained by combining position- and
  scale-tolerant edge-detectors over neighboring positions and multiple orientations.
  Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex.
  We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms
  several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different
  object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very
  few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility
  proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.
