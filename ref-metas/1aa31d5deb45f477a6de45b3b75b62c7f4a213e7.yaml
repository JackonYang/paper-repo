paperAbstract: 'Abstract : This thesis examines the acoustic-modeling problem in automatic
  speech recognition from an information-theoretic point of view. This problem is
  to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform
  as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information
  extraction process is broken down into two steps: a signal processing step which
  converts a speech waveform into a sequence of information bearing acoustic feature
  vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. This thesis is primarily concerned
  with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which
  lie in a continuous space such as R sub N. It explores the trade-off between packing
  a lot of information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately.
  The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous parameter sequences is
  addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is specifically
  designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions.'
