paperAbstract: "In this paper, we propose a new tool to efficiently extract a class\
  \ of \u201Clow-rank textures\u201D in a 3D scene from user-specified windows in\
  \ 2D images despite significant corruptions and warping. The low-rank textures capture\
  \ geometrically meaningful structures in an image, which encompass conventional\
  \ local features such as edges and corners as well as many kinds of regular, symmetric\
  \ patterns ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to\
  \ finding these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization\
  \ that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross\
  \ sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant affine or projective\
  \ deformation, our method can accurately recover both the intrinsic low-rank texture\
  \ and the unknown transformation, and hence both the geometry and appearance of\
  \ the associated planar region in 3D. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\
  \ that this new technique works effectively for many regular and near-regular patterns\
  \ or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as symmetrical patterns, building\
  \ facades, printed text, and human faces."
