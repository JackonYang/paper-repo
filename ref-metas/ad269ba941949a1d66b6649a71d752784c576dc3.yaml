paperAbstract: We present a technique for augmenting annotated training data with
  hierarchical word clusters that are automatically derived from a large unannotated
  corpus. Cluster membership is encoded in features that are incorporated in a discriminatively
  trained tagging model. Active learning is used to select training examples. We evaluate
  the technique for named-entity tagging. Compared with a state-of-the-art HMM-based
  name finder, the presented technique requires only 13% as much annotated data to
  achieve the same level of performance. Given a large annotated training set of 1,000,000
  words, the technique achieves a 25% reduction in error over the state-of-the-art
  HMM trained on the same material.
