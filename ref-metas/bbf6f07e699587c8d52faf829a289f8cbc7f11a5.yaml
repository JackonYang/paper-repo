paperAbstract: 'On-line first-order backpropagation is sufficiently fast and effective
  for many large-scale classification problems but for very high precision mappings,
  batch processing may be the method of choice. This paper reviews first- and second-order
  optimization methods for learning in feedforward neural networks. The viewpoint
  is that of optimization: many methods can be cast in the language of optimization
  techniques, allowing the transfer to neural nets of detailed results about computational
  complexity and safety procedures to ensure convergence and to avoid numerical problems.
  The review is not intended to deliver detailed prescriptions for the most appropriate
  methods in specific applications, but to illustrate the main characteristics of
  the different methods and their mutual relations.'
