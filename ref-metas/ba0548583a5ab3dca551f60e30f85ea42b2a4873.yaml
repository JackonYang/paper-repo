paperAbstract: 'A key ingredient in the design of visual object classification systems
  is the identification of relevant class specific aspects while being robust to intra-class
  variations. While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set
  of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability
  of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance
  gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This
  progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative
  and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features
  based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. In this paper we study
  several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features
  from training data. These include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline
  methods. Furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by Boosting which are easily
  extendable to several multiclass setting. All methods are thoroughly evaluated on
  object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. The key
  results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude
  faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning.
  Furthermore the Boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results
  in all experiments. We provide insight of when combination methods can be expected
  to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently.'
