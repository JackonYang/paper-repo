paperAbstract: "We introduce two Python frameworks to train neural networks on large\
  \ datasets: Blocks and Fuel. Blocks is based on Theano, a linear algebra compiler\
  \ with CUDA-support (Bastien et al., 2012; Bergstra et al., 2010). It facilitates\
  \ the training of complex neural network models by providing parametrized Theano\
  \ operations, attaching metadata to Theano\u2019s symbolic computational graph,\
  \ and providing an extensive set of utilities to assist training the networks, e.g.\
  \ training algorithms, logging, monitoring, visualization, and serialization. Fuel\
  \ provides a standard format for machine learning datasets. It allows the user to\
  \ easily iterate over large datasets, performing many types of pre-processing on\
  \ the fly."
