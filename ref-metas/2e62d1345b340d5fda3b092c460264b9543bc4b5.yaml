paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThis book brings together - in an informal and\
  \ tutorial fashion - the computer techniques, mathematical tools, and research results\
  \ that will enable both students and practitioners to apply genetic algorithms to\
  \ problems in many fields. \n \nMajor concepts are illustrated with running examples,\
  \ and major algorithms are illustrated by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge\
  \ of GAs or genetics is assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and\
  \ mathematics background is required."
