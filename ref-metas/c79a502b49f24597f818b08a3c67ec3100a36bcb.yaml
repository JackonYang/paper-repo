paperAbstract: "In this paper we present a new algorithm for computing Maximally Stable\
  \ Extremal Regions (MSER), as invented by Matas et al. The standard algorithm makes\
  \ use of a union-find data structure and takes quasi-linear time in the number of\
  \ pixels. The new algorithm provides exactly identical results in true worst-case\
  \ linear time. Moreover, the new algorithm uses significantly less memory and has\
  \ better cache-locality, resulting in faster execution. Our CPU implementation performs\
  \ twice as fast as a state-of-the-art FPGA implementation based on the standard\
  \ algorithm. \n \nThe new algorithm is based on a different computational ordering\
  \ of the pixels, which is suggested by another immersion analogy than the one corresponding\
  \ to the standard connected-component algorithm. With the new computational ordering,\
  \ the pixels considered or visited at any point during computation consist of a\
  \ single connected component of pixels in the image, resembling a flood-fill that\
  \ adapts to the grey-level landscape. The computation only needs a priority queue\
  \ of candidate pixels (the boundary of the single connected component), a single\
  \ bit image masking visited pixels, and information for as many components as there\
  \ are grey-levels in the image. This is substantially more compact in practice than\
  \ the standard algorithm, where a large number of connected components must be considered\
  \ in parallel. The new algorithm can also generate the component tree of the image\
  \ in true linear time. The result shows that MSER detection is not tied to the union-find\
  \ data structure, which may open more possibilities for parallelization."
