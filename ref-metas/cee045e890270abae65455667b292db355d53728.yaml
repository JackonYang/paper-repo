paperAbstract: Text documents often contain valuable structured data that is hidden
  Yin regular English sentences. This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational
  table that we could use for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks.We
  explore a technique for extracting such tables from document collections that requires
  only a handful of training examples from users. These examples are used to generate
  extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the
  document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball
  introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text
  documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality
  of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most
  reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation
  methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation
  of Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper
  documents.
