paperAbstract: Table detection is a crucial step in many document analysis applications
  as tables are used for presenting essential information to the reader in a structured
  manner. It is a hard problem due to varying layouts and encodings of the tables.
  Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for table detection based on layout
  analysis of documents. Most of these techniques fail to generalize because they
  rely on hand engineered features which are not robust to layout variations. In this
  paper, we have presented a deep learning based method for table detection. In the
  proposed method, document images are first pre-processed. These images are then
  fed to a Region Proposal Network followed by a fully connected neural network for
  table detection. The proposed method works with high precision on document images
  with varying layouts that include documents, research papers, and magazines. We
  have done our evaluations on publicly available UNLV dataset where it beats Tesseract's
  state of the art table detection system by a significant margin.
