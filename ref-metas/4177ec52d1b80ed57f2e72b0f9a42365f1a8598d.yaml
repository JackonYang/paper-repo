paperAbstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential
  data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification
  make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output
  alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term
  Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art
  results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition
  has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward
  networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine
  the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks
  with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end
  with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve
  a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our
  knowledge is the best recorded score.
