paperAbstract: Conditional maximum entropy (ME) models provide a general purpose machine
  learning technique which has been successfully applied to fields as diverse as computer
  vision and econometrics, and which is used for a wide variety of classification
  problems in natural language processing. However, the flexibility of ME models is
  not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward,
  in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may
  well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number
  of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling,
  gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly,
  the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison
  to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric
  algorithm outperformed the other choices.
