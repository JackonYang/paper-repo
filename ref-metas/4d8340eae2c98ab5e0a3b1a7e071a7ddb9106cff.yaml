paperAbstract: Multiple-instance learning is a variation on supervised learning, where
  the task is to learn a concept given positive and negative bags of instances. Each
  bag may contain many instances, but a bag is labeled positive even if only one of
  the instances in it falls within the concept. A bag is labeled negative only if
  all the instances in it are negative. We describe a new general framework, called
  Diverse Density, for solving multiple-instance learning problems. We apply this
  framework to learn a simple description of a person from a series of images (bags)
  containing that person, to a stock selection problem, and to the drug activity prediction
  problem.
