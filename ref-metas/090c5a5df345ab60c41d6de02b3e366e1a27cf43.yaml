paperAbstract: "Because of the \u201Call-or-none\u201D character of nervous activity,\
  \ neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional\
  \ logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms,\
  \ with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles;\
  \ and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find\
  \ a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices\
  \ among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that\
  \ for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves\
  \ under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.\
  \ Various applications of the calculus are discussed."
