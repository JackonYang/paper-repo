paperAbstract: When a briefly presented real-world scene was jumbled, the accuracy
  of identifying a single, cued object was less than that when the scene was coherent.
  Jumbling remained an effective variable even when the subject knew where to look
  and what to look for. Thus an object's meaningful context may affect the course
  of perceptual recognition and not just peripheral scanning or memory.
