paperAbstract: Text detection in color images has become an active research area in
  the past few decades. In this paper, we present a novel approach to accurately detect
  text in color images possibly with a complex background. The proposed algorithm
  is based on the combination of connected component and texture feature analysis
  of unknown text region contours. First, we utilize an elaborate color image edge
  detection algorithm to extract all possible text edge pixels. Connected component
  analysis is performed on these edge pixels to detect the external contour and possible
  internal contours of potential text regions. The gradient and geometrical characteristics
  of each region contour are carefully examined to construct candidate text regions
  and classify part non-text regions. Then each candidate text region is verified
  with texture features derived from wavelet domain. Finally, the Expectation maximization
  algorithm is introduced to binarize each text region to prepare data for recognition.
  In contrast to previous approach, our algorithm combines both the efficiency of
  connected component based method and robustness of texture based analysis. Experimental
  results show that our proposed algorithm is robust in text detection with respect
  to different character size, orientation, color and language and can provide reliable
  text binarization result.
