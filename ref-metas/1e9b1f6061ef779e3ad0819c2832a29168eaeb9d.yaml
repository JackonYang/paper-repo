paperAbstract: Semantic segmentation research has recently witnessed rapid progress,
  but many leading methods are unable to identify object instances. In this paper,
  we present Multitask Network Cascades for instance-aware semantic segmentation.
  Our model consists of three networks, respectively differentiating instances, estimating
  masks, and categorizing objects. These networks form a cascaded structure, and are
  designed to share their convolutional features. We develop an algorithm for the
  nontrivial end-to-end training of this causal, cascaded structure. Our solution
  is a clean, single-step training framework and can be generalized to cascades that
  have more stages. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance-aware semantic segmentation
  accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Meanwhile, our method takes only 360ms testing an image
  using VGG-16, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous systems for
  this challenging problem. As a by product, our method also achieves compelling object
  detection results which surpass the competitive Fast/Faster R-CNN systems. The method
  described in this paper is the foundation of our submissions to the MS COCO 2015
  segmentation competition, where we won the 1st place.
