paperAbstract: Research and development of OCR systems are considered from a historical
  point of view. The historical development of commercial systems is included. Both
  template matching and structure analysis approaches to R&D are considered. It is
  noted that the two approaches are coming closer and tending to merge. Commercial
  products are divided into three generations, for each of which some representative
  OCR systems are chosen and described in some detail. Some comments are made on recent
  techniques applied to OCR, such as expert systems and neural networks, and some
  open problems are indicated. The authors' views and hopes regarding future trends
  are presented. >
