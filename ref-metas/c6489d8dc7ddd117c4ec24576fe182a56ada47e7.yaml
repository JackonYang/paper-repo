paperAbstract: Weakly supervised discovery of common visual structure in highly variable,
  cluttered images is a key problem in recognition. We address this problem using
  deformable part-based models (DPM's) with latent SVM training [6]. These models
  have been introduced for fully supervised training of object detectors, but we demonstrate
  that they are also capable of more open-ended learning of latent structure for such
  tasks as scene recognition and weakly supervised object localization. For scene
  recognition, DPM's can capture recurring visual elements and salient objects; in
  combination with standard global image features, they obtain state-of-the-art results
  on the MIT 67-category indoor scene dataset. For weakly supervised object localization,
  optimization over latent DPM parameters can discover the spatial extent of objects
  in cluttered training images without ground-truth bounding boxes. The resulting
  method outperforms a recent state-of-the-art weakly supervised object localization
  approach on the PASCAL-07 dataset.
