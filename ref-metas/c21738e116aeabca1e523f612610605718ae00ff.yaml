paperAbstract: Investigates a measure of "dominant perceived orientation" that has
  been developed to match the output of a human study involving 40 subjects. The results
  of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven "teaser" images to test
  its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level
  orientation is then applied to a "quick search" problem important in image database
  applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification
  of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power
  to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective
  behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of
  the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation
  for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely "city/suburb" shots.
  The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of
  98 of the scenes.
