paperAbstract: "The \u03B1-expansion algorithm has had a significant impact in computer\
  \ vision due to its generality, effectiveness, and speed. It is commonly used to\
  \ minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms.\
  \ Our main algorithmic contribution is an extension of \u03B1-expansion that also\
  \ optimizes \u201Clabel costs\u201D with well-characterized optimality bounds. Label\
  \ costs penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it, for example\
  \ by simply penalizing the number of labels in the solution.Our energy has a natural\
  \ interpretation as minimizing description length (MDL) and sheds light on classical\
  \ algorithms like K-means and expectation-maximization (EM). Label costs are useful\
  \ for multi-model fitting and we demonstrate several such applications: homography\
  \ detection, motion segmentation, image segmentation, and compression. Our C++ and\
  \ MATLAB code is publicly available http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/."
