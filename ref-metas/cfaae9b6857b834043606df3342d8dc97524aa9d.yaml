paperAbstract: We present a method for training a similarity metric from data. The
  method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number
  of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number
  of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a
  function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm
  in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The
  method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a
  discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs
  of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping
  from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed
  for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face
  database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression,
  position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.
