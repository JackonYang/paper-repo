paperAbstract: In this paper we present a video text detection system based on automated
  neural network training. Compared with previous work which detects only graphical
  text with fixed parameters, our system (1) provides a training mechanism so the
  parameters of the system can be adapted to changing environments, (2) can detect
  both graphical text and scene text located in complex backgrounds, (3) can detect
  text in any orientation and (4) can perform multilingual text detection. Experiments
  show the effectiveness of our system in various text detection tasks.
