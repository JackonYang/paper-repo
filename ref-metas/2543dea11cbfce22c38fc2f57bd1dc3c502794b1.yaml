paperAbstract: A model for channels in which an input sequence can produce output
  sequences of varying length is described. An efficient computational procedure for
  calculating Pr \{Y\mid X\} is devised, where X = x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_M and Y = y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_N
  are the input and output of the channel. A stack decoding algorithm for decoding
  on such channels is presented. The appropriate likelihood function is derived. Channels
  with memory are considered. Some applications to speech and character recognition
  are discussed.
