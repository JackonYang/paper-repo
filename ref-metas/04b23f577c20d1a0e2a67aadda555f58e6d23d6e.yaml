paperAbstract: 'This book explains the principles that make support vector machines
  (SVMs) a successful modelling and prediction tool for a variety of applications.
  The authors present the basic ideas of SVMs together with the latest developments
  and current research questions in a unified style. They identify three reasons for
  the success of SVMs: their ability to learn well with only a very small number of
  free parameters, their robustness against several types of model violations and
  outliers, and their computational efficiency compared to several other methods.
  Since their appearance in the early nineties, support vector machines and related
  kernel-based methods have been successfully applied in diverse fields of application
  such as bioinformatics, fraud detection, construction of insurance tariffs, direct
  marketing, and data and text mining. As a consequence, SVMs now play an important
  role in statistical machine learning and are used not only by statisticians, mathematicians,
  and computer scientists, but also by engineers and data analysts. The book provides
  a unique in-depth treatment of both fundamental and recent material on SVMs that
  so far has been scattered in the literature. The book can thus serve as both a basis
  for graduate courses and an introduction for statisticians, mathematicians, and
  computer scientists. It further provides a valuable reference for researchers working
  in the field. The book covers all important topics concerning support vector machines
  such as: loss functions and their role in the learning process; reproducing kernel
  Hilbert spaces and their properties; a thorough statistical analysis that uses both
  traditional uniform bounds and more advanced localized techniques based on Rademacher
  averages and Talagrand''s inequality; a detailed treatment of classification and
  regression; a detailed robustness analysis; and a description of some of the most
  recent implementation techniques. To make the book self-contained, an extensive
  appendix is added which provides the reader with the necessary background from statistics,
  probability theory, functional analysis, convex analysis, and topology.'
