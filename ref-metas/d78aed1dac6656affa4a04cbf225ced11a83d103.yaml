paperAbstract: "BERT-based architectures currently give state-of-the-art performance\
  \ on many NLP tasks, but little is known about the exact mechanisms that contribute\
  \ to its success. In the current work, we focus on the interpretation of self-attention,\
  \ which is one of the fundamental underlying components of BERT. Using a subset\
  \ of GLUE tasks and a set of handcrafted features-of-interest, we propose the methodology\
  \ and carry out a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the information encoded\
  \ by the individual BERT\u2019s heads. Our findings suggest that there is a limited\
  \ set of attention patterns that are repeated across different heads, indicating\
  \ the overall model overparametrization. While different heads consistently use\
  \ the same attention patterns, they have varying impact on performance across different\
  \ tasks. We show that manually disabling attention in certain heads leads to a performance\
  \ improvement over the regular fine-tuned BERT models."
