paperAbstract: "Simple cells in the primary visual cortex process incoming visual\
  \ information with receptive fields localized in space and time, bandpass in spatial\
  \ and temporal frequency, tuned in orientation, and commonly selective for the direction\
  \ of movement. It is shown that performing independent component analysis (ICA)\
  \ on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with qualitatively similar\
  \ spatio-temporal properties. Whereas the independent components of video resemble\
  \ moving edges or bars, the independent component filters, i.e. the analogues of\
  \ receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids windowed by steady Gaussian envelopes.\
  \ Contrary to earlier ICA results on static images, which gave only filters at the\
  \ finest possible spatial scale, the spatio\u2013temporal analysis yields filters\
  \ at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Filters centred at low spatial frequencies\
  \ are generally tuned to faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies."
