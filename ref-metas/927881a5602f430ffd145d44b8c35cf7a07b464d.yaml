paperAbstract: "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been\
  \ given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following\
  \ the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric\
  \ optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not\
  \ all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra\
  \ exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months\
  \ or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical\
  \ approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201CElementary Supernova\u201D\
  \ model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically\
  \ thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting\
  \ non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying\
  \ 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary\
  \ for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate\
  \ spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results\
  \ from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in\
  \ line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like\
  \ profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward,\
  \ respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite\
  \ the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta.\
  \ These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification\
  \ of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric\
  \ times in SN optical spectra."
