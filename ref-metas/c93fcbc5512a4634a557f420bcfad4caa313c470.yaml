paperAbstract: We consider the problem of recognizing human actions from still images.
  We propose a novel approach that treats the pose of the person in the image as latent
  variables that will help with recognition. Different from other work that learns
  separate systems for pose estimation and action recognition, then combines them
  in an ad-hoc fashion, our system is trained in an integrated fashion that jointly
  considers poses and actions. Our learning objective is designed to directly exploit
  the pose information for action recognition. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that by inferring the latent poses, we can improve the final action recognition
  results.
