paperAbstract: This paper collects some ideas targeted at advancing our understanding
  of the feature spaces associated with support vector (SV) kernel functions. We first
  discuss the geometry of feature space. In particular, we review what is known about
  the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this
  influences the capacity of SV methods. Following this, we describe how the metric
  governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms
  of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels,
  which are often used in SV pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between
  feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given
  some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space.
  We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications
  of kernel methods. First, we use it to reduce the computational complexity of SV
  decision functions; second, we combine it with the Kernel PCA algorithm, thereby
  constructing a nonlinear statistical denoising technique which is shown to perform
  well on real-world data.
