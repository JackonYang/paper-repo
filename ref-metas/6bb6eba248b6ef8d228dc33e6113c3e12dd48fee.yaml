paperAbstract: The extraction of stereo-disparity information from two images depends
  upon establishing a correspondence between them. In this article we analyze the
  nature of the correspondence computation and derive a cooperative algorithm that
  implements it. We show that this algorithm successfully extracts information from
  random-dot stereograms, and its implications for the psychophysics and neurophysiology
  of the visual system are briefly discussed.
