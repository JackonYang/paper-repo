paperAbstract: 'Bottom-up approaches, which rely mainly on continuity principles,
  are often insufficient to form accurate segments in natural images. In order to
  improve performance, recent methods have begun to incorporate top-down cues, or
  object information, into segmentation. In this paper, we propose an approach to
  utilizing category-based information in segmentation, through a formulation as an
  image labelling problem. Our approach exploits bottom-up image cues to create an
  over-segmented representation of an image. The segments are then merged by assigning
  labels that correspond to the object category. The model is trained on a database
  of images, and is designed to be modular: it learns a number of image contexts,
  which simplify training and extend the range of object classes and image database
  size that the system can handle. The learning method estimates model parameters
  by maximizing a lower bound of the data likelihood. We examine performance on three
  real-world image databases, and compare our system to a standard classifier and
  other conditional random field approaches, as well as a bottom-up segmentation method.'
