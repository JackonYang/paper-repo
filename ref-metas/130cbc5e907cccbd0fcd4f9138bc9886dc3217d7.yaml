paperAbstract: "There is a wealth of information to be mined from narrative text on\
  \ the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, standard natural language processing (NLP)\
  \ extraction techniques expect full, grammatical sentences, and perform poorly on\
  \ the choppy sentence fragments that are often found on web pages. \n \nThis paper1\
  \ introduces Webfoot, a preprocessor that parses web pages into logically coherent\
  \ segments based on page layout cues. Output from Webfoot is then passed on to CRYSTAL,\
  \ an NLP system that learns text extraction rules from example. Webfoot and CRYSTAL\
  \ transform the text into a formal representation that is equivalent to relational\
  \ database entries. This is a necessary first step for knowledge discovery and other\
  \ automated analysis of free text."
