paperAbstract: Dense random fields are models in which all pairs of variables are
  directly connected by pairwise potentials. It has recently been shown that mean
  field inference in dense random fields can be performed efficiently and that these
  models enable significant accuracy gains in computer vision applications. However,
  parameter estimation for dense random fields is still poorly understood. In this
  paper, we present an efficient algorithm for learning parameters in dense random
  fields. All parameters are estimated jointly, thus capturing dependencies between
  them. We show that gradients of a variety of loss functions over the mean field
  marginals can be computed efficiently. The resulting algorithm learns parameters
  that directly optimize the performance of mean field inference in the model. As
  a supporting result, we present an efficient inference algorithm for dense random
  fields that is guaranteed to converge.
