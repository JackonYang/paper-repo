paperAbstract: A rule-based system for automatically segmenting a document image into
  regions of text and nontext is presented. The initial stages of the system perform
  image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing,
  and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing
  the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected
  components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based
  on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character
  reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted
  and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic
  steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available),
  and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>
