paperAbstract: We propose a novel algorithm for visual question answering based on
  a recurrent deep neural network, where every module in the network corresponds to
  a complete answering unit with attention mechanism by itself. The network is optimized
  by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model parameters while
  receiving different information to compute attention probability. For training,
  our model attends to a region within image feature map, updates its memory based
  on the question and attended image feature, and answers the question based on its
  memory state. This procedure is performed to compute loss in each step. The motivation
  of this approach is our observation that multi-step inferences are often required
  to answer questions while each problem may have a unique desirable number of steps,
  which is difficult to identify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit
  in the network solve problems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest
  of units by backpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea,
  we early-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since
  more complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last answering
  unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed first while the
  first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a new question using
  the shared model. This strategy works better than the other options within our framework
  since the selected model is trained effectively from all units without overfitting.
  The proposed algorithm outperforms other multi-step attention based approaches using
  a single step prediction in VQA dataset.
