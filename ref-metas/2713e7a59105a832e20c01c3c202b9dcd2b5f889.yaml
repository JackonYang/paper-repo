paperAbstract: Many different low-level feature detectors exist and it is widely agreed
  that the evaluation of detectors is important. In this paper we introduce two evaluation
  criteria for interest points' repeatability rate and information content. Repeatability
  rate evaluates the geometric stability under different transformations. Information
  content measures the distinctiveness of features. Different interest point detectors
  are compared using these two criteria. We determine which detector gives the best
  results and show that it satisfies the criteria well.
