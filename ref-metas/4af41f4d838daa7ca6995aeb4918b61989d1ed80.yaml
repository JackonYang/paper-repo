paperAbstract: 'Maximum entropy models are considered by many to be one of the most
  promising avenues of language modeling research. Unfortunately, long training times
  make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change
  the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum
  entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second
  of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero
  indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor
  of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly
  lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine
  learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number
  of outputs, such as language modeling.'
