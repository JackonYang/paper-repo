paperAbstract: IN A SERIES OF STUDIES on the cat over the past 5 years we have recorded
  from single cells in the striate cortex and mapped receptive fields using patterned
  retinal stimulation. The results suggest that connections between geniculate and
  striate cortex, and between cortical cells, must be highly specific (5). Indeed,
  cells in the striate cortex respond in such a characteristic way that departures
  from the normal adult physiology should be easily recognizable. In the present study
  we have made similar experiments in kittens ranging in age from l-3 weeks. Our purpose
  was to learn the age at which cortical cells have normal, adult-type receptive fields,
  and to find out whether such fields exist even in animals that have had no patterned
  visual stimulation.
