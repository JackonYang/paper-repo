paperAbstract: Convergence properties of empirically estimated neural networks are
  examined. In this theory, an appropriate size feedforward network is automatically
  determined from the data. The networks studied include two- and three-layer networks
  with an increasing number of simple sigmoidal nodes, multiple-layer polynomial networks,
  and networks with certain fixed structures but an increasing complexity in each
  unit. Each of these classes of networks is dense in the space of continuous functions
  on compact subsets of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with respect to the topology
  of uniform convergence. It is shown how, with the use of an appropriate complexity
  regularization criterion, the statistical risk of network estimators converges to
  zero as the sample size increases. Bounds on the rate of convergence are given in
  terms of an index of the approximation capability of the class of networks.<<ETX>>
