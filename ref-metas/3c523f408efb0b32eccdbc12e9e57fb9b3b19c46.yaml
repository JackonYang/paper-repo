paperAbstract: 'IN THE LAST DEC,ADE, considerable progress has been made in understanding
  the physiology of one of the most fundamental aspects of human experience: perception
  of the visual world. It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not
  simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even
  at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their
  presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate
  visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such
  that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to
  increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area
  of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby
  individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions
  of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual
  information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells
  that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis?
  There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further
  processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information
  might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity
  of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex
  which itself processes visual information received from'
