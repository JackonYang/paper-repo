paperAbstract: Methods of deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated superior
  performance on a number of natural language processing tasks. However, in most previous
  work, the models are learned based on either unsupervised objectives, which does
  not directly optimize the desired task, or singletask supervised objectives, which
  often suffer from insufficient training data. We develop a multi-task DNN for learning
  representations across multiple tasks, not only leveraging large amounts of cross-task
  data, but also benefiting from a regularization effect that leads to more general
  representations to help tasks in new domains. Our multi-task DNN approach combines
  tasks of multiple-domain classification (for query classification) and information
  retrieval (ranking for web search), and demonstrates significant gains over strong
  baselines in a comprehensive set of domain adaptation.
