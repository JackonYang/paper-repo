paperAbstract: "Recent computational and psychological theories of human texture vision1\u2013\
  3 assert that texture discrimination is based on first-order differences in geometric\
  \ and luminance attributes of texture elements, called 'textons'4. Significant differences\
  \ in the density, orientation, size, or contrast of line segments or other small\
  \ features in an image have been shown to cause immediate perception of texture\
  \ boundaries. However, the psychological theories, which are based on the perception\
  \ of synthetic images composed of lines and symbols, neglect two important issues.\
  \ First, how can textons be computed from grey-level images of natural scenes? And\
  \ second, how, exactly, can texture boundaries be found? Our analysis of these two\
  \ issues has led to an algorithm that is fully implemented and which successfully\
  \ detects boundaries in natural images5. We propose that blobs computed by a centre-surround\
  \ operator are useful as texture elements, and that a simple non-parametric statistic\
  \ can be used to compare local distributions of blob attributes to locate texture\
  \ boundaries. Although designed for natural images, our computation agrees with\
  \ some psycho-physical findings, in particular, those of Adelson and Bergen (described\
  \ in the preceding article6), which cast doubt on the hypothesis that line segment\
  \ crossings or termination points are textons."
