paperAbstract: Text in curve orientation, despite being one of the common text orientations
  in real world environment, has close to zero existence in well received scene text
  datasets such as ICDAR'13 and MSRA-TD500. The main motivation of Total-Text is to
  fill this gap and facilitate a new research direction for the scene text community.
  On top of conventional horizontal and multi-oriented text, it features curved-oriented
  text. Total-Text is highly diversified in orientations, more than half of its images
  have a combination of more than two orientations. Recently, a new breed of solutions
  that casted text detection as a segmentation problem has demonstrated their effectiveness
  against multi-oriented text. In order to evaluate its robustness against curved
  text, we fine-tuned DeconvNet and benchmark it on Total-Text. Total-Text with its
  annotation is available at https://github.com/cs-chan/Total-Text-Dataset.
