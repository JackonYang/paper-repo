paperAbstract: This paper defines the difference of low-pass (DOLP) transform and
  describes a fast algorithm for its computation. The DOLP is a reversible transform
  which converts an image into a set of bandpass images. A DOLP transform is shown
  to require O(N2) multiplies and produce O(N log(N)) samples from an N sample image.
  When Gaussian low-pass filters are used, the result is a set of images which have
  been convolved with difference of Gaussian (DOG) filters from an exponential set
  of sizes. A fast computation technique based on ``resampling'' is described and
  shown to reduce the DOLP transform complexity to O(N log(N)) multiplies and O(N)
  storage locations. A second technique, ``cascaded convolution with expansion,''
  is then defined and also shown to reduce the computational cost to O(N log(N)) multiplies.
  Combining these two techniques yields an algorithm for a DOLP transform that requires
  O(N) storage cells and requires O(N) multiplies.
