paperAbstract: "Sex identification in animals has biological importance. Humans are\
  \ good at making this determination visually, but machines have not matched this\
  \ ability. A neural network was trained to discriminate sex in human faces, and\
  \ performed as well as humans on a set of 90 exemplars. Images sampled at 30\xD7\
  30 were compressed using a 900\xD740\xD7900 fully-connected back-propagation network;\
  \ activities of hidden units served as input to a back-propagation \"SexNet\" trained\
  \ to produce values of 1 for male and 0 for female faces. The network's average\
  \ error rate of 8.1% compared favorably to humans, who averaged 11.6%. Some SexNet\
  \ errors mimicked those of humans."
