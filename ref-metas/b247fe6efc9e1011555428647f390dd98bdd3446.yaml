paperAbstract: Error propagation nets have been shown to be able to learn a variety
  of tasks in which a static input pattern is mapped onto a static output pattern.
  This paper presents a generalisation of these nets to deal with time varying, or
  dynamic patterns, and three possible architectures are explored. As an example,
  dynamic nets are applied to the problem of speech coding, in which a time sequence
  of speech data are coded by one net and decoded by another. The use of dynamic nets
  gives a better signal to noise ratio than that achieved using static nets.
