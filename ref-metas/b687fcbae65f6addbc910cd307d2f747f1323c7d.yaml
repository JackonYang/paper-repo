paperAbstract: 'In this paper we propose an unsupervised segmentation-free method
  for word spotting in document images. Documents are represented with a grid of HOG
  descriptors, and a sliding window approach is used to locate the document regions
  that are most similar to the query. We use the Exemplar SVM framework to produce
  a better representation of the query in an unsupervised way. Finally, the document
  descriptors are precomputed and compressed with Product Quantization. This offers
  two advantages: first, a large number of documents can be kept in RAM memory at
  the same time. Second, the sliding window becomes significantly faster since distances
  between quantized HOG descriptors can be precomputed. Our results significantly
  outperform other segmentation-free methods in the literature, both in accuracy and
  in speed and memory usage.'
