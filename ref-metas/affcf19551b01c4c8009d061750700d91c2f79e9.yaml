paperAbstract: A classic introduction to artificial intelligence intended to bridge
  the gap between theory and practice, "Principles of Artificial Intelligence" describes
  fundamental AI ideas that underlie applications such as natural language processing,
  automatic programming, robotics, machine vision, automatic theorem proving, and
  intelligent data retrieval. Rather than focusing on the subject matter of the applications,
  the book is organized around general computational concepts involving the kinds
  of data structures used, the types of operations performed on the data structures,
  and the properties of the control strategies used. "Principles of Artificial Intelligence"evolved
  from the author's courses and seminars at Stanford University and University of
  Massachusetts, Amherst, and is suitable for text use in a senior or graduate AI
  course, or for individual study.
