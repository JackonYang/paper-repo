paperAbstract: Region-based image segmentation techniques make use of similarity in
  intensity, color and texture to determine the partitioning of an image. The powerful
  cue of contour continuity is not exploited at all. In this paper, we provide a way
  of incorporating curvilinear grouping into region-based image segmentation. Soft
  contour information is obtained through orientation energy. Weak contrast gaps and
  subjective contours are completed by contour propagation. The normalized cut approach
  proposed by Shi and Malik is used for the segmentation. Results on a large variety
  of images are shown.
