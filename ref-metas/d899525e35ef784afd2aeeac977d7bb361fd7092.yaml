paperAbstract: 'Text detection and recognition in a natural environment are key components
  of many applications, ranging from business card digitization to shop indexation
  in a street. This competition aims at assessing the ability of state-of-the-art
  methods to detect Multi-Lingual Text (MLT) in scene images, such as in contents
  gathered from the Internet media and in modern cities where multiple cultures live
  and communicate together. This competition is an extension of the Robust Reading
  Competition (RRC) which has been held since 2003 both in ICDAR and in an online
  context. The proposed competition is presented as a new challenge of the RRC. The
  dataset built for this challenge largely extends the previous RRC editions in many
  aspects: the multi-lingual text, the size of the dataset, the multi-oriented text,
  the wide variety of scenes. The dataset is comprised of 18,000 images which contain
  text belonging to 9 languages. The challenge is comprised of three tasks related
  to text detection and script classification. We have received a total of 16 participations
  from the research and industrial communities. This paper presents the dataset, the
  tasks and the findings of this RRC-MLT challenge.'
