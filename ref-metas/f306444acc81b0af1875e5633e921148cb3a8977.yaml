paperAbstract: 'A basic and extensive treatment of discrete aspects of the scale-space
  theory is presented. A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its
  connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention
  is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous
  scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved
  completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how
  the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows:
  the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete
  images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral;
  the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with
  the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation
  based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational
  problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations
  can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support
  1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent
  elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric
  1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial
  and the frequency domain. >'
