paperAbstract: We present an energy-based model that uses a product of generalized
  Student-t distributions to capture the statistical structure in data sets. This
  model is inspired by and particularly applicable to natural data sets such as images.
  We begin by providing the mathematical framework, where we discuss complete and
  overcomplete models and provide algorithms for training these models from data.
  Using patches of natural scenes, we demonstrate that our approach represents a viable
  alternative to independent component analysis as an interpretive model of biological
  visual systems. Although the two approaches are similar in flavor, there are also
  important differences, particularly when the representations are overcomplete. By
  constraining the interactions within our model, we are also able to study the topographic
  organization of Gabor-like receptive fields that our model learns. Finally, we discuss
  the relation of our new approach to previous workin particular, gaussian scale mixture
  models and variants of independent components analysis.
