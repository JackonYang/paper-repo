paperAbstract: 'This article shows a relationship between two different approximation
  techniques: the support vector machines (SVM), proposed by V. Vapnik (1995) and
  a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the basis pursuit denoising algorithm
  (Chen, 1995; Chen, Donoho, & Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique that can be derived
  from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to
  estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial
  basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms
  of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique
  in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions
  chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless,
  the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent
  to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques
  give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming
  problem. In the appendix, we present a derivation of the SVM technique in the framework
  of regularization theory, rather than statistical learning theory, establishing
  a connection between SVM, sparse approximation, and regularization theory.'
