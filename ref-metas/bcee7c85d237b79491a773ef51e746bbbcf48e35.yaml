paperAbstract: The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference
  from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications.
  This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used
  in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results
  from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with
  information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic
  algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes
  with illustrations of current research directions.
