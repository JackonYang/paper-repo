paperAbstract: 'We present a simple and scalable algorithm for clustering tens of
  millions of phrases and use the resulting clusters as features in discriminative
  classifiers. To demonstrate the power and generality of this approach, we apply
  the method in two very different applications: named entity recognition and query
  classification. Our results show that phrase clusters offer significant improvements
  over word clusters. Our NER system achieves the best current result on the widely
  used CoNLL benchmark. Our query classifier is on par with the best system in KDDCUP
  2005 without resorting to labor intensive knowledge engineering efforts.'
