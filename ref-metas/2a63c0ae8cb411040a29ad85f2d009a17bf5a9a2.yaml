paperAbstract: 'We present a method to recognize hand gestures, based on a pattern
  recognition technique developed by McConnell [16] employing histograms of local
  orientation. We use the orientation histogram as a feature vector for gesture class
  cation and interpolation. This method is simple and fast to compute, and o ers some
  robustness to scene illumination changes. We have implemented a real-time version,
  which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 di erent hand gestures. All
  the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize
  the image. A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control,
  or play a game. We discuss limitations of this method. For moving or \dynamic gestures",
  the histogram of the spatio-temporal gradients of image intensity form the analogous
  feature vector and may be useful for dynamic gesture recognition. Reprinted from:
