paperAbstract: Feature descriptors play a crucial role in a wide range of geometry
  analysis and processing applications, including shape correspondence, retrieval,
  and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Convolutional Neural Networks
  (GCNN), a generalization of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) paradigm to
  non-Euclidean manifolds. Our construction is based on a local geodesic system of
  polar coordinates to extract "patches", which are then passed through a cascade
  of filters and linear and non-linear operators. The coefficients of the filters
  and linear combination weights are optimization variables that are learned to minimize
  a task-specific cost function. We use ShapeNet to learn invariant shape features,
  allowing to achieve state-of-the-art performance in problems such as shape description,
  retrieval, and correspondence.
