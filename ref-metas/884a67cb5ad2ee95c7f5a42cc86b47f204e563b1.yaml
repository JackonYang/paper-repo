paperAbstract: "The goal of document image structure analysis is to find an optimal\
  \ solution partitioning the set of glyphs on a given document image into a hierarchical\
  \ tree structure where entities within the hierarchy are associated with their physical\
  \ properties and semantic labels. In this dissertation, we present a unified document\
  \ image structure extraction algorithm that is probability based, where the probabilities\
  \ are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements\
  \ of distances between the terminal and non-terminal entities with which the algorithm\
  \ works. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions\
  \ in the on-line segmentation module. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used\
  \ to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. This approach\
  \ can be uniformly apply to the construction of the document hierarchy at any level.\
  \ We have implemented a text line segmentation algorithm and a text block extraction\
  \ algorithm using this framework. Another example is the development of a system\
  \ that detects and recognizes special symbols (Greek letters, mathematical symbols,\
  \ etc.) on technical document pages, that are not handled by the current Optical\
  \ Character Recognition (OCR) systems. \nA large quantity of ground-truth data,\
  \ varying in quality, is required in order to give an accurate measurement of the\
  \ performance of an algorithm under different conditions. \nWe have constructed\
  \ the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III, which contains\
  \ 1600 scanned scientific/technical document image pages that come with manually\
  \ edited ground-truth of entity bounding boxes and properties. Based on the ground-truth\
  \ data, we can evaluate the performance of document analysis algorithms and build\
  \ statistical models to characterize various types of document image structures.\
  \ In this dissertation, we present a set of quantitative performance metrics for\
  \ each kind of information a document image analysis technique infers. The text\
  \ line and text block extraction algorithms were trained and evaluated on the UW-III\
  \ database using a cross-validation method. The text line extraction algorithm identifies\
  \ and segments 99.76% of text lines correctly, while the preliminary result of the\
  \ text block extraction shows 91% accuracy."
