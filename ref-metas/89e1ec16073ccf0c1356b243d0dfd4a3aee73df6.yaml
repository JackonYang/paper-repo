paperAbstract: A k-poselet is a deformable part model (DPM) with k parts, where each
  of the parts is a poselet, aligned to a specific configuration of keypoints based
  on ground-truth annotations. A separate template is used to learn the appearance
  of each part. The parts are allowed to move with respect to each other with a deformation
  cost that is learned at training time. This model is richer than both the traditional
  version of poselets and DPMs. It enables a unified approach to person detection
  and keypoint prediction which, barring contemporaneous approaches based on CNN features,
  achieves state-of-the-art keypoint prediction while maintaining competitive detection
  performance.
