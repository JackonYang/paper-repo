paperAbstract: "Abstract This paper describes a computer system for understanding\
  \ English. The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information\
  \ in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language\
  \ understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014\
  syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar\
  \ of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system.\
  \ We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand\
  \ the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model\
  \ of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own\
  \ mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying\
  \ them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences\
  \ with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic\
  \ programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic,\
  \ contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in\
  \ the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing\
  \ special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain\
  \ flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can\
  \ call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."
