paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a stereo matching algorithm using the dynamic
  programming technique. The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence
  between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo
  images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the
  same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search
  can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D)
  search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges
  in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline
  search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search
  planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses
  edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned
  two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected
  edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences
  of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for
  both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency
  constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former.
  An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm
  has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized
  images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed.'
