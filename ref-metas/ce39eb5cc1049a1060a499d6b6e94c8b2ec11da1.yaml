paperAbstract: This paper describes the robust reading competitions forICDAR 2003.
  With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in
  natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets,
  and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust
  reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR
  packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems,
  and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem.
  The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By
  breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of
  the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring
  detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing
  researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext
  locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this
  contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail.
