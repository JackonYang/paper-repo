paperAbstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks
  to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has
  been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of
  Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the
  current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large
  datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such
  datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract
  level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level cognitive functions such
  as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally,
  their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains
  in which verifiability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement
  learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with
  the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-of-concept, we present
  a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants
  of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system -- though just a prototype
  -- learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily
  comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural
  DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.
