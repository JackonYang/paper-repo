paperAbstract: We propose a theory of the early processing in the mammalian visual
  pathway. The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes
  that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy
  subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved.
  In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy
  reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when
  noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve
  the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed
  within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution
  for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs,
  namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with
  the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise.
