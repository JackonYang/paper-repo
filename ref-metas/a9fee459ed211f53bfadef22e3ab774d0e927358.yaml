paperAbstract: 'Computing semantic relatedness of natural language texts requires
  access to vast amounts of common-sense and domain-specific world knowledge. We propose
  Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of
  texts in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia. We use machine
  learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as a weighted
  vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space
  amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g.,
  cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial
  improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments:
  from r = 0.56 to 0.75 for individual words and from r = 0.60 to 0.72 for texts.
  Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain
  to human users.'
