paperAbstract: "In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN\
  \ Encoder\u2010 Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One\
  \ RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and\
  \ the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder\
  \ and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional\
  \ probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a\
  \ statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using\
  \ the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder\u2010\
  Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively,\
  \ we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful\
  \ representation of linguistic phrases."
