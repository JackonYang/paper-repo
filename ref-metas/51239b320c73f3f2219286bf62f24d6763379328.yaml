paperAbstract: 'In recent years, the problem of associating a sentence with an image
  has gained a lot of attention. This work continues to push the envelope and makes
  further progress in the performance of image annotation and image search by a sentence
  tasks. In this work, we are using the Fisher Vector as a sentence representation
  by pooling the word2vec embedding of each word in the sentence. The Fisher Vector
  is typically taken as the gradients of the log-likelihood of descriptors, with respect
  to the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In this work we present two
  other Mixture Models and derive their Expectation-Maximization and Fisher Vector
  expressions. The first is a Laplacian Mixture Model (LMM), which is based on the
  Laplacian distribution. The second Mixture Model presented is a Hybrid Gaussian-Laplacian
  Mixture Model (HGLMM) which is based on a weighted geometric mean of the Gaussian
  and Laplacian distribution. Finally, by using the new Fisher Vectors derived from
  HGLMMs to represent sentences, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both the
  image annotation and the image search by a sentence tasks on four benchmarks: Pascal1K,
  Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and COCO.'
