paperAbstract: 'Text information in natural scene images serves as important clues
  for many image-based applications such as scene understanding, content-based image
  retrieval, assistive navigation, and automatic geocoding. However, locating text
  from a complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper,
  we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in
  complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework of text string detection consists
  of two steps: 1) image partition to find text character candidates based on local
  gradient features and color uniformity of character components and 2) character
  candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features of
  text characters in each text string such as character size differences, distances
  between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text
  string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms of text string detection:
  1) adjacent character grouping method and 2) text line grouping method. The adjacent
  character grouping method calculates the sibling groups of each character candidate
  as string segments and then merges the intersecting sibling groups into text string.
  The text line grouping method performs Hough transform to fit text line among the
  centroids of text candidates. Each fitted text line describes the orientation of
  a potential text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region
  covering all characters whose centroids are cascaded in its text line. To improve
  efficiency and accuracy, our algorithms are carried out in multi-scales. The proposed
  methods outperform the state-of-the-art results on the public Robust Reading Dataset,
  which contains text only in horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the effectiveness
  of our methods to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations is evaluated on
  the Oriented Scene Text Dataset collected by ourselves containing text strings in
  nonhorizontal orientations.'
