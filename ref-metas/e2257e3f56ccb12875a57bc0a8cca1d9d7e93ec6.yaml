paperAbstract: 'We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method
  to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting
  representations are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations
  are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed
  as a nonlinear extension of the linear method canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
  It is an alternative to the nonparametric method kernel canonical correlation analysis
  (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does
  not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training
  time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when
  computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world
  datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation
  than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid
  function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward
  neural networks.'
