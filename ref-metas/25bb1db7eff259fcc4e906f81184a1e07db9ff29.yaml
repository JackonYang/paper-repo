paperAbstract: This paper presents an approach to object detection which is based
  on recent work in statistical models for texture synthesis and recognition. Our
  method follows the texture recognition work of De Bonet and Viola (1998). We use
  feature vectors which capture the joint occurrence of local features at multiple
  resolutions. The distribution of feature vectors for a set of training images of
  an object class is estimated by clustering the data and then forming a mixture of
  Gaussian models. The mixture model is further refined by determining which clusters
  are the most discriminative for the class and retaining only those clusters. After
  the model is learned, test images are classified by computing the likelihood of
  their feature vectors with respect to the model. We present promising results in
  applying our technique to face detection and car detection.
