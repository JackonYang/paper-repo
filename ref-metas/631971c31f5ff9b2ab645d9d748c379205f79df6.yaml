paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an incremental frame-work for extracting
  information fields from administrative documents. First, we demonstrate some limits
  of the existing state-of-the-art methods such as the delay of the system efficiency.
  This is a concern in industrial context when we have only few samples of each document
  class. Based on this analysis, we propose a hybrid system combining incremental
  learning by means of itf-df statistics and a-priori generic models. We report in
  the experimental section our results obtained with a dataset of real invoices.
