paperAbstract: There is plenty of theoretical and empirical evidence that depth of
  neural networks is a crucial ingredient for their success. However, network training
  becomes more difficult with increasing depth and training of very deep networks
  remains an open problem. In this extended abstract, we introduce a new architecture
  designed to ease gradient-based training of very deep networks. We refer to networks
  with this architecture as highway networks, since they allow unimpeded information
  flow across several layers on information highways. The architecture is characterized
  by the use of gating units which learn to regulate the flow of information through
  a network. Highway networks with hundreds of layers can be trained directly using
  stochastic gradient descent and with a variety of activation functions, opening
  up the possibility of studying extremely deep and efficient architectures.
