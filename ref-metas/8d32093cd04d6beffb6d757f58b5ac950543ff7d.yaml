paperAbstract: Visual codebook based quantization of robust appearance descriptors
  extracted from local image patches is an effective means of capturing image statistics
  for texture analysis and scene classification. Codebooks are usually constructed
  by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled
  either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or
  salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis
  in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks
  have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts
  to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in
  descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives
  suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe
  a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and
  study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense
  representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that
  SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook
  further improves the performance.
