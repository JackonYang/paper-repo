paperAbstract: The unifying purpose of the abstract dynamic programming models is
  to find sufficient conditions on the recursive definition of the objective function
  that guarantee the validity of the dynamic programming iteration. This paper presents
  backward, forward, and backward-forward models that weaken previous sufficient conditions
  and that include, but are not restricted to, optimization problems. The backward-forward
  model is devoted to the simultaneous solution of a collection of interrelated sequential
  problems based on the independent computation of a cost-to-arrive function and a
  cost-to-go function. Several extremization and nonextremization problems illustrate
  the applicability of the proposed models.
