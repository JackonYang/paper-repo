paperAbstract: Table is a commonly used presentation scheme for describing relational
  information. Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including
  web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to
  narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked
  as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence
  of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding
  in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we
  designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and
  corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we
  investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be
  automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the
  layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is
  tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds
  of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table?
  elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine
  learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure
  of 95.88%.
