paperAbstract: The authors present an algorithm to adapt a n-gram language model to
  a document as it is dictated. The observed partial document is used to estimate
  a unigram distribution for the words that already occurred. Then, they find the
  closest n-gram distribution to the static n-gram distribution (using the discrimination
  information distance measure) that satisfies the marginal constraints derived from
  the document. The resulting minimum discrimination information model results in
  a perplexity of 208 instead of 290 for the static trigram model on a document of
  321 words.<<ETX>>
