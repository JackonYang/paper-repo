paperAbstract: We extend the work of Black and Yacoob (1995) on the tracking and recognition
  of human facial expressions using parametrized models of optical flow to deal with
  the articulated motion of human limbs. We define a "card-board person model" in
  which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The
  parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated
  motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered
  motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can
  be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition
  of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods
  to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with
  examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences.
