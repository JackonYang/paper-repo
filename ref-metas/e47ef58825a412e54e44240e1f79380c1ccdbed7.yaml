paperAbstract: This paper presents a novel scene text detection algorithm, Canny Text
  Detector, which takes advantage of the similarity between image edge and text for
  effective text localization with improved recall rate. As closely related edge pixels
  construct the structural information of an object, we observe that cohesive characters
  compose a meaningful word/sentence sharing similar properties such as spatial location,
  size, color, and stroke width regardless of language. However, prevalent scene text
  detection approaches have not fully utilized such similarity, but mostly rely on
  the characters classified with high confidence, leading to low recall rate. By exploiting
  the similarity, our approach can quickly and robustly localize a variety of texts.
  Inspired by the original Canny edge detector, our algorithm makes use of double
  threshold and hysteresis tracking to detect texts of low confidence. Experimental
  results on public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of
  the-art scene text detection methods in terms of detection rate.
