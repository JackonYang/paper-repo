paperAbstract: The performance of feedforward neural networks in real applications
  can often be improved significantly if use is made of a priori information. For
  interpolation problems this prior knowledge frequently includes smoothness requirements
  on the network mapping, and can be imposed by the addition to the error function
  of suitable regularization terms. The new error function, however, now depends on
  the derivatives of the network mapping, and so the standard backpropagation algorithm
  cannot be applied. In this letter, we derive a computationally efficient learning
  algorithm, for a feedforward network of arbitrary topology, which can be used to
  minimize such error functions. Networks having a single hidden layer, for which
  the learning algorithm simplifies, are treated as a special case.
