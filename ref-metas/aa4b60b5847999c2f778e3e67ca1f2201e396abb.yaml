paperAbstract: An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing.
  The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages
  of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive
  but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description
  is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE,
  LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description,
  specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS.
  This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it
  is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy.
  The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents
  in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret
  drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual
  equipment of symbolic processes that can define "place-tokens" in an image in various
  ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail
  to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms
  of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements
  in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes
  inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations
  acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing
  information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued
  that "non-attentive" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations
  and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations
  so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity
  array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts
  to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation
  can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image
  in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description
  of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and
  purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing.
  This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage
  than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge
  should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing
  that is taking place lower down.
