paperAbstract: We present the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million Dataset (YFCC100M),
  the largest public multimedia collection that has ever been released. The dataset
  contains a total of 100 million media objects, of which approximately 99.2 million
  are photos and 0.8 million are videos, all of which carry a Creative Commons license.
  Each media object in the dataset is represented by several pieces of metadata, e.g.
  Flickr identifier, owner name, camera, title, tags, geo, media source. The collection
  provides a comprehensive snapshot of how photos and videos were taken, described,
  and shared over the years, from the inception of Flickr in 2004 until early 2014.
  In this article we explain the rationale behind its creation, as well as the implications
  the dataset has for science, research, engineering, and development. We further
  present several new challenges in multimedia research that can now be expanded upon
  with our dataset.
