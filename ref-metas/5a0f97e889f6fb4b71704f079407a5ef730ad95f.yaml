paperAbstract: 'Two view-based object recognition algorithms are compared: (1) a heuristic
  algorithm based on oriented filters, and (2) a support vector learning machine trained
  on low-resolution images of the objects. Classification performance is assessed
  using a high number of images generated by a computer graphics system under precisely
  controlled conditions. Training- and test-images show a set of 25 realistic three-dimensional
  models of chairs from viewing directions spread over the upper half of the viewing
  sphere. The percentage of correct identification of all 25 objects is measured.'
