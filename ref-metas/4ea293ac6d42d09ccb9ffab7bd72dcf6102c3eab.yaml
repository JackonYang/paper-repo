paperAbstract: In order to best understand a visual system one should attempt to characterize
  the natural images it processes. We gather images from the woods and find that these
  scenes possess an ensemble scale invariance. Further, they are highly non-Gaussian,
  and this non-Gaussian character cannot be removed through local linear filtering.
  We find that including a simple "gain control" nonlinearity in the filtering process
  makes the filter output quite Gaussian, meaning information is maximized at fixed
  channel variance. Finally, we use the measured power spectrum to place an upper
  bound on the information conveyed about natural scenes by an array of receptors.
