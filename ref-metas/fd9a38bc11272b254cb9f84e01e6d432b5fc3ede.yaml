paperAbstract: "Several state-of-the-art Generic Visual Categorization (GVC) systems\
  \ are built around a vocabulary of visual terms and characterize images with one\
  \ histogram of visual word counts. We propose a novel and practical approach to\
  \ GVC based on a universal vocabulary, which describes the content of all the considered\
  \ classes of images, and class vocabularies obtained through the adaptation of the\
  \ universal vocabulary using class-specific data. An image is characterized by a\
  \ set of histograms \u2013 one per class \u2013 where each histogram describes whether\
  \ the image content is best modeled by the universal vocabulary or the corresponding\
  \ class vocabulary. It is shown experimentally on three very different databases\
  \ that this novel representation outperforms those approaches which characterize\
  \ an image with a single histogram."
