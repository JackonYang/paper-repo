paperAbstract: Foreword The Support Vector Machine has recently been introduced as
  a new technique for solving various function estimation problems, including the
  pattern recognition problem. To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst
  extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization
  that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively
  minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining
  advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories
  into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches.
  The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector
  Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In
  addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using
  Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant
  way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the
  Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf.
  The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as
  excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology.
