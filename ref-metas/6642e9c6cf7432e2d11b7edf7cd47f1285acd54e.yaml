paperAbstract: We present a generative appearance-based method for recognizing human
  faces under variation in lighting and viewpoint. Our method exploits the fact that
  the set of images of an object in fixed pose, but under all possible illumination
  conditions, is a convex cone in the space of images. Using a small number of training
  images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo
  of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative
  model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel
  poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled and, for each
  pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear
  subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition
  algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination
  cone. Test results show that the method performs almost without error, except on
  the most extreme lighting directions.
