paperAbstract: "Many useful algorithms for processing images and geometry fall under\
  \ the general framework of high\u2010dimensional Gaussian filtering. This family\
  \ of algorithms includes bilateral filtering and non\u2010local means. We propose\
  \ a new way to perform such filters using the permutohedral lattice, which tessellates\
  \ high\u2010dimensional space with uniform simplices. Our algorithm is the first\
  \ implementation of a high\u2010dimensional Gaussian filter that is both linear\
  \ in input size and polynomial in dimensionality. Furthermore it is parameter\u2010\
  free, apart from the filter size, and achieves a consistently high accuracy relative\
  \ to ground truth (> 45 dB). We use this to demonstrate a number of interactive\u2010\
  rate applications of filters in as high as eight dimensions."
