paperAbstract: 'A view-based approach to the representation and recognition of human
  movement is presented. The basis of the representation is a temporal template-a
  static vector-image where the vector value at each point is a function of the motion
  properties at the corresponding spatial location in an image sequence. Using aerobics
  exercises as a test domain, we explore the representational power of a simple, two
  component version of the templates: The first value is a binary value indicating
  the presence of motion and the second value is a function of the recency of motion
  in a sequence. We then develop a recognition method matching temporal templates
  against stored instances of views of known actions. The method automatically performs
  temporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real-time
  on standard platforms.'
