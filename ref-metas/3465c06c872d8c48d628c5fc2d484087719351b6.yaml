paperAbstract: Pre-training techniques have been verified successfully in a variety
  of NLP tasks in recent years. Despite the widespread use of pre-training models
  for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation,
  while neglecting layout and style information that is vital for document image understanding.
  In this paper, we propose the LayoutLM to jointly model interactions between text
  and layout information across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a
  great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information
  extraction from scanned documents. Furthermore, we also leverage image features
  to incorporate words' visual information into LayoutLM. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework
  for document-level pre-training. It achieves new state-of-the-art results in several
  downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.72 to 79.27), receipt understanding
  (from 94.02 to 95.24) and document image classification (from 93.07 to 94.42). The
  code and pre-trained LayoutLM models are publicly available at https://aka.ms/layoutlm.
