paperAbstract: In this rich reference work, Beth Levin classifies over 3,000 English
  verbs according to shared meaning and behavior. Levin starts with the hypothesis
  that a verb's meaning influences its syntactic behavior and develops it into a powerful
  tool for studying the English verb lexicon. She shows how identifying verbs with
  similar syntactic behavior provides an effective means of distinguishing semantically
  coherent verb classes, and isolates these classes by examining verb behavior with
  respect to a wide range of syntactic alternations that reflect verb meaning. The
  first part of the book sets out alternate ways in which verbs can express their
  arguments. The second presents classes of verbs that share a kernel of meaning and
  explores in detail the behavior of each class, drawing on the alternations in the
  first part. Levin's discussion of each class and alternation includes lists of relevant
  verbs, illustrative examples, comments on noteworthy properties, and bibliographic
  references. The result is an original, systematic picture of the organization of
  the verb inventory. Easy to use, "English Verb Classes and Alternations" sets the
  stage for further explorations of the interface between lexical semantics and syntax.
  It will prove indispensable for theoretical and computational linguists, psycholinguists,
  cognitive scientists, lexicographers, and teachers of English as a second language.
  Beth Levin is associate professor of linguistics at Northwestern University.
