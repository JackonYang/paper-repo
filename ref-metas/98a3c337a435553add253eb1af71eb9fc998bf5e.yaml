paperAbstract: We describe a way of modeling high-dimensional data vectors by using
  an unsupervised, nonlinear, multilayer neural network in which the activity of each
  neuron-like unit makes an additive contribution to a global energy score that indicates
  how surprised the network is by the data vector. The connection weights that determine
  how the activity of each unit depends on the activities in earlier layers are learned
  by minimizing the energy assigned to data vectors that are actually observed and
  maximizing the energy assigned to "confabulations" that are generated by perturbing
  an observed data vector in a direction that decreases its energy under the current
  model.
