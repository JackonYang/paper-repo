paperAbstract: A general method for model-based object recognition in occluded scenes
  is presented. It is based on geometric hashing. The method stands out for its efficiency.
  We describe the general framework of the method and illustrate its applications
  for various recogni- tion problems both in 3-D and 2-D. Special attention is given
  to the recognition of 3-D objects in occluded scenes from 2-D gray scale images.
  New experimental results are included for this important case.
