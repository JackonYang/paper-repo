paperAbstract: For human pose estimation in monocular images, joint occlusions and
  overlapping upon human bodies often result in deviated pose predictions. Under these
  circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be produced. In contrast,
  human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric constraints of joint
  inter-connectivity. To address the problem by incorporating priors about the structure
  of human bodies, we propose a novel structure-aware convolutional network to implicitly
  take such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning
  of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, we design discriminators
  to distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible
  ones). If the pose generator (G) generates results that the discriminator fails
  to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors.,,To better
  capture the structure dependency of human body joints, the generator G is designed
  in a stacked multi-task manner to predict poses as well as occlusion heatmaps. Then,
  the pose and occlusion heatmaps are sent to the discriminators to predict the likelihood
  of the pose being real. Training of the network follows the strategy of conditional
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The effectiveness of the proposed network
  is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmark datasets. Our approach
  significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and almost always generates
  plausible human pose predictions.
