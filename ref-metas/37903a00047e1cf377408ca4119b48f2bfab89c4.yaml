paperAbstract: Abstract. The popularity of digital video is increasing rapidly. To
  help users navigate libraries of video, algorithms that automatically index video
  based on content are needed. One approach is to extract text appearing in video,
  which often reflects a scene's semantic content. This is a difficult problem due
  to the unconstrained nature of general-purpose video. Text can have arbitrary color,
  size, and orientation. Backgrounds may be complex and changing. Most work so far
  has made restrictive assumptions about the nature of text occurring in video. Such
  work is therefore not directly applicable to unconstrained, general-purpose video.
  In addition, most work so far has focused only on detecting the spatial extent of
  text in individual video frames. However, text occurring in video usually persists
  for several seconds. This constitutes a text event that should be entered only once
  in the video index. Therefore it is also necessary to determine the temporal extent
  of text events. This is a non-trivial problem because text may move, rotate, grow,
  shrink, or otherwise change over time. Such text effects are common in television
  programs and commercials but so far have received little attention in the literature.
  This paper discusses detecting, binarizing, and tracking caption text in general-purpose
  MPEG-1 video. Solutions are proposed for each of these problems and compared with
  existing work found in the literature.
