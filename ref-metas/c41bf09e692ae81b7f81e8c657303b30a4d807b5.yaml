paperAbstract: 'Feature space analysis is the main module in many computer vision
  tasks. The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent
  limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their
  number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one
  based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation
  becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit
  a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to
  reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation
  of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning
  procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance
  of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study.'
