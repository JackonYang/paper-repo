paperAbstract: "Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each\
  \ tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the\
  \ same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests\
  \ converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large.\
  \ The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength\
  \ of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using\
  \ a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare\
  \ favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings\
  \ of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust\
  \ with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation\
  \ and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used\
  \ in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance.\
  \ These ideas are also applicable to regression."
