paperAbstract: "This paper approaches the problem of \xAFnding correspondences between\
  \ images in which there are large changes in viewpoint, scale and illumi- nation.\
  \ Recent work has shown that scale-space `interest points' may be found with good\
  \ repeatability in spite of such changes. Further- more, the high entropy of the\
  \ surrounding image regions means that local descriptors are highly discriminative\
  \ for matching. For descrip- tors at interest points to be robustly matched between\
  \ images, they must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process. In this\
  \ work we introduce a family of features which use groups of interest points to\
  \ form geometrically invariant descriptors of image regions. Feature descriptors\
  \ are formed by resampling the image rel- ative to canonical frames de\xAFned by\
  \ the points. In addition to robust matching, a key advantage of this approach is\
  \ that each match implies a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation.\
  \ This allows us to immediately reject most of the false matches using a Hough trans-\
  \ form. We reject remaining outliers using RANSAC and the epipolar constraint. Results\
  \ show that dense feature matching can be achieved in a few seconds of computation\
  \ on 1GHz Pentium III machines."
