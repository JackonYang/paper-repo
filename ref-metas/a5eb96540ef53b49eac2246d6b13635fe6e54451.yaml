paperAbstract: A structured organization of information is typically required by symbolic
  processing. On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized
  according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework
  described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural
  nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular,
  relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where
  both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in
  this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and
  hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised
  learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured
  space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a
  recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for
  representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks,
  i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by
  generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate
  the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding
  the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing,
  inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding
  algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model.
