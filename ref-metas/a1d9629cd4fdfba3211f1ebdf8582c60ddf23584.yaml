paperAbstract: The shift of interest to web tables in HTML and PDF files, coupled
  with the incorporation of table analysis and conversion routines in commercial desktop
  document processing software, are likely to turn table recognition into more of
  a systems than an algorithmic issue. We illustrate the transition by some actual
  examples of web table conversion. We then suggest that the appropriate target format
  for table analysis, whether performed by conventional customized programs or by
  off-the-shelf software, is a representation based on the abstract table introduced
  by X. Wang in 1996. We show that the Wang model is adequate for some useful tasks
  that prove elusive for less explicit representations, and outline our plans to develop
  a semi-automated table processing system to demonstrate this approach. Screen-snaphots
  of a prototype tool to allow table mark-up in the style of Wang are also presented.
