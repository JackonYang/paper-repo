paperAbstract: In order to recover an accurate representation of a scene containing
  multiple moving objects, one must use estimation methods that can recover both model
  parameters and segmentation at the same time. Traditional approaches to this problem
  rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena.
  The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly
  representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust
  estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the
  number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating
  objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>
