paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose an approach to accurately localize detected
  objects. The goal is to predict which features pertain to the object and define
  the object extent with segmentation or bounding box. Our initial detector is a slight
  modification of the DPM detector by Felzenszwalb et al., which often reduces confusion
  with background and other objects but does not cover the full object. We then describe
  and evaluate several color models and edge cues for local predictions, and we propose
  two approaches for localization: learned graph cut segmentation and structural bounding
  box prediction. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset show that our approach
  leads to accurate pixel assignment and large improvement in bounding box overlap,
  sometimes leading to large overall improvement in detection accuracy.'
