paperAbstract: "Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable alternative for\
  \ constructing high performance coding systems. In particular, the recent success\
  \ of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved.\
  \ In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special\
  \ cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which\
  \ also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and\
  \ sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms,\
  \ where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201C\
  Tanner graph\u201D. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms\
  \ (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially\
  \ increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles\
  \ (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant\
  \ complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance\
  \ estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of\
  \ the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that\
  \ are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."
