paperAbstract: Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art results in a
  variety of settings, especially with vision datasets. Beyond the model definitions
  and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the
  solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find
  good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models.
  To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising
  Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show
  that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level,
  that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various
  techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures
  to understand more of how and why deep architectures work.
