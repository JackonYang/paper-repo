paperAbstract: Describing the main event of an image involves identifying the objects
  depicted and predicting the relationships between them. Previous approaches have
  represented images as unstructured bags of regions, which makes it difficult to
  accurately predict meaningful relationships between regions. In this paper, we introduce
  visual dependency representations to capture the relationships between the objects
  in an image, and hypothesize that this representation can improve image description.
  We test this hypothesis using a new data set of region-annotated images, associated
  with visual dependency representations and gold-standard descriptions. We describe
  two template-based description generation models that operate over visual dependency
  representations. In an image description task, we find that these models outperform
  approaches that rely on object proximity or corpus information to generate descriptions
  on both automatic measures and on human judgements.
