paperAbstract: In this paper, we study the salient object detection problem for images.
  We formulate this problem as a binary labeling task where we separate the salient
  object from the background. We propose a set of novel features, including multiscale
  contrast, center-surround histogram, and color spatial distribution, to describe
  a salient object locally, regionally, and globally. A conditional random field is
  learned to effectively combine these features for salient object detection. Further,
  we extend the proposed approach to detect a salient object from sequential images
  by introducing the dynamic salient features. We collected a large image database
  containing tens of thousands of carefully labeled images by multiple users and a
  video segment database, and conducted a set of experiments over them to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
