paperAbstract: We propose a flexible method for detecting and understanding tables
  in PDF files, which is not reliant upon one particular feature being present, for
  example ruling lines or indentations, and is therefore applicable to a wide variety
  of visual presentations. We describe the steps required in transforming the low-level
  PDF instructions into text segments, lines and boxes on a page. We propose three
  different classifications for published tables, and develop methods to detect these
  tables and correctly identify their respective rows and columns. We also explain
  how to recognize spanning rows and columns, and multi-line rows. Experimental results
  show that our algorithm is effective in converting a wide variety of tabular presentations
  into HTML for information extraction purposes.
