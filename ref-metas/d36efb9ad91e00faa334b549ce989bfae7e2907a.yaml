paperAbstract: Vibratory power unit for vibrating conveyers and screens comprising
  an asynchronous polyphase motor, at least one pair of associated unbalanced masses
  disposed on the shaft of said motor, with the first mass of a pair of said unbalanced
  masses being rigidly fastened to said shaft and with said second mass of said pair
  being movably arranged relative to said first mass, means for controlling and regulating
  the conveying rate during conveyer operation by varying the rotational speed of
  said motor between predetermined minimum and maximum values, said second mass being
  movably outwardly by centrifugal force against the pressure of spring means, said
  spring means being prestressed in such a manner that said second mass is, at rotational
  motor speeds lower than said minimum speed, held in its initial position, and at
  motor speeds between said lower and upper values in positions which are radially
  offset with respect to the axis of said motor to an extent depending on the value
  of said rotational motor speed.
