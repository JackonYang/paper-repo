paperAbstract: We define a process called congealing in which elements of a dataset
  (images) are brought into correspondence with each other jointly, producing a data-defined
  model. It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies
  over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization
  is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then
  demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with
  the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop
  a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing
  process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes,
  and demonstrate how using this density as "prior knowledge" can be used to develop
  a classifier based on only a single training example for each class.
