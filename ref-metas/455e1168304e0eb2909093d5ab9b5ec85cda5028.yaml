paperAbstract: "The string-to-string correction problem is to determine the distance\
  \ between two strings as measured by the minimum cost sequence of \u201Cedit operations\u201D\
  \ needed to change the one string into the other. The edit operations investigated\
  \ allow changing one symbol of a string into another single symbol, deleting one\
  \ symbol from a string, or inserting a single symbol into a string. An algorithm\
  \ is presented which solves this problem in time proportional to the product of\
  \ the lengths of the two strings. Possible applications are to the problems of automatic\
  \ spelling correction and determining the longest subsequence of characters common\
  \ to two strings."
