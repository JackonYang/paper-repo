paperAbstract: Knowledge-based natural language processing systems have achieved good
  success with certain tasks but they are often criticized because they depend on
  a domain-specific dictionary that requires a great deal of manual knowledge engineering.
  This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes knowledge-based NLP systems impractical
  for real-world applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported to
  new domains. In response to this problem, we developed a system called AutoSlog
  that automatically builds a domain-specific dictionary of concepts for extracting
  information from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictionary for the domain
  of terrorist event descriptions in only 5 person-hours. We then compared the AutoSlog
  dictionary with a hand-crafted dictionary that was built by two highly skilled graduate
  students and required approximately 1500 person-hours of effort. We evaluated the
  two dictionaries using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the AutoSlog
  dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the
  first test set, the AutoSlog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the performance of the
  hand-crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the overall scores were virtually
  indistinguishable with the AutoSlog dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance
  of the handcrafted dictionary.
