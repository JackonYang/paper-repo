paperAbstract: "Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image\
  \ segmentation since for binary random field representations of the image, it gives\
  \ globally optimal results and there are efficient polynomial time implementations.\
  \ Often, the random field is applied over a flat partitioning of the image into\
  \ non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show\
  \ that if, instead of a flat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical\
  \ segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms\
  \ can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding benefits of\
  \ global optimality and efficiency). As a result of such inference, the image gets\
  \ partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the\
  \ tree. \n \nWe apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task\
  \ of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging\
  \ to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference\
  \ on a segmentation tree (over a flat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization\
  \ in the pylon model is able to flexibly choose the level of segmentation across\
  \ the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on\
  \ several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested\
  \ approaches."
