paperAbstract: 'Evaluation of object detection algorithms is a non-trivial task: a
  detection result is usually evaluated by comparing the bounding box of the detected
  object with the bounding box of the ground truth object. The commonly used precision
  and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles.
  However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don''t give intuitive information
  about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms,
  and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity
  in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is
  often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures.In this paper we propose a new approach
  which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated
  intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall
  depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection
  algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs.
  The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by
  performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different
  types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection
  algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition.'
