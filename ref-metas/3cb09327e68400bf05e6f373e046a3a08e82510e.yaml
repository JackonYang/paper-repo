paperAbstract: In many applications of natural language processing it is necessary
  to determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech recognizer
  may need to determine which of the two word combinations "eat a peach" and "eat
  a beach" is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word
  combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature
  of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur
  in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability
  of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on "most
  similar" words.We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional
  word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word
  bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields
  a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically
  significant reductions in speech-recognition error.
