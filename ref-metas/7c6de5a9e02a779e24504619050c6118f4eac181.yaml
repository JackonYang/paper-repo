paperAbstract: Numerous important problems can be framed as learning from graph data.
  We propose a framework for learning convolutional neural networks for arbitrary
  graphs. These graphs may be undirected, directed, and with both discrete and continuous
  node and edge attributes. Analogous to image-based convolutional networks that operate
  on locally connected regions of the input, we present a general approach to extracting
  locally connected regions from graphs. Using established benchmark data sets, we
  demonstrate that the learned feature representations are competitive with state
  of the art graph kernels and that their computation is highly efficient.
