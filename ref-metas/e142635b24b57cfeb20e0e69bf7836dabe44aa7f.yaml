paperAbstract: A formulation is proposed for minimum-error classification, in which
  the misclassification probability is to be minimized based on a given set of training
  samples. A fundamental technique for designing a classifier that approaches the
  objective of minimum classification error in a more direct manner than traditional
  methods is given. The method is contrasted with several traditional classifier designs
  in typical experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the new learning formulation.
  The method can applied to other classifier structures as well. Experimental results
  pertaining to a speech recognition task are provided to show the effectiveness of
  the technique. >
