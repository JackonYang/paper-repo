paperAbstract: 'We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures
  that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We focus
  on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of images
  that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our
  primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data,
  nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using
  our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification
  on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed
  by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish
  from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We
  also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods
  enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.'
