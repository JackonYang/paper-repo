paperAbstract: 1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque
  and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating
  the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple,
  complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously
  described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and
  there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion
  of the cells are colour coded.
