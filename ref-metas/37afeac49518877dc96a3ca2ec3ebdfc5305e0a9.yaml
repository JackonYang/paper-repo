paperAbstract: We present a universal statistical model for texture images in the
  context of an overcomplete complex wavelet transform. The model is parameterized
  by a set of statistics computed on pairs of coefficients corresponding to basis
  functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. We develop an
  efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints,
  by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint, and
  we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular, we demonstrate
  the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis
  that fail when those parameters are removed from the set. We also demonstrate the
  power of our model by successfully synthesizing examples drawn from a diverse collection
  of artificial and natural textures.
