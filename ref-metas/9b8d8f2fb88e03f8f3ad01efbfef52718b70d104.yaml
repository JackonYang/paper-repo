paperAbstract: "The k-means algorithm is by far the most widely used method for discovering\
  \ clusters in data. We show how to accelerate it dramatically, while still always\
  \ computing exactly the same result as the standard algorithm. The accelerated algorithm\
  \ avoids unnecessary distance calculations by applying the triangle inequality in\
  \ two different ways, and by keeping track of lower and upper bounds for distances\
  \ between points and centers. Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective\
  \ for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as\
  \ the number k of clusters increases. For k \u2265 20 it is many times faster than\
  \ the best previously known accelerated k-means method."
