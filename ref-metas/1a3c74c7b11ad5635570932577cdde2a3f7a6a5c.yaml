paperAbstract: "Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed\
  \ traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on a variety\
  \ of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also\
  \ achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random \u201C\
  dropout\u201D procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly\
  \ omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid\
  \ over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task\
  \ using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for\
  \ large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely\
  \ to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU)\
  \ non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved\
  \ faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative\
  \ performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that\
  \ modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level\
  \ training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid\
  \ units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were\
  \ able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly\
  \ available Bayesian optimization code."
