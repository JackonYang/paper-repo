paperAbstract: This paper describes the results of the ICDAR 2005 competition for
  locating text in camera captured scenes. For this we used the same data as the ICDAR
  2003 competition, which has been kept private until now. This allows a direct comparison
  with the 2003 entries. The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved
  significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from
  0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure
  used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment
  and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now
  been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more
  immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system.
