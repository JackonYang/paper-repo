paperAbstract: A table in a document is a rectilinear arrangement of cells where each
  cell contains a sequence of words. Several lines of text may compose one cell. Cells
  may be delimited by horizontal or vertical lines, but often this is not the case.
  A table analysis system is described which reconstructs table formatting information
  from table images whether or not the cells are explicitly delimited. Inputs to the
  system are word bounding boxes and any horizontal and vertical lines that delimit
  cells. Using a sequence of carefully-crafted rules, multi-line cells and their interrelationships
  are found even though no explicit delimiters are visible. This robust system is
  a component of a commercial document recognition system.
