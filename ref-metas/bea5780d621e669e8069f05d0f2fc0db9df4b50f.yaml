paperAbstract: We describe how to train a two-layer convolutional Deep Belief Network
  (DBN) on the 1.6 million tiny images dataset. When training a convolutional DBN,
  one must decide what to do with the edge pixels of teh images. As the pixels near
  the edge of an image contribute to the fewest convolutional lter outputs, the model
  may see it t to tailor its few convolutional lters to better model the edge pixels.
  This is undesirable becaue it usually comes at the expense of a good model for the
  interior parts of the image. We investigate several ways of dealing with the edge
  pixels when training a convolutional DBN. Using a combination of locally-connected
  convolutional units and globally-connected units, as well as a few tricks to reduce
  the e ects of over tting, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the classi
  cation task of the CIFAR-10 subset of the tiny images dataset.
