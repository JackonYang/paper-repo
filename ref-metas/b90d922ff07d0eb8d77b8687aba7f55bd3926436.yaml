paperAbstract: "We consider problems involving groups of data where each observation\
  \ within a group is a draw from a mixture model and where it is desirable to share\
  \ mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components\
  \ is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is\
  \ natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the\
  \ well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric\
  \ prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire\
  \ to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model,\
  \ specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is\
  \ itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being\
  \ discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired,\
  \ the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components.\
  \ We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking\
  \ process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer\
  \ to as the \u201CChinese restaurant franchise.\u201D We present Markov chain Monte\
  \ Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures\
  \ and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling."
