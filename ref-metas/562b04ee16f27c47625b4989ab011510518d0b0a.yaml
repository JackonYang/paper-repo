paperAbstract: 'Sliding window scanning is the dominant paradigm in object recognition
  research today. But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped
  object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive
  for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of
  image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this
  paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions:
  1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide
  better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition
  performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second,
  we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments
  approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate
  the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility
  of doing so without excessive computational burden.'
