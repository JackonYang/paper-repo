paperAbstract: 'This article presents: (i) a multiscale representation of grey-level
  shape called the scale-space primal sketch, which makes explicit both features in
  scale-space and the relations between structures at different scales, (ii) a methodology
  for extracting significant blob-like image structures from this representation,
  and (iii) applications to edge detection, histogram analysis, and junction classification
  demonstrating how the proposed method can be used for guiding later-stage visual
  processes.The representation gives a qualitative description of image structure,
  which allows for detection of stable scales and associated regions of interest in
  a solely bottom-up data-driven way. In other words, it generates coarse segmentation
  cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly
  tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing
  tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the
  proposed theory gives intuitive results.'
