paperAbstract: The Construe news story categorization system assigns indexing terms
  to news stories according to their content using knowledge-based techniques. An
  initial deployment of Construe in Reuters Ltd. topic identification system (TIS)
  has replaced human indexing for Reuters Country Reports, an online information service
  based on news stories indexed by country and type of news. TIS indexing is comparable
  to human indexing in overall accuracy but costs much less, is more consistent, and
  is available much more rapidly. TIS can be justified in terms of cost savings alone,
  but Reuters also expects the speed and consistency of TIS to provide significant
  competitive advantage and, hence, an increased market share for Country Reports
  and other products from Reuters Historical Information Products Division.
