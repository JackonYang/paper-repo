paperAbstract: There is a considerable interest in designing automatic systems that
  will scan a given paper document and store it on electronic media for easier storage,
  manipulation, and access. Most documents contain graphics and images in addition
  to text. Thus, the document image has to be segmented to identify the text regions,
  so that OCR techniques may be applied only to those regions. In this paper, we present
  a simple method for document image segmentation in which text regions in a given
  document image are automatically identified. The proposed segmentation method for
  document images is based on a multichannel filtering approach to texture segmentation.
  The text in the document is considered as a textured region. Nontext contents in
  the document, such as blank spaces, graphics, and pictures, are considered as regions
  with different textures. Thus, the problem of segmenting document images into text
  and nontext regions can be posed as a texture segmentation problem. Two-dimensional
  Gabor filters are used to extract texture features for each of these regions. These
  filters have been extensively used earlier for a variety of texture segmentation
  tasks. Here we apply the same filters to the document image segmentation problem.
  Our segmentation method does not assume any a priori knowledge about the content
  or font styles of the document, and is shown to work even for skewed images and
  handwritten text. Results of the proposed segmentation method are presented for
  several test images which demonstrate the robustness of this technique.
