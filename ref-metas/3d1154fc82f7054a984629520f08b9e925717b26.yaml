paperAbstract: While modern off-the-shelf OCR engines show particularly high accuracy
  on scanned text, text detection and recognition in natural images still remains
  a challenging problem. Here, we demonstrate that OCR engines can still perform well
  on this harder task as long as appropriate image binarization is applied to input
  photographs. For such binarization, we systematically evaluate the performance of
  12 binarization methods as well as of a new binarization algorithm that we propose
  here. Our evaluation includes different metrics and uses established natural image
  text recognition benchmarks (ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2011). Our main finding is thus
  the fact that image binarization methods combined with additional filtering of generated
  connected components and off-the-shelf OCR engines can achieve state-of-the-art
  performance for end-to-end text understanding in natural images.
