paperAbstract: In the last two years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved
  an impressive suite of results on standard recognition datasets and tasks. CNN-based
  features seem poised to quickly replace engineered representations, such as SIFT
  and HOG. However, compared to SIFT and HOG, we understand much less about the nature
  of the features learned by large CNNs. In this paper, we experimentally probe several
  aspects of CNN feature learning in an attempt to help practitioners gain useful,
  evidence-backed intuitions about how to apply CNNs to computer vision problems.
