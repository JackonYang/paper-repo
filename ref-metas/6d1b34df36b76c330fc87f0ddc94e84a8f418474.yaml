paperAbstract: 'This paper deals with applications of Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF)
  to coding of voice signal in sub-bands. Use of QMF''s enables to avoid the aliasing
  effects due to samples decimation when signal is split into sub-bands. Each sub-band
  is then coded independently with use of Block Companded PCM (BCPCM) quantizers.
  Then a variable number of bits is allocated to each sub-band quantizer in order
  to take advantage of the relative perceptual effect of the quantizing error. The
  paper is organized as follows: - First, splitting in two sub-bands with QMF''s is
  analysed. -Then, a general description of a splitband voice coding scheme using
  QMF''s is made. -Finally, two coding schemes are considered, operating respectively
  at 16 KBps and 32 KBps. Averaged values of S/N performances are given when encoding
  both male and female voices. Comparisons are made with conventional BCPCM and CCITT
  A-Law. Taped results will be played at the conference.'
