paperAbstract: LIBSVM is a library for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have been
  actively developing this package since the year 2000. The goal is to help users
  to easily apply SVM to their applications. LIBSVM has gained wide popularity in
  machine learning and many other areas. In this article, we present all implementation
  details of LIBSVM. Issues such as solving SVM optimization problems theoretical
  convergence multiclass classification probability estimates and parameter selection
  are discussed in detail.
