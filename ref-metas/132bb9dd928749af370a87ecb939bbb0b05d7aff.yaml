paperAbstract: This paper describes an automatic, context-sensitive, word-error correction
  system based on statistical language modeling (SLM) as applied to optical character
  recognition (OCR) postprocessing. The system exploits information from multiple
  sources, including letter n-grams, character confusion probabilities, and word-bigram
  probabilities. Letter n-grams are used to index the words in the lexicon. Given
  a sentence to be corrected, the system decomposes each string in the sentence into
  letter n-grams and retrieves word candidates from the lexicon by comparing string
  n-grams with lexicon-entry n-grams. The retrieved candidates are ranked by the conditional
  probability of matches with the string, given character confusion probabilities.
  Finally, the wordobigram model and Viterbi algorithm are used to determine the best
  scoring word sequence for the sentence. The system can correct non-word errors as
  well as real-word errors and achieves a 60.2% error reduction rate for real OCR
  text. In addition, the system can learn the character confusion probabilities for
  a specific OCR environment and use them in self-calibration to achieve better performance.
