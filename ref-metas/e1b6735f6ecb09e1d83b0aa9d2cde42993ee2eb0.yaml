paperAbstract: Effective image and sentence matching depends on how to well measure
  their global visual-semantic similarity. Based on the observation that such a global
  similarity arises from a complex aggregation of multiple local similarities between
  pairwise instances of image (objects) and sentence (words), we propose a selective
  multimodal Long Short-Term Memory network (sm-LSTM) for instance-aware image and
  sentence matching. The sm-LSTM includes a multimodal context-modulated attention
  scheme at each timestep that can selectively attend to a pair of instances of image
  and sentence, by predicting pairwise instance-aware saliency maps for image and
  sentence. For selected pairwise instances, their representations are obtained based
  on the predicted saliency maps, and then compared to measure their local similarity.
  By similarly measuring multiple local similarities within a few timesteps, the sm-LSTM
  sequentially aggregates them with hidden states to obtain a final matching score
  as the desired global similarity. Extensive experiments show that our model can
  well match image and sentence with complex content, and achieve the state-of-the-art
  results on two public benchmark datasets.
