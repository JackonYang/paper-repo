paperAbstract: Segmentation is a key step in many off-line handwriting recognition
  systems but, to date, there are almost no ground truth segmentation databases and
  no widely accepted and formally defined metrics for segmentation performance. This
  paper proposes a representation of segmentations and presegmentations in terms of
  color images. Such representations allow convenient interchange of ground truth
  and hypothesized segmentations in the form of standard image formats. The paper
  formally defines the notions of oversegmentation and undersegmentation in terms
  of the maximal bipartite match between corresponding pixels. It also defines a number
  of metrics that quantify the frequency and extent of events in handwriting like
  kerning, splitting, and merging of characters. It is hoped that these metrics and
  representations will find wider use in the community and serve as a basis for creating
  standard training and test databases of segmentation data.
