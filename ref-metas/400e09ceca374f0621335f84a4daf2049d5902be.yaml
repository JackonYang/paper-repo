paperAbstract: 'We address the problem of image search on a very large scale, where
  three constraints have to be considered jointly: the accuracy of the search, its
  efficiency, and the memory usage of the representation. We first propose a simple
  yet efficient way of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector of limited
  dimension, which can be viewed as a simplification of the Fisher kernel representation.
  We then show how to jointly optimize the dimension reduction and the indexing algorithm,
  so that it best preserves the quality of vector comparison. The evaluation shows
  that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art: the search accuracy
  is comparable to the bag-of-features approach for an image representation that fits
  in 20 bytes. Searching a 10 million image dataset takes about 50ms.'
