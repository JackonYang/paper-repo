paperAbstract: The current paper presents a novel texture-based method for detecting
  texts in images. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to analyze the textural
  properties of texts. No external texture feature extraction module is used, but
  rather the intensities of the raw pixels that make up the textural pattern are fed
  directly to the SVM, which works well even in high-dimensional spaces. Next, text
  regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm
  (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and
  SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture
  analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the
  input image to be texture-analyzed.
