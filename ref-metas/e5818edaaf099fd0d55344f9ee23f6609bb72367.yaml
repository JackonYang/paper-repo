paperAbstract: A document understanding method based on the tree representation of
  document structures is proposed. It is shown that documents have an obvious hierarchical
  structure in their geometry which is represented by a tree. A small number of rules
  are introduced to transform the geometric structure into the logical structure which
  represents the semantics. The virtual field separator technique is employed to utilize
  the information carried by special constituents of documents such as field separators
  and frames, keeping the number of transformation rules small. Experimental results
  on a variety of document formats have shown that the proposed method is applicable
  to most of the documents commonly encountered in daily use, although there is still
  room for further refinement of the transformation rules.<<ETX>>
