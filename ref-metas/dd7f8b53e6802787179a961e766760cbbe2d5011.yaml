paperAbstract: We describe the approach that won the preliminary phase of the German
  traffic sign recognition benchmark with a better-than-human recognition rate of
  98.98%.We obtain an even better recognition rate of 99.15% by further training the
  nets. Our fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of a Convolutional Neural
  Network does not require careful design of pre-wired feature extractors, which are
  rather learned in a supervised way. A CNN/MLP committee further boosts recognition
  performance.
