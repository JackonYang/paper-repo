paperAbstract: A definition of discrete Markovian random fields is formulated analogously
  to a definition for the continuous case given by Levy. This definition in the homogeneous
  Gaussian case leads to a difference equation that sets forth the state of the field
  in terms of its values on a band of minimum width P , where P is the order of the
  process. The state of the field at position (i,j) is given by the set of values
  of the nearest neighbors within distance P of the point (i,j) . Conversely, given
  a difference equation satisfying certain conditions relating to stability, there
  corresponds a homogeneous discrete Markov random field. This theory is applied to
  the problem of obtaining spectral estimates of a two-dimensional field, given observation
  over a limited aperture.
