paperAbstract: We present an automatic approach to tree annotation in which basic
  nonterminal symbols are alternately split and merged to maximize the likelihood
  of a training treebank. Starting with a simple X-bar grammar, we learn a new grammar
  whose nonterminals are subsymbols of the original nonterminals. In contrast with
  previous work, we are able to split various terminals to different degrees, as appropriate
  to the actual complexity in the data. Our grammars automatically learn the kinds
  of linguistic distinctions exhibited in previous work on manual tree annotation.
  On the other hand, our grammars are much more compact and substantially more accurate
  than previous work on automatic annotation. Despite its simplicity, our best grammar
  achieves an F1 of 90.2% on the Penn Treebank, higher than fully lexicalized systems.
