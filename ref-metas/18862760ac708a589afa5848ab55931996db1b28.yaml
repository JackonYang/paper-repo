paperAbstract: Finding good representations of text documents is crucial in information
  retrieval and classification systems. Today the most popular document representation
  is based on a vector of word counts in the document. This representation neither
  captures dependencies between related words, nor handles synonyms or polysemous
  words. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to learn text document representations
  based on semi-supervised autoencoders that are stacked to form a deep network. The
  model can be trained efficiently on partially labeled corpora, producing very compact
  representations of documents, while retaining as much class information and joint
  word statistics as possible. We show that it is advantageous to exploit even a few
  labeled samples during training.
