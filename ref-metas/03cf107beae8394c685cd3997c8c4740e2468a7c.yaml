paperAbstract: We present an approach for object recognition that combines detection
  and segmentation within a efficient hypothesize/test framework. Scanning-window
  template classifiers are the current state-of-the-art for many object classes such
  as faces, cars, and pedestrians. Such approaches, though quite successful, can be
  hindered by their lack of explicit encoding of object shape/structure - one might,
  for example, find faces in trees. We adopt the following strategy; we first use
  these systems as attention mechanisms, generating many possible object locations
  by tuning them for low missed-detections and high false-positives. At each hypothesized
  detection, we compute a local figure-ground segmentation using a window of slightly
  larger extent than that used by the classifier. This segmentation task is guided
  by top-down knowledge. We learn offline from training data those segmentations that
  are consistent with true positives. We then prune away those hypotheses with bad
  segmentations. We show this strategy leads to significant improvements (10-20%)
  over established approaches such as ViolaJones and DalalTriggs on a variety of benchmark
  datasets including the PASCAL challenge, LabelMe, and the INRIAPerson dataset.
