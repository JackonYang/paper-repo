paperAbstract: Simultaneous tracking of multiple persons in real-world environments
  is an active research field and several approaches have been proposed, based on
  a variety of features and algorithms. Recently, there has been a growing interest
  in organizing systematic evaluations to compare the various techniques. Unfortunately,
  the lack of common metrics for measuring the performance of multiple object trackers
  still makes it hard to compare their results. In this work, we introduce two intuitive
  and general metrics to allow for objective comparison of tracker characteristics,
  focusing on their precision in estimating object locations, their accuracy in recognizing
  object configurations and their ability to consistently label objects over time.
  These metrics have been extensively used in two large-scale international evaluations,
  the 2006 and 2007 CLEAR evaluations, to measure and compare the performance of multiple
  object trackers for a wide variety of tracking tasks. Selected performance results
  are presented and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented metrics are discussed
  based on the experience gained during the evaluations.
