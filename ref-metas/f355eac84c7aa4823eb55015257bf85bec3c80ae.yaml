paperAbstract: Information extraction (IE) is the technique for transforming unstructured
  textual data into structured representation that can be understood by machines.
  The exponential growth of the Web generates an exceptional quantity of data for
  which automatic knowledge capture is essential. This work describes the methodology
  for web scale information extraction in the LODIE project (linked open data information
  extraction) and highlights results from the early experiments carried out in the
  initial phase of the project. LODIE aims to develop information extraction techniques
  able to scale at web level and adapt to user information needs. The core idea behind
  LODIE is the usage of linked open data, a very large-scale information resource,
  as a ground-breaking solution for IE, which provides invaluable annotated data on
  a growing number of domains. This article has two objectives. First, describing
  the LODIE project as a whole and depicting its general challenges and directions.
  Second, describing some initial steps taken towards the general solution, focusing
  on a specific IE subtask, wrapper induction.
