paperAbstract: Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of
  numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection
  is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization.
  A general gradient descent boosting paradigm is developed for additive expansions
  based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares,
  least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass
  logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the
  particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and
  tools for interpreting such TreeBoost models are presented. Gradient boosting of
  regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for
  both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than
  clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund
  and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.
