paperAbstract: 'This paper presents the results of the first Challenge of ICDAR 2011
  Robust Reading Competition. Challenge 1 is focused on the extraction of text from
  born-digital images, specifically from images found in Web pages and emails. The
  challenge was organized in terms of three tasks that look at different stages of
  the process: text localization, text segmentation and word recognition. In this
  paper we present the results of the challenge for all three tasks, and make an open
  call for continuous participation outside the context of ICDAR 2011.'
