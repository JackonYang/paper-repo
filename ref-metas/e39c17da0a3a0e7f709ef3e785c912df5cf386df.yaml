paperAbstract: First-order nonlinear differential-delay equations describing physiological
  control systems are studied. The equations display a broad diversity of dynamical
  behavior including limit cycle oscillations, with a variety of wave forms, and apparently
  aperiodic or "chaotic" solutions. These results are discussed in relation to dynamical
  respiratory and hematopoietic diseases.
