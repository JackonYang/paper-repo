paperAbstract: TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms,
  and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using
  TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous
  systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale
  distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices
  such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety
  of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network
  models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning
  systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other
  fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval,
  natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational
  drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation
  of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference
  implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license
  in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.
