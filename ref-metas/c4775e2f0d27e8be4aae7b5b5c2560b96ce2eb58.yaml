paperAbstract: Speech recognition is formulated as a problem of maximum likelihood
  decoding. This formulation requires statistical models of the speech production
  process. In this paper, we describe a number of statistical models for use in speech
  recognition. We give special attention to determining the parameters for such models
  from sparse data. We also describe two decoding methods, one appropriate for constrained
  artificial languages and one appropriate for more realistic decoding tasks. To illustrate
  the usefulness of the methods described, we review a number of decoding results
  that have been obtained with them.
