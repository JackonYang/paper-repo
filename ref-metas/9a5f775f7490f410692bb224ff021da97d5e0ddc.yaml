paperAbstract: This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This
  theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum
  entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods
  for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes
  the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution
  f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference
  about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling
  consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank
  to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture
  images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms
  are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature
  extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution
  p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1).
  This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion.
  A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The
  resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a
  Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much
  stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling.
  Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples
  from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture
  images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments
  on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to
  show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many
  textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled
  and synthesized in a common framework.
