paperAbstract: CUDAMat is an open source software package that provides a CUDA-based
  matrix class for Python. The primary goal of CUDAMat is to make it easy to implement
  algorithms that are easily expressed in terms of dense matrix operations on a GPU.
  At present, the feature set of CUDAMat is biased towards providing functionality
  useful for implementing standard machine learning algorithms, however, it is general
  enough to be useful in other elds. We have used CUDAMat to implement several common
  machine learning algorithms on GPUs oering speedups of up to 50x over numpy and
  MATLAB implementations.
