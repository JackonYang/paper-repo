paperAbstract: "This paper is a survey of Artifici'al Intelligence (AI). It divides\
  \ the field into four cor~ topics (embodying the base fo\xB7r a science of intelligence)\
  \ and eight applications topics (in which research has been contributing to core\
  \ ideas).. The paper discusses the history, the major landmarks, and some of the\
  \ controversies in each of these twelve topics. Each topic is represented by a chart\
  \ citing the major references. These references are contained in an extensive bibliography.\
  \ The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the criticisms of 'AI and with\
  \ some predictions about the course of future research."
