paperAbstract: A methodology for evaluating range image segmentation algorithms is
  proposed. This methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser range finder images
  and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth
  and (2) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented,
  missed, and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered
  geometry. A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation
  against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate
  their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches.
