paperAbstract: It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with
  a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more
  closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall.
  It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta
  becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should
  vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal
  amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta
  is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated
  quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The
  optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum.
  It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result
  as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b}
  quanta, b=1,2, \cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian
  distribution of signal amplitudes.
