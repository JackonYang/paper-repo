paperAbstract: Abstract. We present a kernel-based framework for pattern recognition,
  regression estimation, function approximation, and multiple operator inversion.
  Adopting a regularization-theoretic framework, the above are formulated as constrained
  optimization problems. Previous approaches such as ridge regression, support vector
  methods, and regularization networks are included as special cases. We show connections
  between the cost function and some properties up to now believed to apply to support
  vector machines only. For appropriately chosen cost functions, the optimal solution
  of all the problems described above can be found by solving a simple quadratic programming
  problem.
