paperAbstract: 'The method of Structural Risk Minimization refers to tuning the capacity
  of the classifier to the available amount of training data. This capacity is influenced
  by several factors, including: (1) properties of the input space, (2) nature and
  structure of the classifier, and (3) learning algorithm. Actions based on these
  three factors are combined here to control the capacity of linear classifiers and
  improve generalization on the problem of handwritten digit recognition.'
