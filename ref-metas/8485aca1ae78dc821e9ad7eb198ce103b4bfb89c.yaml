paperAbstract: Various kinds of complex table forms are used for many purposes, e.g.
  application forms. This paper presents a graph grammar based approach to the complex
  table form structure analysis. In our study, field types are classified into four,
  i.e. blank, insertion, indication, explanation, and four kinds of indication patterns
  are defined between indication and blank or insertion. Then, two dimensional relations
  between horizontally and vertically adjacent fields are described by graph representation
  and those reduction procedures are defined as production rules. We have designed
  56 meta rules from which 6745 rules are generated for a complex table form analysis.
  Experimental results have shown that 31 kinds of different table forms are successfully
  analyzed using two types of meta grammar.
