paperAbstract: In this paper, a system for the reading of totally unconstrained handwritten
  text is presented. The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting
  recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic
  knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another
  novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult
  problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number
  of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted.
  The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on
  their perplexity.
