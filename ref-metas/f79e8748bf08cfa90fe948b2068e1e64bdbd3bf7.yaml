paperAbstract: Extracting text objects from scene images is a challenging problem.
  In this paper, by investigating the properties of single characters and text objects,
  we propose a new text extraction approach for scene images. First, character energy
  is computed based on the similarity of stroke edges to detect candidate character
  regions, then link energy is calculated based on the spatial relationship and similarity
  between neighboring candidate character regions to group characters and eliminate
  false positives. We applied the approach on ICDAR dataset 2003. The experimental
  results demonstrate the validity of our method.
