paperAbstract: 'Statistical supervised learning techniques have been successful for
  many natural language processing tasks, but they require labeled datasets, which
  can be expensive to obtain. On the other hand, unlabeled data (raw text) is often
  available "for free" in large quantities. Unlabeled data has shown promise in improving
  the performance of a number of tasks, e.g. word sense disambiguation, information
  extraction, and natural language parsing. In this thesis, we focus on two segmentation
  tasks, named-entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation. The goal of named-entity
  recognition is to detect and classify names of people, organizations, and locations
  in a sentence. The goal of Chinese word segmentation is to find the word boundaries
  in a sentence that has been written as a string of characters without spaces. Our
  approach is as follows: In a preprocessing step, we use raw text to cluster words
  and calculate mutual information statistics. The output of this step is then used
  as features in a supervised model, specifically a global linear model trained using
  the Perceptron algorithm. We also compare Markov and semi-Markov models on the two
  segmentation tasks. Our results show that features derived from unlabeled data substantially
  improves performance, both in terms of reducing the amount of labeled data needed
  to achieve a certain performance level and in terms of reducing the error using
  a fixed amount of labeled data. We find that sometimes semi-Markov models can also
  improve performance over Markov models. Thesis Supervisor: Michael Collins Title:
