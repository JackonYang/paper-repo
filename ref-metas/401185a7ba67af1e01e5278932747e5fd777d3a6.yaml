paperAbstract: In two recent studies of the cat's striate cortex (Hubel, 1959; Hubel
  & Wiesel, 1959) single units were shown to react to light stimuli in a highly specific
  manner. Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina
  with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted
  spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement.
  It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms.
  The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in
  retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate
  units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although
  the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and
  his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to
  moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the
  complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower
  levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained
  animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar
  conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually
  any part of the brain of the freely moving animal.
