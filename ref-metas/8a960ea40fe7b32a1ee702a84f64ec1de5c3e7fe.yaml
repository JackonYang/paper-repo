paperAbstract: The lack of access to visual information like text labels, icons, and
  colors can cause frustration and decrease independence for blind people. Current
  access technology uses automatic approaches to address some problems in this space,
  but the technology is error-prone, limited in scope, and quite expensive. In this
  paper, we introduce VizWiz, a talking application for mobile phones that offers
  a new alternative to answering visual questions in nearly real-time - asking multiple
  people on the web. To support answering questions quickly, we introduce a general
  approach for intelligently recruiting human workers in advance called quikTurkit
  so that workers are available when new questions arrive. A field deployment with
  11 blind participants illustrates that blind people can effectively use VizWiz to
  cheaply answer questions in their everyday lives, highlighting issues that automatic
  approaches will need to address to be useful. Finally, we illustrate the potential
  of using VizWiz as part of the participatory design of advanced tools by using it
  to build and evaluate VizWiz::LocateIt, an interactive mobile tool that helps blind
  people solve general visual search problems.
