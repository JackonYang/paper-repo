paperAbstract: We propose a family of learning algorithms based on a new form of regularization
  that allows us to exploit the geometry of the marginal distribution. We focus on
  a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose
  learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including
  support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special
  cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer
  theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast
  to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to
  novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised
  settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms
  are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of
  unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework.
