paperAbstract: Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language
  processing. A recently released dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset
  (SQuAD), offers a large number of real questions and their answers created by humans
  through crowdsourcing. SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine
  comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD
  the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable
  lengths. We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture
  is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and
  Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al.(2015) to constrain
  the output tokens to be from the input sequences. We propose two ways of using Pointer
  Net for our task. Our experiments show that both of our two models substantially
  outperform the best results obtained by Rajpurkar et al.(2016) using logistic regression
  and manually crafted features.
