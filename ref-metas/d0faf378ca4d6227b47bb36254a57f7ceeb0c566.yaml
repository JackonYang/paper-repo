paperAbstract: In earlier work, we proposed treating wide baseline matching of feature
  points as a classification problem, in which each class corresponds to the set of
  all possible views of such a point. We used a K-mean plus Nearest Neighbor classifier
  to validate our approach, mostly because it was simple to implement. It has proved
  effective but still too slow for real-time use. In this paper, we advocate instead
  the use of randomized trees as the classification technique. It is both fast enough
  for real-time performance and more robust. It also gives us a principled way not
  only to match keypoints but to select during a training phase those that are the
  most recognizable ones. This results in a real-time system able to detect and position
  in 3D planar, non-planar, and even deformable objects. It is robust to illuminations
  changes, scale changes and occlusions.
