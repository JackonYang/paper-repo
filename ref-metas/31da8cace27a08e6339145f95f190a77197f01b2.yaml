paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a method for the retrieval of document images
  with chosen layout characteristics. The proposed method is based on statistics of
  patch-codewords over different regions of image. We begin with a set of wanted and
  a random set of unwanted images representative of a large heterogeneous collection.
  We then use raw-image patches extracted from the unlabeled images to learn a codebook.
  To model the spatial relationships between patches, the image is recursively partitioned
  horizontally and vertically, and a histogram of patch-codewords is computed in each
  partition. The resulting set of features give a high precision and recall for the
  retrieval of hand-drawn and machine-print table-documents, and unconstrained mixed
  form-type documents, when trained using a random forest classifier. We compare our
  method to the spatial-pyramid method, and show that the proposed approach for learning
  layout characteristics is competitive for document images.
