paperAbstract: The sliding window approach of detecting rigid objects (such as cars)
  is predicated on the belief that the object can be identified from the appearance
  in a small region around the object. Other types of objects of amorphous spatial
  extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture
  or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects
  into a system that leverages "context" toward improving detection. In particular,
  we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection
  of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our
  method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships
  to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context
  model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve
  our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method
  for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present
  results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and
  on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant
  improvements over state-of-the-art detectors.
