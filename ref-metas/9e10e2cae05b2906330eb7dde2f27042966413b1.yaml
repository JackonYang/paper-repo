paperAbstract: Even as pre-trained language encoders such as BERT are shared across
  many tasks, the output layers of question answering and text classification models
  are significantly different. Span decoders are frequently used for question answering
  and fixed-class, classification layers for text classification. We show that this
  distinction is not necessary, and that both can be unified as span extraction. A
  unified, span-extraction approach leads to superior or comparable performance in
  multi-task learning, low-data and supplementary supervised pretraining experiments
  on several text classification and question answering benchmarks.
