paperAbstract: "Deep belief nets have been successful in modeling handwritten characters,\
  \ but it has proved more difficult to apply them to real images. The problem lies\
  \ in the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which is used as a module for learning\
  \ deep belief nets one layer at a time. The Gaussian-Binary RBMs that have been\
  \ used to model real-valued data are not a good way to model the covariance structure\
  \ of natural images. We propose a factored 3-way RBM that uses the states of its\
  \ hidden units to represent abnormalities in the local covariance structure of an\
  \ image. This provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple/complex\
  \ cell architecture. Our model learns binary features that work very well for object\
  \ recognition on the \u201Ctiny images\u201D data set. Even better features are\
  \ obtained by then using standard binary RBM\u2019s to learn a deeper model."
