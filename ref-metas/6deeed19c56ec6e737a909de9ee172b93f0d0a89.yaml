paperAbstract: A pictorial structure is a collection of parts arranged in a deformable
  configuration. Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the
  deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs
  of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they
  have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been
  due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to
  images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global
  match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial
  structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions
  of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems.
  We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car.
