paperAbstract: An influence diagram is a graphical structure for modeling uncertain
  variables and decisions and explicitly revealing probabilistic dependence and the
  flow of information. It is an intuitive framework in which to formulate problems
  as perceived by decision makers and to incorporate the knowledge of experts. At
  the same time, it is a precise description of information that can be stored and
  manipulated by a computer. We develop an algorithm that can evaluate any well-formed
  influence diagram and determine the optimal policy for its decisions. Since the
  diagram can be analyzed directly, there is no need to construct other representations
  such as a decision tree. As a result, the analysis can be performed using the decision
  maker's perspective on the problem. Questions of sensitivity and the value of information
  are natural and easily posed. Modifications to the model suggested by such analyses
  can be made directly to the problem formulation, and then evaluated directly.
