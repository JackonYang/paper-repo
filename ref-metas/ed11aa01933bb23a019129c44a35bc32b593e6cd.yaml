paperAbstract: The ability to accurately detect those areas in plain text documents
  that consist of contiguous text is an important pre- process to many applications.
  This paper introduces a novel method that uses both spatial and linguistic knowledge
  in an accurate manner to provide an initial analysis of the document. This initial
  analysis may then be extended to provide a complete analysis of the text areas in
  the document.
