paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nEugene Charniak breaks new ground in artificial\
  \ intelligence research by presenting statistical language processing from an artificial\
  \ intelligence point of view in a text for researchers and scientists with a traditional\
  \ computer science background. \nNew, exacting empirical methods are needed to break\
  \ the deadlock in such areas of artificial intelligence as robotics, knowledge representation,\
  \ machine learning, machine translation, and natural language processing (NLP).\
  \ It is time, Charniak observes, to switch paradigms. This text introduces statistical\
  \ language processing techniques -- word tagging, parsing with probabilistic context\
  \ free grammars, grammar induction, syntactic disambiguation, semantic word classes,\
  \ word-sense disambiguation -- along with the underlying mathematics and chapter\
  \ exercises. \nCharniak points out that as a method of attacking NLP problems, the\
  \ statistical approach has several advantages. It is grounded in real text and therefore\
  \ promises to produce usable results, and it offers an obvious way to approach learning:\
  \ \"one simply gathers statistics.\" \nLanguage, Speech, and Communication"
