paperAbstract: Model-based recognition and motion tracking depend upon the ability
  to solve for projection and model parameters that will best fit a 3-D model to matching
  2-D image features. The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle
  objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters
  representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical
  stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in
  the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there
  are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used
  to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based
  vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous
  methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized
  objects. >
