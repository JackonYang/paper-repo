paperAbstract: 'Video OCR is a technique that can greatly help to locate topics of
  interest in a large digital news video archive via the automatic extraction and
  reading of captions and annotations. News captions generally provide vital search
  information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions
  of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos
  are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply
  an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters
  to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation
  method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation.
  The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing
  video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding
  techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content.'
