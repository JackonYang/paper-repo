paperAbstract: Since most current scene understanding approaches operate either on
  the 2D image or using a surface-based representation, they do not allow reasoning
  about the physical constraints within the 3D scene. Inspired by the "Blocks World"
  work in the 1960's, we present a qualitative physical representation of an outdoor
  scene where objects have volume and mass, and relationships describe 3D structure
  and mechanical configurations. Our representation allows us to apply powerful global
  geometric constraints between 3D volumes as well as the laws of statics in a qualitative
  manner. We also present a novel iterative "interpretation-by-synthesis" approach
  where, starting from an empty ground plane, we progressively "build up" a physically-plausible
  3D interpretation of the image. For surface layout estimation, our method demonstrates
  an improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art [9]. But more importantly,
  our approach automatically generates 3D parse graphs which describe qualitative
  geometric and mechanical properties of objects and relationships between objects
  within an image.
