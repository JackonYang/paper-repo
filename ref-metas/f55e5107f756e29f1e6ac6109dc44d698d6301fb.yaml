paperAbstract: Gradient descent algorithms in recurrent neural networks can have problems
  when the network dynamics experience bifurcations in the course of learning. The
  possible hazards caused by the bifurcations of the network dynamics and the learning
  equations are investigated. The roles of teacher forcing, preprogramming of network
  structures, and the approximate learning algorithms are discussed.<<ETX>>
