paperAbstract: This paper presents PDF-TREX, an heuristic approach for table recognition
  and extraction from PDF documents.The heuristics starts from an initial set of basic
  content elements and aligns and groups them, in bottom-up way by considering only
  their spatial features, in order to identify tabular arrangements of information.
  The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a
  2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped
  by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of
  tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach
  is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF
  document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be
  further processed for understanding table and document contents.
