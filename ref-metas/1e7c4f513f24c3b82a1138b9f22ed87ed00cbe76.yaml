paperAbstract: 'We propose a network architecture which uses a single internal layer
  of locally-tuned processing units to learn both classification tasks and real-valued
  function approximations (Moody and Darken 1988). We consider training such networks
  in a completely supervised manner, but abandon this approach in favor of a more
  computationally efficient hybrid learning method which combines self-organized and
  supervised learning. Our networks learn faster than backpropagation for two reasons:
  the local representations ensure that only a few units respond to any given input,
  thus reducing computational overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather
  than nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence. Unlike many existing methods
  for data analysis, our network architecture and learning rules are truly adaptive
  and are thus appropriate for real-time use.'
