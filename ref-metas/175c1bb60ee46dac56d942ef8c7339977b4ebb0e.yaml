paperAbstract: This paper presents a Support Vector Method for optimizing multivariate
  nonlinear performance measures like the F1-score. Taking a multivariate prediction
  approach, we give an algorithm with which such multivariate SVMs can be trained
  in polynomial time for large classes of potentially non-linear performance measures,
  in particular ROCArea and all measures that can be computed from the contingency
  table. The conventional classification SVM arises as a special case of our method.
