paperAbstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently,\
  \ making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making.\
  \ This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have\
  \ fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics\
  \ of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain\
  \ out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's\
  \ experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable\
  \ challenge for modern AI. \nThe following is part position paper, part review,\
  \ and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top\
  \ priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations\
  \ and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature\
  \ and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between \"hand-engineering\"\
  \ and \"end-to-end\" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits\
  \ from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive\
  \ biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities,\
  \ relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the\
  \ AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes\
  \ and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and\
  \ provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and\
  \ producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational\
  \ reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated,\
  \ interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper,\
  \ we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks,\
  \ with demonstrations of how to use them in practice."
