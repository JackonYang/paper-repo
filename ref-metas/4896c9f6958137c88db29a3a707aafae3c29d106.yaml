paperAbstract: This paper introduces a hybrid, two-stage approach to semantic image
  segmentation. In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse
  plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking
  model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use
  much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic
  model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply
  producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed
  approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48%) on the challenging VOC
  2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are
  possible with such an approach.
