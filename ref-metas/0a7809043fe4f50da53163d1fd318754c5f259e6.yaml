paperAbstract: In this paper, I summarize research in document layout analysis carried
  out over the last few years in our laboratory. Correct document layout analysis
  is a key step in document capture conversions into electronic formats, optical character
  recognition (OCR), information retrieval from scanned documents, appearance-based
  document retrieval, and reformatting of documents for on-screen display. We have
  developed a number of novel geometric algorithms and statistical methods. Layout
  analysis systems built from these algorithms are applicable to a wide variety of
  languages and layouts, and have proven to be robust to the presence of noise and
  spurious features in a page image. The system itself consists of reusable and independent
  software modules that can be reconfigured to be adapted to different languages and
  applications. Currently, we are using them for electronic book and document capture
  applications. If there is commercial or government demand, we are interested in
  adapting these tools to information retrieval and intelligence applications.
