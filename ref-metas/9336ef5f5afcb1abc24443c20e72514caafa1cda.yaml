paperAbstract: 'We present a novel categorical object detection scheme that uses only
  local contour-based features. A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture
  is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented
  images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage
  bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training
  against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates
  a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly
  chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive
  with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object
  articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application
  of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised
  learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting
  features and estimating per-feature parameters.'
