paperAbstract: Deep Bidirectional LSTM (DBLSTM) recurrent neural networks have recently
  been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on the TIMIT speech database. However,
  the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions,
  which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition
  systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard
  neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally
  good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep
  network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement
  in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in
  framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to
  be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation
  needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level
  accuracy towards better word error rates.
