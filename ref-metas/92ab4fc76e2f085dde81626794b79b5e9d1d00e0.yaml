paperAbstract: Abstract The interpretation of the movements of articulated bodies
  in image sequences is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. In
  this contribution, we introduce a model-based approach for the recognition of pedestrians.
  We represent the human body by a 3D-model consisting of cylinders, whereas for modelling
  the movement of walking we use data from medical motion studies. The estimation
  of model parameters in consecutive images is done by applying a Kalman filter. Experimental
  results are shown for synthetic as well as for real image data.
