paperAbstract: 'We present a tree-based reparameterization (TRP) framework that provides
  a new conceptual view of a large class of algorithms for computing approximate marginals
  in graphs with cycles. This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product
  algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can
  be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails
  refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph
  (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an
  alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or
  approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights
  an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization
  algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The
  perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization
  of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of
  these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution,
  in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact
  expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with
  cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our
  analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also
  develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that
  govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends
  naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants)
  via the notion of hypertree reparameterization.'
