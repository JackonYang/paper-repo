paperAbstract: A new hybrid page layout analysis algorithm is proposed, which uses
  bottom-up methods to form an initial data-type hypothesis and locate the tab-stops
  that were used when the page was formatted. The detected tab-stops, are used to
  deduce the column layout of the page. The column layout is then applied in a top-down
  manner to impose structure and reading-order on the detected regions. The complete
  C++ source code implementation is available as part of the Tesseract open source
  OCR engine at http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr.
