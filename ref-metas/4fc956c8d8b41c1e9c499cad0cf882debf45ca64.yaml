paperAbstract: A large class of problems can be formulated in terms of the assignment
  of labels to objects. Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and
  noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling
  processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use
  of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize
  the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency
  in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted
  circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the
  search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation
  labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on
  variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings
  is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical
  to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the
  more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this
  operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our
  new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard
  methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence
  and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described.
