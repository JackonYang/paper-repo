paperAbstract: "Natural language questions are inherently compositional, and many\
  \ are most easily answered by reasoning about their decomposition into modular sub-problems.\
  \ For example, to answer \u201Cis there an equal number of balls and boxes?\u201D\
  \ we can look for balls, look for boxes, count them, and compare the results. The\
  \ recently proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) architecture [3, 2] implements this\
  \ approach to question answering by parsing questions into linguistic substructures\
  \ and assembling question-specific deep networks from smaller modules that each\
  \ solve one subtask. However, existing NMN implementations rely on brittle off-the-shelf\
  \ parsers, and are restricted to the module configurations proposed by these parsers\
  \ rather than learning them from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module\
  \ Networks (N2NMNs), which learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific\
  \ network layouts without the aid of a parser. Our model learns to generate network\
  \ structures (by imitating expert demonstrations) while simultaneously learning\
  \ network parameters (using the downstream task loss). Experimental results on the\
  \ new CLEVR dataset targeted at compositional question answering show that N2NMNs\
  \ achieve an error reduction of nearly 50% relative to state-of-theart attentional\
  \ approaches, while discovering interpretable network architectures specialized\
  \ for each question."
