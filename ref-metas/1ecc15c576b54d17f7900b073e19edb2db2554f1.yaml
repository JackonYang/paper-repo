paperAbstract: We propose a deep learning strategy for scene parsing, i.e. to asssign
  a class label to each pixel of an image. We investigate the use of deep convolutional
  network for modeling the complex scene label structures, relying on a supervised
  greedy learning strategy. Compared to standard approaches based on CRFs, our strategy
  does not need hand-crafted features, allows modeling more complex spatial dependencies
  and has a lower inference cost. Experiments over the MSRC benchmark and the LabelMe
  dataset show the effectiveness of our approach.
