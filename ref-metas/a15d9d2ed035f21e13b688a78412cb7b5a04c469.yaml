paperAbstract: Deformable part-based models [1, 2] achieve state-of-the-art performance
  for object detection, but rely on heuristic initialization during training due to
  the optimization of non-convex cost function. This paper investigates limitations
  of such an initialization and extends earlier methods using additional supervision.
  We explore strong supervision in terms of annotated object parts and use it to (i)
  improve model initialization, (ii) optimize model structure, and (iii) handle partial
  occlusions. Our method is able to deal with sub-optimal and incomplete annotations
  of object parts and is shown to benefit from semi-supervised learning setups where
  part-level annotation is provided for a fraction of positive examples only. Experimental
  results are reported for the detection of six animal classes in PASCAL VOC 2007
  and 2010 datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in detection performance
  compared to the LSVM [1] and the Poselet [3] object detectors.
