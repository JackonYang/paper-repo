paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a database containing ''ground truth'' segmentations
  produced by humans for images of a wide variety of natural scenes. We define an
  error measure which quantifies the consistency between segmentations of differing
  granularities and find that different human segmentations of the same image are
  highly consistent. Use of this dataset is demonstrated in two applications: (1)
  evaluating the performance of segmentation algorithms and (2) measuring probability
  distributions associated with Gestalt grouping factors as well as statistics of
  image region properties.'
