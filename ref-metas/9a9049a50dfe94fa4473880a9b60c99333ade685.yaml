paperAbstract: We propose a two-class classification model for grouping. Human segmented
  natural images are used as positive examples. Negative examples of grouping are
  constructed by randomly matching human segmentations and images. In a preprocessing
  stage an image is over-segmented into super-pixels. We define a variety of features
  derived from the classical Gestalt cues, including contour, texture, brightness
  and good continuation. Information-theoretic analysis is applied to evaluate the
  power of these grouping cues. We train a linear classifier to combine these features.
  To demonstrate the power of the classification model, a simple algorithm is used
  to randomly search for good segmentations. Results are shown on a wide range of
  images.
