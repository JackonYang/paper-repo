paperAbstract: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of simultaneous pedestrian
  detection and ground-plane estimation from video while walking through a busy pedestrian
  zone. Our proposed system integrates robust stereo depth cues, ground-plane estimation,
  and appearance-based object detection in a principled fashion using a graphical
  model. Object-object occlusions lead to complex interactions in this model that
  make an exact solution computationally intractable. We therefore propose a novel
  iterative approach that first infers scene geometry using belief propagation and
  then resolves interactions between objects using a global optimization procedure.
  This approach leads to a robust solution in few iterations, while allowing object
  detection to benefit from geometry estimation and vice versa. We quantitatively
  evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on several challenging test sequences
  showing strolls through busy shopping streets. Comparisons to various baseline systems
  show that it outperforms both a system using no scene geometry and one just relying
  on structure-from-motion without dense stereo.
