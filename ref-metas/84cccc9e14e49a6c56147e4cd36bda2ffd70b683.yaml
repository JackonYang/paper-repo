paperAbstract: Recently, Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) proposed a method for constructing
  kernel functions from probabilistic models. Their so-called Fisher kernel has been
  combined with discriminative classifiers such as support vector machines and applied
  successfully in, for example, DNA and protein analysis. Whereas the Fisher kernel
  is calculated from the marginal log-likelihood, we propose the TOP kernel derived
  from tangent vectors of posterior log-odds. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical
  framework on feature extractors from probabilistic models and use it for analyzing
  the TOP kernel. In experiments, our new discriminative TOP kernel compares favorably
  to the Fisher kernel.
