paperAbstract: We consider the problem of feature-based face recognition in the setting
  where only a single example of each face is available for training. The mixture-distance
  technique we introduce achieves a recognition rate of 95% on a database of 685 people
  in which each face is represented by 30 measured distances. This is currently the
  best recorded recognition rate for a feature-based system applied to a database
  of this size. By comparison, nearest neighbor search using Euclidean distance yields
  84%. In our work a novel distance function is constructed based on local second
  order statistics as estimated by modeling the training data as a mixture of normal
  densities. We report on the results from mixtures of several sizes. We demonstrate
  that a flat mixture of mixtures performs as well as the best model and therefore
  represents an effective solution to the model selection problem. A mixture perspective
  is also taken for individual Gaussians to choose between first order (variance)
  and second order (covariance) models. Here an approximation to flat combination
  is proposed and seen to perform well in practice. Our results demonstrate that even
  in the absence of multiple training examples for each class, it is sometimes possible
  to infer from a statistical model of training data, a significantly improved distance
  function for use in pattern recognition.
