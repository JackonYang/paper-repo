paperAbstract: "Almost nothing can be deduced about a general three-dimensional surface\
  \ given only its occluding contours in an image, yet contour information is easily\
  \ and effectively used by us to infer the shape of a surface. Therefore, implicit\
  \ in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about\
  \ the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction\
  \ between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface;\
  \ and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the\
  \ viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved\
  \ that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming\
  \ that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding\
  \ the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones\
  \ into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide\
  \ one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D\
  \ representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."
