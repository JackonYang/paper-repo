paperAbstract: We introduce the problem of zero-data learning, where a model must
  generalize to classes or tasks for which no training data are available and only
  a description of the classes or tasks are provided. Zero-data learning is useful
  for problems where the set of classes to distinguish or tasks to solve is very large
  and is not entirely covered by the training data. The main contributions of this
  work lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in
  an experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that
  generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work
  of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and
  a multitask ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude
  by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how to
  extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification
  for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero
  examples).
