paperAbstract: A multiple classifier system is a powerful solution to difficult pattern
  recognition problems involving large class sets and noisy input because it allows
  simultaneous use of arbitrary feature descriptors and classification procedures.
  Decisions by the classifiers can be represented as rankings of classifiers and different
  instances of a problem. The rankings can be combined by methods that either reduce
  or rerank a given set of classes. An intersection method and union method are proposed
  for class set reduction. Three methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count,
  and logistic regression are proposed for class set reranking. These methods have
  been tested in applications of degraded machine-printed characters and works from
  large lexicons, resulting in substantial improvement in overall correctness. >
