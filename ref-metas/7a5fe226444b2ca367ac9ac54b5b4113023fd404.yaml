paperAbstract: We present a novel model for human action categorization. A video sequence
  is represented as a collection of spatial and spatial-temporal features by extracting
  static and dynamic interest points. We propose a hierarchical model that can be
  characterized as a constellation of bags-of-features and that is able to combine
  both spatial and spatial-temporal features. Given a novel video sequence, the model
  is able to categorize human actions in a frame-by-frame basis. We test the model
  on a publicly available human action dataset [2] and show that our new method performs
  well on the classification task. We also conducted control experiments to show that
  the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification
  performance over bag of feature models. An additional experiment shows that using
  both dynamic and static features provides a richer representation of human actions
  when compared to the use of a single feature type, as demonstrated by our evaluation
  in the classification task.
