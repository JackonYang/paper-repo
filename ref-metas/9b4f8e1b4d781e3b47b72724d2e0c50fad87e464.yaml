paperAbstract: Current methods for learning graphical models with latent variables
  and a fixed structure estimate optimal values for the model parameters. Whereas
  this approach usually produces overfitting and suboptimal generalization performance,
  carrying out the Bayesian program of computing the full posterior distributions
  over the parameters remains a difficult problem. Moreover, learning the structure
  of models with latent variables, for which the Bayesian approach is crucial, is
  yet a harder problem. In this paper I present the Variational Bayes framework, which
  provides a solution to these problems. This approach approximates full posterior
  distributions over model parameters and structures, as well as latent variables,
  in an analytical manner without resorting to sampling methods. Unlike in the Laplace
  approximation, these posteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs
  to be computed. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization
  algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. I demonstrate that this algorithm
  can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including unsupervised
  clustering and blind source separation.
