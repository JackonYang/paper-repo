paperAbstract: "Traditional classification approaches generalize poorly on image classification\
  \ tasks, because of the high dimensionality of the feature space. This paper shows\
  \ that Support Vector Machines (SVM) can generalize well on difficult image classification\
  \ problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed\
  \ RBF kernels of the form K(x,y) = e\u2212\u03C1 P i |x i \u2212y i | with a \u2264\
  \ 1 and b \u2264 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from\
  \ the Corel Stock Photo Collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial\
  \ or Gaussian RBF kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the\
  \ input xi \u2192 x a i improves the performance of linear SVMs to such an extend\
  \ that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels. keywords:\
