paperAbstract: We present the MAC network, a novel fully differentiable neural network
  architecture, designed to facilitate explicit and expressive reasoning. MAC moves
  away from monolithic black-box neural architectures towards a design that encourages
  both transparency and versatility. The model approaches problems by decomposing
  them into a series of attention-based reasoning steps, each performed by a novel
  recurrent Memory, Attention, and Composition (MAC) cell that maintains a separation
  between control and memory. By stringing the cells together and imposing structural
  constraints that regulate their interaction, MAC effectively learns to perform iterative
  reasoning processes that are directly inferred from the data in an end-to-end approach.
  We demonstrate the model's strength, robustness and interpretability on the challenging
  CLEVR dataset for visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.9% accuracy,
  halving the error rate of the previous best model. More importantly, we show that
  the model is computationally-efficient and data-efficient, in particular requiring
  5x less data than existing models to achieve strong results.
