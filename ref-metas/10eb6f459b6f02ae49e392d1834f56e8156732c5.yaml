paperAbstract: The world we live in is labeled extensively for the benefit of humans.
  Yet, to date, robots have made little use of human readable text as a resource.
  In this paper we aim to draw attention to text as a readily available source of
  semantic information in robotics by implementing a system which allows robots to
  read visible text in natural scene images and to use this knowledge to interpret
  the content of a given scene. The reliable detection and parsing of text in natural
  scene images is an active area of research and remains a non-trivial problem. We
  extend a commonly adopted approach based on boosting for the detection and optical
  character recognition (OCR) for the parsing of text by a probabilistic error correction
  scheme incorporating a sensor-model for our pipeline. In order to interpret the
  scene content we introduce a generative model which explains spotted text in terms
  of arbitrary search terms. This allows the robot to estimate the relevance of a
  given scene with respect to arbitrary queries such as, for example, whether it is
  looking at a bank or a restaurant. We present results from images recorded by a
  robot in a busy cityscape.
