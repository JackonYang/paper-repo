paperAbstract: "Selectional constraints are limitations on the applicability of predicates\
  \ to arguments. For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically\
  \ well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that\
  \ can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic\
  \ account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal\
  \ requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization\
  \ of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead\
  \ that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership,\
  \ where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than\
  \ in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms\
  \ of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional\
  \ behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual\
  \ classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of\
  \ relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation\
  \ of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for\
  \ an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that\
  \ argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore\
  \ its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why\
  \ some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\"\
  ) and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed\
  \ informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the\
  \ object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a\
  \ relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed\
  \ the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of\
  \ computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications\
  \ of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently\
  \ begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing;\
  \ the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that\
  \ often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual\
  \ relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the\
  \ information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components\
  \ in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural\
  \ language processing."
