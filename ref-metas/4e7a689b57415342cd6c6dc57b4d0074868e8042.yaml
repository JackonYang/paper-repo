paperAbstract: In this paper, we study the problem of fine-grained image categorization.
  The goal of our method is to explore fine image statistics and identify the discriminative
  image patches for recognition. We achieve this goal by combining two ideas, discriminative
  feature mining and randomization. Discriminative feature mining allows us to model
  the detailed information that distinguishes different classes of images, while randomization
  allows us to handle the huge feature space and prevents over-fitting. We propose
  a random forest with discriminative decision trees algorithm, where every tree node
  is a discriminative classifier that is trained by combining the information in this
  node as well as all upstream nodes. Our method is tested on both subordinate categorization
  and activity recognition datasets. Experimental results show that our method identifies
  semantically meaningful visual information and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms
  on various datasets.
