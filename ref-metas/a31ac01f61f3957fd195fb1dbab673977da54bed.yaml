paperAbstract: 'In the QBIC (Query By Image Content) project we are studying methods
  to query large on-line image databases using the images'' content as the basis of
  the queries. Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of
  image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (\Give me other
  images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one"), photo-journalism (\Give
  me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom"), and many others in
  art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. We describe a set of novel features
  and similarity measures allowing query by color, texture, and shape of image object.
  We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the QBIC system with normalized precision and
  recall experiments on test databases containing over 1000 images and 1000 objects
  populated from commercially available photo clip art images, and of images of airplane
  silhouettes. We also consider the e cient indexing of these features, speci cally
  addressing two problems: (a) for our feature vectors, the desired distance function
  is not Euclidean, and/or (b) the vectors have high dimensionality. We propose novel,
  general solutions to both problems by allowing some \false alarms" (\false hits",
  or \false positives") but no false dismissals. For the rst problem, we introduce
  a new theorem that makes indexing possible by bounding the non-Euclidean, full cross-term
  quadratic distance expression with a simple Euclidean distance. For the second,
  we illustrate how orthogonal transforms, such as the Karhunen Loeve transform, can
  help reduce the dimensionality, without introducing false dismissals. The resulting
  QBIC system o ers high quality of output, and signi cant speedup over straightforward
  indexing alternatives. The system is implemented in X/Motif and C running on an
  RS/6000. On sabbatical from Univ. of Maryland, College Park. His work was partially
  supported by SRC, by the National Science Foundation under the grant IRI-8958546
  (PYI).'
