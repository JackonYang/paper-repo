paperAbstract: A method is presented to locate an object in a color image, or more
  precisely, to select a set of likely locations for the object. The model is assumed
  to be of known color, which permits the use of color-space processing. A new method
  is presented, which exploits more information than the previous backprojection algorithm
  of Swain and Ballard at a competitive complexity. The new algorithm is based on
  matching local histograms with the model, instead of directly replacing pixels with
  a confidence that they belong to the object. It is proved that a simple version
  of this algorithm degenerates into backprojection in the worst case. The authors
  show how to estimate the scale of the model. The use of co-occurrence histograms
  is proposed to deal with cases where important color variations can be expected.<<ETX>>
