paperAbstract: "When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information\
  \ that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image\
  \ operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing\
  \ this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels\
  \ when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.A novel\
  \ concept of a scale-space edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points\
  \ in scale-space at which: (i) the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in\
  \ the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength of the edge\
  \ response is locally maximal over scales. An important consequence of this definition\
  \ is that it allows the scale levels to vary along the edge. Two specific measures\
  \ of edge strength are analyzed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential\
  \ expression derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction.\
  \ For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors, by expressing\
  \ them in terms of so-called \u03B3-normalized derivatives, an immediate consequence\
  \ of this definition is that the edge detector will adapt its scale levels to the\
  \ local image structure. Specifically, sharp edges will be detected at fine scales\
  \ so as to reduce the shape distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently\
  \ coarse scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model is a\
  \ valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.Since the scale-space\
  \ edge is defined from the intersection of two zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space,\
  \ the edges will by definition form closed curves. This simplifies selection of\
  \ salient edges, and a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the\
  \ edge strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated with\
  \ each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the edge.With just slight\
  \ modifications, similar ideas can be used for formulating ridge detectors with\
  \ automatic selection, having the characteristic property that the selected scales\
  \ on a scale-space ridge instead reflect the width of the ridge.It is shown how\
  \ the methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual front-end\
  \ operations, and the validity of the approach is supported by theoretical analysis\
  \ as well as experiments on real-world and synthetic data."
