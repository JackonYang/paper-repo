paperAbstract: A document image analysis toolbox including a collection of data structures
  and algorithms to support a variety of applications, is described in this paper.
  An experimental environment is built to allow developers to develop, test and optimize
  their algorithms and systems. Appropriate and quantitative performance metrics for
  each kind of information a document analysis technique infers have been developed.
  The performance of each algorithm has been evaluated based on these metrics and
  the UW-III document image database which contains a total of 1600 English document
  images randomly selected from scientific and technical journals.
