paperAbstract: Structure analysis of table form document is importantbecause printed
  documents and also electronical documentsonly provide geometrical layout and lexical
  information explicitly.To handle these documents automatically, logicalstructure
  information is necessary. In this paper, we firstpropose a general representation
  of table form documentbased on XML, which contains both structure and layoutinformation.
  Next, we present structure analysis systembased on graph grammar which represents
  document structureknowledge. As the relation between adjacent fields intable form
  documents become two dimensional, two dimensionalnotation is necessary to denote
  structural knowledge.Therefore, we adopt two dimensional graph grammar to denotethem.
  By using grammar notation, we can easily modifyand keep consistency of it, as the
  rules are relatively simple.Another advantage of using grammar notation is that,it
  can be used for generating documents only from logicalstructure. Experimental results
  have shown that the systemsuccessfully analyzed several kinds of table forms.
