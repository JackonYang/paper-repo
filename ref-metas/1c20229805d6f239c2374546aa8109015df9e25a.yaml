paperAbstract: Computational models of the human stereo system can provide insight
  into general information processing constraints that apply to any stereo system,
  either artificial or biological. In 1977 Marr and Poggio proposed one such computational
  model, which was characterized as matching certain feature points in difference-of-Gaussian
  filtered images and using the information obtained by matching coarser resolution
  representations to restrict the search space for matching finer resolution representations.
  An implementation of the algorithm and its testing on a range of images was reported
  in 1980. Since then a number of psychophysical experiments have suggested possible
  refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational
  experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial
  photographs, have led to a number of modifications. In this paper, we present a
  version of the Marr-Poggio-Grimson algorithm that embodies these modifications,
  and we illustrate its performance on a series of natural images.
