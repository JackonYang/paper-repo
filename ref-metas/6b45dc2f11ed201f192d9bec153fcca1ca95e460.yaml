paperAbstract: A bidirectional texture function (BTF) describes image texture as it
  varies with viewing and illumination direction. Many real world surfaces such as
  skin, fur, gravel, etc. exhibit fine-scale geometric surface detail. Accordingly,
  variations in appearance with viewing and illumination direction may be quite complex
  due to local foreshortening, masking and shadowing. Representations of surface texture
  that support robust recognition must account for these effects. We construct a representation
  which captures the underlying statistical distribution of features in the image
  texture as well as the variations in this distribution with viewing and illumination
  direction. The representation combines clustering to learn characteristic image
  features and principle components analysis to reduce the space of feature histograms.
  This representation is based on a core image set as determined by a quantitative
  evaluation of importance of individual images in the overall representation. The
  result is a compact representation and a recognition method where a single novel
  image of unknown viewing and illumination direction can be classified efficiently.
  The CUReT (Columbia-Utrecht reflectance and texture) database is used as a test
  set for evaluation of these methods.
