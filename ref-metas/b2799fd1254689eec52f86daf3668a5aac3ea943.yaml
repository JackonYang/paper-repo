paperAbstract: "Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for treelike networks\
  \ but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops,\
  \ including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm\
  \ or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that\
  \ BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known\
  \ as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP\
  \ fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate\
  \ inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made\
  \ in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi\
  \ and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations,\
  \ of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our\
  \ analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi\
  \ approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more\
  \ accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate\
  \ such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much\
  \ more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."
