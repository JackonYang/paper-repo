paperAbstract: 'We study the computational feasibility of learning boolean expressions
  from examples. Our goals are to prove results and develop general techniques that
  shed light on the boundary between the classes of expressions that are learnable
  in polynomial time and those that are apparently not. The elucidation of this boundary,
  for boolean expressions and possibly other knowledge representations, is an example
  of the potential contribution of complexity theory to artificial intelligence. We
  employ the distribution-free model of learning introduced in /lo]. A more complete
  discussion and justification of this model can be found in [4,10,11,12]. [4] includes
  some discussion that is relevant more particularly to infinite representations,
  such as geometric ones, rather than the finite case of boolean functions. For other
  recent related work see [1,2,7,&g]. The results of this paper fall into three categories:
  closure properties of learnable classes, negative results, and distribution-specific
  positive results. The closure properties are of two kinds. In section 3 we discuss
  closure under boolean operations on the members of the learnable classes. The assumption
  that the classes are learnable from positive or negative ex-'
