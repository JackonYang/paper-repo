paperAbstract: 'Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently been applied
  successfully to a variety of vision and multimedia tasks, thus driving development
  of novel solutions in several application domains. Document analysis is a particularly
  promising area for DCNNs: indeed, the number of available digital documents has
  reached unprecedented levels, and humans are no longer able to discover and retrieve
  all the information contained in these documents without the help of automation.
  Under this scenario, DCNNs offers a viable solution to automate the information
  extraction process from digital documents. Within the realm of information extraction
  from documents, detection of tables and charts is particularly needed as they contain
  a visual summary of the most valuable information contained in a document. For a
  complete automation of visual information extraction process from tables and charts,
  it is necessary to develop techniques that localize them and identify precisely
  their boundaries. In this paper we aim at solving the table/chart detection task
  through an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks, graphical
  models and saliency concepts. In particular, we propose a saliency-based fully-convolutional
  neural network performing multi-scale reasoning on visual cues followed by a fully-connected
  conditional random field (CRF) for localizing tables and charts in digital/digitized
  documents. Performance analysis carried out on an extended version of ICDAR 2013
  (with annotated charts as well as tables) shows that our approach yields promising
  results, outperforming existing models.'
