paperAbstract: 'Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying
  objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph,
  an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable
  textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their
  application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data:
  photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs
  of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial
  imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules:
  one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision
  rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a
  min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts,
  a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for
  the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent
  for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural
  features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification
  applications.'
