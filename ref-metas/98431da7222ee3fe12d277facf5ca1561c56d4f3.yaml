paperAbstract: Nonparametric density gradient estimation using a generalized kernel
  approach is investigated. Conditions on the kernel functions are derived to guarantee
  asymptotic unbiasedness, consistency, and uniform consistency of the estimates.
  The results are generalized to obtain a simple mcan-shift estimate that can be extended
  in a k -nearest-neighbor approach. Applications of gradient estimation to pattern
  recognition are presented using clustering and intrinsic dimensionality problems,
  with the ultimate goal of providing further understanding of these problems in terms
  of density gradients.
