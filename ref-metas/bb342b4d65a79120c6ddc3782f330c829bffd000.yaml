paperAbstract: This paper introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing
  images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint
  changes and nonrigid deformations. At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set
  of affine-invariant local patches is extracted from the image. This spatial selection
  process permits the computation of characteristic scale and neighborhood shape for
  every texture element. The proposed texture representation is evaluated in retrieval
  and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a collection of photographs
  of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.
