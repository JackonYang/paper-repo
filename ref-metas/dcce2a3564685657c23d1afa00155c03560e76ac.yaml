paperAbstract: A directed acyclic graph or influence diagram is frequently used as
  a representation for qualitative knowledge in some domains in which expert system
  techniques have been applied, and conditional probability tables on appropriate
  sets of variables form the quantitative part of the accumulated experience. It is
  shown how one can introduce imprecision into such probabilities as a data base of
  cases accumulates. By exploiting the graphical structure, the updating can be performed
  locally, either approximately or exactly, and the setup makes it possible to take
  advantage of a range of well-established statistical techniques. As examples we
  discuss discrete models, models based on Dirichlet distributions and models of the
  logistic regression type.
