paperAbstract: Developing effective methods for automated annotation of digital pictures
  continues to challenge computer scientists. The capability of annotating pictures
  by computers can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, including
  Web image search, online picture-sharing communities, and scientific experiments.
  In this work, the authors developed new optimization and estimation techniques to
  address two fundamental problems in machine learning. These new techniques serve
  as the basis for the automatic linguistic indexing of pictures - real time (ALIPR)
  system of fully automatic and high-speed annotation for online pictures. In particular,
  the D2-clustering method, in the same spirit as K-Means for vectors, is developed
  to group objects represented by bags of weighted vectors. Moreover, a generalized
  mixture modeling technique (kernel smoothing as a special case) for nonvector data
  is developed using the novel concept of hypothetical local mapping (HLM). ALIPR
  has been tested by thousands of pictures from an Internet photo-sharing site, unrelated
  to the source of those pictures used in the training process. Its performance has
  also been studied at an online demonstration site, where arbitrary users provide
  pictures of their choices and indicate the correctness of each annotation word.
  The experimental results show that a single computer processor can suggest annotation
  terms in real time and with good accuracy.
