paperAbstract: We present a new view of image segmentation by pairwise similarities.
  We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation
  shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic
  foundation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally
  from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning
  the similarity function as a combination of features.
