paperAbstract: This paper describes ongoing work on a new approach for language modeling
  for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Almost all state.. o. f-the-art
  systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle
  problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never
  observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off
  to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying
  out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of
  the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words
  onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist
  language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech
  recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity
  and word error rate.
