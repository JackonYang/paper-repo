paperAbstract: We propose an unsupervised method for learning multi-stage hierarchies
  of sparse convolutional features. While sparse coding has become an increasingly
  popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch
  level. Applying the resulting filters convolutionally results in highly redundant
  codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally
  over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors
  at neighboring locations and improves the efficiency of the overall representation.
  In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features,
  our method trains an efficient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasi-sparse features
  from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented
  edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters,
  including center-surround filters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented
  grating detectors. We show that using these filters in multistage convolutional
  network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and
  detection tasks.
