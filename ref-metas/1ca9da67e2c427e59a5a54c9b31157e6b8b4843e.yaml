paperAbstract: "The objective of this work is the detection of object classes, such\
  \ as airplanes or horses. Instead of using a model based on salient image fragments,\
  \ we show that object class detection is also possible using only the object's boundary.\
  \ To this end, we develop a novel learning technique to extract class-discriminative\
  \ boundary fragments. In addition to their shape, these \u201Ccodebook\u201D entries\
  \ also determine the object's centroid (in the manner of Leibe et al. [19]). Boosting\
  \ is used to select discriminative combinations of boundary fragments (weak detectors)\
  \ to form a strong \u201CBoundary-Fragment-Model\u201D (BFM) detector. The generative\
  \ aspect of the model is used to determine an approximate segmentation. \n \nWe\
  \ demonstrate the following results: (i) the BFM detector is able to represent and\
  \ detect object classes principally defined by their shape, rather than their appearance;\
  \ and (ii) in comparison with other published results on several object classes\
  \ (airplanes, cars-rear, cows) the BFM detector is able to exceed previous performances,\
  \ and to achieve this with less supervision (such as the number of training images)."
