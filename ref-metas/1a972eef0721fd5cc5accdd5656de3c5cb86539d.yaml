paperAbstract: "Abstract. We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype\
  \ image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information\
  \ in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database.\
  \ A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated\
  \ image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image\
  \ segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images\
  \ contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions\
  \ at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each\
  \ of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important\
  \ components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing\
  \ of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation\
  \ allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201Cretrieve all images\
  \ that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape\
  \ of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201D, where the individual objects\
  \ could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation\
  \ of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."
