paperAbstract: With nearly one billion online videos viewed everyday, an emerging
  new frontier in computer vision research is recognition and search in video. While
  much effort has been devoted to the collection and annotation of large scalable
  static image datasets containing thousands of image categories, human action datasets
  lag far behind. Current action recognition databases contain on the order of ten
  different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art
  performance on these datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the
  design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest
  action video database to-date with 51 action categories, which in total contain
  around 7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of sources ranging
  from digitized movies to YouTube. We use this database to evaluate the performance
  of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and explore
  the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion,
  viewpoint, video quality and occlusion.
