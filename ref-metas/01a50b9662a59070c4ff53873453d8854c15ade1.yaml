paperAbstract: We present CloudScan; an invoice analysis system that requires zero
  configuration or upfront annotation. In contrast to previous work, CloudScan does
  not rely on templates of invoice layout, instead it learns a single global model
  of invoices that naturally generalizes to unseen invoice layouts. The model is trained
  using data automatically extracted from end-user provided feedback. This automatic
  training data extraction removes the requirement for users to annotate the data
  precisely. We describe a recurrent neural network model that can capture long range
  context and compare it to a baseline logistic regression model corresponding to
  the current CloudScan production system. We train and evaluate the system on 8 important
  fields using a dataset of 326,471 invoices. The recurrent neural network and baseline
  model achieve 0.891 and 0.887 average F1 scores respectively on seen invoice layouts.
  For the harder task of unseen invoice layouts, the recurrent neural network model
  outperforms the baseline with 0.840 average F1 compared to 0.788.
