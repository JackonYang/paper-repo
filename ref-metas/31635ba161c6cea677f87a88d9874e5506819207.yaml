paperAbstract: Finding people in pictures presents a particularly difficult object
  recognition problem. We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments,
  and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints
  on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable
  model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect
  every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches
  to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of
  a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient
  projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach
  can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second
  approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies,
  with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like
  assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is
  in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images
  of people are encouraging.
