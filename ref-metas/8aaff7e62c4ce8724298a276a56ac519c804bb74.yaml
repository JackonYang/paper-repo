paperAbstract: 'Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a
  very large quadratic programming (QP) problem. This paper proposes an algorithm
  for training SVMs: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. SMO breaks the large
  QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems which are analytically
  solvable. Thus, SMO does not require a numerical QP library. SMO''s computation
  time is dominated by evaluation of the kernel, hence kernel optimizations substantially
  quicken SMO. For the MNIST database, SMO is 1.7 times as fast as PCG chunking; while
  for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be 1500 times faster than the
  PCG chunking algorithm.'
