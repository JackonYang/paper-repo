paperAbstract: In this article, we studied the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and
  MPE/MWE for discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition. We presented
  an approach that unifies the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE in a common
  rational-function form of (25). The exact structure of the rational-function form
  for each discriminative criterion was derived and studied. While the rational-function
  form of MMI has been known in the past, we provided the theoretical proof that the
  similar rational-function form exists for the objective functions of MCE and MPE/MWE.
  Moreover, we showed that the rational function forms for objective functions of
  MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE differ in the constant weighting factors CDT (s1 . . . sR)
  and these weighting factors depend only on the labeled sequence s1 . . . sR, and
  are independent of the parameter set - to be optimized. The derived rational-function
  form for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE allows the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework
  to be applied directly in discriminative learning. In the past, lack of the appropriate
  rational-function form was a difficulty for MCE and MPE/MWE, because without this
  form, the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework cannot be directly applied.
  Based on the unified rational-function form, in a tutorial style, we derived the
  GT/EBW-based parameter optimization formulas for both discrete HMMs and CDHMMs in
  discriminative learning using MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE criteria. The unifying review
  provided in this article has been based upon a large number of earlier contributions
  that have been cited and discussed throughout the article. Here we provide a brief
  summary of such background work. Extension to large-scale speech recognition tasks
  was accomplished in the work of [59] and [60]. The dissertation of [47] further
  improved the MMI criterion to that of MPE/MWE. In a parallel vein, the work of [20]
  provided an alternative approach to that of [41], with an attempt to more rigorously
  provide a CDHMM model re-estimation formula that gives positive growth of the MMI
  objective function. A crucial error of this attempt was corrected in [2] for establishing
  an existence proof of such positive growth. The main goal of this article is to
  provide an underlying foundation for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE at the objective function
  level to facilitate the development of new parameter optimization techniques and
  to incorporate other pattern recognition concepts, e.g., discriminative margins
  [66], into the current discriminative learning paradigm.
