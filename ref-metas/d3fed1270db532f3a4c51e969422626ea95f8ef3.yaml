paperAbstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) aims to recognize text in natural
  images. Inspired by a recently proposed model for general image classification,
  Recurrent Convolution Neural Network (RCNN), we propose a new architecture named
  Gated RCNN (GRCNN) for solving this problem. Its critical component, Gated Recurrent
  Convolution Layer (GRCL), is constructed by adding a gate to the Recurrent Convolution
  Layer (RCL), the critical component of RCNN. The gate controls the context modulation
  in RCL and balances the feed-forward information and the recurrent information.
  In addition, an efficient Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is built
  for sequence modeling. The GRCNN is combined with BLSTM to recognize text in natural
  images. The entire GRCNN-BLSTM model can be trained end-to-end. Experiments show
  that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets
  including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text (SVT) and ICDAR.
