paperAbstract: We develop a probability model for natural images, based on empirical
  observation of their statistics in the wavelet transform domain. Pairs of wavelet
  coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations,
  and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical
  properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are
  typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov
  model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled
  with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for
  the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical
  images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model,
  we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder),
  in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive
  arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model.
  Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction
  per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values
  based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion
  performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature.
