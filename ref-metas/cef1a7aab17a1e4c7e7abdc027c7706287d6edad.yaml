paperAbstract: Dynamic events can be regarded as long-term temporal objects, which
  are characterized by spatio-temporal features at multiple temporal scales. Based
  on this, we design a simple statistical distance measure between video sequences
  (possibly of different lengths) based on their behavioral content. This measure
  is non-parametric and can thus handle a wide range of dynamic events. We use this
  measure for isolating and clustering events within long continuous video sequences.
  This is done without prior knowledge of the types of events, their models, or their
  temporal extent. An outcome of such a clustering process is a temporal segmentation
  of long video sequences into event-consistent sub-sequences, and their grouping
  into event-consistent clusters. Our event representation and associated distance
  measure can also be used for event-based indexing into long video sequences, even
  when only one short example-clip is available. However, when multiple example-clips
  of the same event are available (either as a result of the clustering process, or
  given manually), these can be used to refine the event representation, the associated
  distance measure, and accordingly the quality of the detection and clustering process.
