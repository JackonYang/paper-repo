paperAbstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the
  words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel
  in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal
  of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape
  (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize
  her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying
  shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of
  comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same
  volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape
  the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport,
  using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from
  one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields,
  thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions
  that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being
  increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color
  or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or
  machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short
  book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data
  sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly
  useful for some of these applications.'
