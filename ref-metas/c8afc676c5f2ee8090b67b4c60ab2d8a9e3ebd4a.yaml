paperAbstract: 'Genericity in structured document recognition is a difficult challenge.
  We therefore propose a new generic document recognition method, called DMOS (Description
  and MOdification of Segmentation), that is made up of a new grammatical formalism,
  called EPF (Enhanced Position Formalism) and an associated parser which is able
  to introduce context in segmentation. We implement this method to obtain a generator
  of document recognition systems. This generator can automatically produce new recognition
  systems. It is only necessary to describe the document with an EPF grammar, which
  is then simply compiled. In this way, we have developed various recognition systems:
  one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures.
  We have also defined a specific application to damaged military forms of the 19th
  Century. We have been able to test the generated system on 5,000 of these military
  forms. This has permitted us to validate the DMOS method on a real-world application.'
