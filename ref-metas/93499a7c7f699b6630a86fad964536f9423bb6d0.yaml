paperAbstract: "An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine\
  \ translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during\
  \ translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures\
  \ for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes\
  \ of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source\
  \ words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We\
  \ demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks\
  \ between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve\
  \ a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already\
  \ incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different\
  \ attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT\u2019\
  15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0\
  \ BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.\
