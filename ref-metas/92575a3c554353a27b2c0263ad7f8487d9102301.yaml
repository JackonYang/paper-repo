paperAbstract: The World Wide Web is a vast resource for information. At the same
  time it is extremely distributed. A particular type of data such as restaurant lists
  may be scattered across thousands of independent information sources in many different
  formats. In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting a relation for such
  a data type from all of these sources automatically. We present a technique which
  exploits the duality between sets of patterns and relations to grow the target relation
  starting from a small sample. To test our technique we use it to extract a relation
  of (author,title) pairs from the World Wide Web.
