paperAbstract: Presents a methodology for evaluating graphics recognition systems
  operating on images that contain straight lines, circles, circular arcs, and text
  blocks. It enables an empirical comparison of vectorization software packages and
  uses practical performance evaluation methods that can be applied to complete vectorization
  systems. The methodology includes a set of matching criteria for pairs of graphical
  entities, a set of performance evaluation metrics, and a benchmark for the evaluation
  of graphics recognition systems. The benchmark was tested on three systems. The
  results are reported and analyzed in the paper.
