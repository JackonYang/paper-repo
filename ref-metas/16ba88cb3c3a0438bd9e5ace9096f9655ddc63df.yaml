paperAbstract: In this work, we investigate the visual appearance of real-world surfaces
  and the dependence of appearance on imaging conditions. We present a BRDF (bidirectional
  reflectance distribution function) database with reflectance measurements for over
  60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing
  and source directions. We fit the BRDF measurements to two recent models to obtain
  a BRDF parameter database. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image
  analysis and image synthesis. Finally, we present a BTF (bidirectional texture function)
  database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with
  over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions. Each of these
  unique databases has important implications for a variety of vision algorithms and
  each is made publicly available.
