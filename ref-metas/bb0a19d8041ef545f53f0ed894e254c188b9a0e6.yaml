paperAbstract: In this paper, higher-order correlation clustering (HOCC) is used for
  text line detection in natural images. We treat text line detection as a graph partitioning
  problem, where each vertex is represented by a Maximally Stable Extremal Region
  (MSER). First, weak hypothesises are proposed by coarsely grouping MSERs based on
  their spatial alignment and appearance consistency. Then, higher-order correlation
  clustering (HOCC) is used to partition the MSERs into text line candidates, using
  the hypotheses as soft constraints to enforce long range interactions. We further
  propose a regularization method to solve the Semidefinite Programming problem in
  the inference. Finally we use a simple texton-based texture classifier to filter
  out the non-text areas. This framework allows us to naturally handle multiple orientations,
  languages and fonts. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance
  compared to the state of the art.
