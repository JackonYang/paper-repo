paperAbstract: "We address image classification on a large-scale, i.e. when a large\
  \ number of images and classes are involved. First, we study classification accuracy\
  \ as a function of the image signature dimensionality and the training set size.\
  \ We show experimentally that the larger the training set, the higher the impact\
  \ of the dimensionality on the accuracy. In other words, high-dimensional signatures\
  \ are important to obtain state-of-the-art results on large datasets. Second, we\
  \ tackle the problem of data compression on very large signatures (on the order\
  \ of 105 dimensions) using two lossy compression strategies: a dimensionality reduction\
  \ technique known as the hash kernel and an encoding technique based on product\
  \ quantizers. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in\
  \ accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. We report results on two large databases\
  \ \u2014 ImageNet and a dataset of lM Flickr images \u2014 showing that we can reduce\
  \ the storage of our signatures by a factor 64 to 128 with little loss in accuracy.\
  \ Integrating the decompression in the classifier learning yields an efficient and\
  \ scalable training algorithm. On ILSVRC2010 we report a 74.3% accuracy at top-5,\
  \ which corresponds to a 2.5% absolute improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art.\
  \ On a subset of 10K classes of ImageNet we report a top-1 accuracy of 16.7%, a\
  \ relative improvement of 160% with respect to the state-of-the-art."
