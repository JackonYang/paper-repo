paperAbstract: The problem of obtaining the skeleton of a digitized figure is reduced
  to an optimal policy problem. A hierarchy of methods of defining the skeleton is
  proposed; in the more complicated ones, the skeleton is relatively invariant under
  rotation. Two algorithms for computing the skeleton are defined, and the corresponding
  computer programs are compared. A criterion is proposed for determining the most
  significant skeleton points.
