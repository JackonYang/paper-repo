paperAbstract: This paper discusses the use of the Bayesian network model for a classification
  problem related to the document image understanding field. Our application is focused
  on logical labeling in documents, which consists in assigning logical labels to
  text blocks. The objective is to map a set of logical tags, composing the document
  logical structure, to the physical text components. We build a Bayesian network
  model that allows this mapping using supervised learning, and without imposing a
  priori constraints on the document structure. The learning strategy is based partly
  on genetic programming tools. A prototype has been implemented, and tested on tables
  of contents found in periodicals and magazines.
