paperAbstract: "We present a new approximate inference algorithm for Deep Boltzmann\
  \ Machines (DBM\u2019s), a generative model with many layers of hidden variables.\
  \ The algorithm learns a separate \u201Crecognition\u201D model that is used to\
  \ quickly initialize, in a single bottom-up pass, the values of the latent variables\
  \ in all hidden layers. We show that using such a recognition model, followed by\
  \ a combined top-down and bottom-up pass, it is possible to efficiently learn a\
  \ good generative model of high-dimensional highly-structured sensory input. We\
  \ show that the additional computations required by incorporating a top-down feedback\
  \ plays a critical role in the performance of a DBM, both as a generative and discriminative\
  \ model. Moreover, inference is only at most three times slower compared to the\
  \ approximate inference in a Deep Belief Network (DBN), making large-scale learning\
  \ of DBM\u2019s practical. Finally, we demonstrate that the DBM\u2019s trained using\
  \ the proposed approximate inference algorithm perform well compared to DBN\u2019\
  s and SVM\u2019s on the MNIST handwritten digit, OCR English letters, and NORB visual\
  \ object recognition tasks."
