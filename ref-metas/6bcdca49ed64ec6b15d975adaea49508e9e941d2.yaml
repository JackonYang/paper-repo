paperAbstract: In this paper we describe experiments using eigenfaces for recognition
  and interactive search in the FERET face database. A recognition accuracy of 99.35%
  is obtained using frontal views of 155 individuals. This figure is consistent with
  the 95% recognition rate obtained previously on a much larger database of 7,562
  `mugshots' of approximately 3,000 individuals, consisting of a mix of all age and
  ethnic groups. We also demonstrate that we can automatically determine head pose
  without significantly lowering recognition accuracy; this is accomplished by use
  of a view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique. In addition, a modular eigenspace
  description is used which incorporates salient facial features such as the eyes,
  nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields slightly
  higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition.
  In addition, a robust and automatic feature detection technique using eigentemplates
  is demonstrated.
