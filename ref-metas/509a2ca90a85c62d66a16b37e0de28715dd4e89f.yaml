paperAbstract: Processing language requires the retrieval of concepts from memory
  in response to an ongoing stream of information. This retrieval is facilitated if
  one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist
  to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract
  computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this
  problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic
  representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic
  topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects
  of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory
  tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical
  models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily
  be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure.
