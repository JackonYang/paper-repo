paperAbstract: The problem of learning a concept from examples in a distribution-free
  model is considered. The notion of dynamic sampling, wherein the number of examples
  examined can increase with the complexity of the target concept, is introduced.
  This method is used to establish the learnability of various concept classes with
  an infinite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. An important variation on the problem
  of learning from examples, called approximating from examples, is also discussed.
  The problem of computing the VC dimension of a finite concept set defined on a finite
  domain is considered.<<ETX>>
