paperAbstract: Object models based on bag-of-words representations can achieve state-of-the-art
  performance for image classification and object localization tasks. However, as
  they consider objects as loose collections of local patches they fail to accurately
  locate object boundaries and are not able to produce accurate object segmentation.
  On the other hand, Markov random field models used for image segmentation focus
  on object boundaries but can hardly use the global constraints necessary to deal
  with object categories whose appearance may vary significantly. In this paper we
  combine the advantages of both approaches. First, a mechanism based on local regions
  allows object detection using visual word occurrences and produces a rough image
  segmentation. Then, a MRF component gives clean boundaries and enforces label consistency,
  guided by local image cues (color, texture and edge cues) and by long-distance dependencies.
  Gibbs sampling is used to infer the model. The proposed method successfully segments
  object categories with highly varying appearances in the presence of cluttered backgrounds
  and large view point changes. We show that it outperforms published results on the
  Pascal VOC 2007 dataset.
