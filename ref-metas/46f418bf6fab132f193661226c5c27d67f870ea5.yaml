paperAbstract: This paper presents a scalable method for integrating compositional
  morphological representations into a vector-based probabilistic language model.
  Our approach is evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered
  suitably efficient for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring
  the vocabulary. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, presenting
  results on a range of languages which demonstrate that our model learns morphological
  representations that both perform well on word similarity tasks and lead to substantial
  reductions in perplexity. When used for translation into morphologically rich languages
  with large vocabularies, our models obtain improvements of up to 1.2 BLEU points
  relative to a baseline system using back-off n-gram models.
