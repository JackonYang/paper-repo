paperAbstract: A computational model is presented for the visual recognition of three-dimensional
  objects based upon their spatial correspondence with two-dimensional features in
  an image. A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and
  implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process
  has been developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters
  from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional
  image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the
  correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given
  a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components
  of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered.
  Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not assume that it
  is possible to directly derive depth information from the image. Instead, the primary
  descriptive component is a process of perceptual organization, in which spatial
  relations are detected directly among two-dimensional image features. A basic requirement
  of the recognition process is that perceptual organization should accurately distinguish
  meaningful groupings from those which arise by accident of viewpoint or position.
  This requirement is used to derive a number of further constraints which must be
  satisfied by algorithms for perceptual grouping. A specific algorithm is presented
  for the problem of segmenting curves into natural descriptions. Methods are also
  presented for using the viewpoint-invariance properties of the perceptual groupings
  to infer three-dimensional relations directly from the image. The search process
  itself is described, both for covering the range of possible viewpoints and the
  range of possible objects. A method is presented for using evidential reasoning
  to combine information from multiple sources to determine the most efficient ordering
  for the search. This use of evidential reasoning allows a system to automatically
  improve its performance as it gains visual experience. In summary, spatial organization
  and recognition are shown to be a practical basis for current systems and to provide
  a promising path for further development of improved visual capabilities.
