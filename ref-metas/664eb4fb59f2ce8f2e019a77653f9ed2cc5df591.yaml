paperAbstract: Parameter estimation for multivariate functions of Markov chains, a
  class of versatile statistical models for vector random processes, is discussed.
  The model regards an ordered sequence of vectors as noisy multivariate observations
  of a Markov chain. Mixture distributions are a special case. The foundations of
  the theory presented here were established by Baum, Petrie, Soules, and Weiss. A
  powerful representation theorem by Fan is employed to generalize the analysis of
  Baum, {\em et al.} to a larger class of distributions.
