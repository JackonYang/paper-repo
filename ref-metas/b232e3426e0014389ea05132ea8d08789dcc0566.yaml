paperAbstract: "A stereo algorithm is presented that optimizes a maximum likelihood\
  \ cost function. The maximum likelihood cost function assumes that corresponding\
  \ features in the left and right images are normally distributed about a common\
  \ true value and consists of a weighted squared error term if two features are matched\
  \ or a (fixed) cost if a feature is determined to be occluded. The stereo algorithm\
  \ finds the set of correspondences that maximize the cost function subject to ordering\
  \ and uniqueness constraints. The stereo algorithm is independent of the matching\
  \ primitives. However, for the experiments described in this paper, matching is\
  \ performed on the $cf4$individual pixel intensities.$cf3$ Contrary to popular belief,\
  \ the pixel-based stereo appears to be robust for a variety of images. It also has\
  \ the advantages of (i) providing adensedisparity map, (ii) requiringnofeature extraction,\
  \ and (iii)avoidingthe adaptive windowing problem of area-based correlation methods.\
  \ Because feature extraction and windowing are unnecessary, a very fast implementation\
  \ is possible. Experimental results reveal that good stereo correspondences can\
  \ be found using only ordering and uniqueness constraints, i.e., withoutlocalsmoothness\
  \ constraints. However, it is shown that the original maximum likelihood stereo\
  \ algorithm exhibits multiple global minima. The dynamic programming algorithm is\
  \ guaranteed to find one, but not necessarily the same one for each epipolar scanline,\
  \ causing erroneous correspondences which are visible as small local differences\
  \ between neighboring scanlines. Traditionally, regularization, which modifies the\
  \ original cost function, has been applied to the problem of multiple global minima.\
  \ We developed several variants of the algorithm that avoid classical regularization\
  \ while imposing several global cohesiveness constraints. We believe this is a novel\
  \ approach that has the advantage of guaranteeing that solutions minimize the original\
  \ cost function and preserve discontinuities. The constraints are based on minimizing\
  \ the total number of horizontal and/or vertical discontinuities along and/or between\
  \ adjacent epipolar lines, and local smoothing is avoided. Experiments reveal that\
  \ minimizing the sum of the horizontal and vertical discontinuities provides the\
  \ most accurate results. A high percentage of correct matches and very little smearing\
  \ of depth discontinuities are obtained. An alternative to imposing cohesiveness\
  \ constraints to reduce the correspondence ambiguities is to use more than two cameras.\
  \ We therefore extend the two camera maximum likelihood toNcameras. TheN-camera\
  \ stereo algorithm determines the \u201Cbest\u201D set of correspondences between\
  \ a given pair of cameras, referred to as the principal cameras. Knowledge of the\
  \ relative positions of the cameras allows the 3D point hypothesized by an assumed\
  \ correspondence of two features in the principal pair to be projected onto the\
  \ image plane of the remainingN? 2 cameras. TheseN? 2 points are then used to verify\
  \ proposed matches. Not only does the algorithm explicitly model occlusion between\
  \ features of the principal pair, but the possibility of occlusions in theN? 2 additional\
  \ views is also modeled. Previous work did not model this occlusion process, the\
  \ benefits and importance of which are experimentally verified. Like other multiframe\
  \ stereo algorithms, the computational and memory costs of this approach increase\
  \ linearly with each additional view. Experimental results are shown for two outdoor\
  \ scenes. It is clearly demonstrated that the number of correspondence errors is\
  \ significantly reduced as the number of views/cameras is increased."
