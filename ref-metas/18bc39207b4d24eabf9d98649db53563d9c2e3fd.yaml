paperAbstract: This paper outlines a technique for treating input texture images as
  probability density estimators from which new textures, with similar appearance
  and structural properties, can be sampled. In a two-phase process, the input texture
  is first analyzed by measuring the joint occurrence of texture discrimination features
  at multiple resolutions. In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling
  successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar
  joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized
  with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures
  than do previous techniques.
