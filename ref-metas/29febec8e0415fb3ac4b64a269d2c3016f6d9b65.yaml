paperAbstract: "For text, audio, video, and still images, a number of projects have\
  \ addressed the problem of estimating inter-object similarity and the related problem\
  \ of finding transition, or \u2018segmentation\u2019 points in a stream of objects\
  \ of the same media type. There has been relatively little work in this area for\
  \ document images, which are typically text-intensive and contain a mixture of layout,\
  \ text-based, and image features. Beyond simple partitioning, the problem of clustering\
  \ related page images is also important, especially for information retrieval problems\
  \ such as document image searching and browsing. Motivated by this, we describe\
  \ a model for estimating inter-page similarity in ordered collections of document\
  \ images, based on a combination of text and layout features. The features are used\
  \ as input to a discriminative classifier, whose output is used in a constrained\
  \ clustering criterion. We do a task-based evaluation of our method by applying\
  \ it the problem of automatic document separation during batch scanning. Using layout\
  \ and page numbering features, our algorithm achieved a separation accuracy of 95.6%\
  \ on the test collection."
