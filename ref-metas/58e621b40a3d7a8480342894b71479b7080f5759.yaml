paperAbstract: 'This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer
  vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing
  of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects:
  The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space
  concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical
  way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel
  called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving
  a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and
  two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels
  is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties
  of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation,
  called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical
  relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making
  information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its
  construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant
  image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation
  in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative
  information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding
  and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection,
  histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible
  applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching,
  model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties
  of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates
  under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events
  at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a
  signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional
  signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle
  point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations,
  merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate
  that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results.'
