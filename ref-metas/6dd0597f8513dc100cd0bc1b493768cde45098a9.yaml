paperAbstract: We consider the machine vision task of pose estimation from static
  images, specifically for the case of articulated objects. This problem is hard because
  of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established
  line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model.
  In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power
  of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference
  as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better
  features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose
  estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive
  with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it
  does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of
  horses in the Weizmann database.
