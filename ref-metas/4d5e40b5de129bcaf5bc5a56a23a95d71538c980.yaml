paperAbstract: Detecting text regions in natural scenes is an important part of computer
  vision. We propose a novel text detection algorithm that extracts six different
  classes features of text, and uses Modest AdaBoost with multi-scale sequential search.
  Experiments show that our algorithm can detect text regions with a f= 0.70, from
  the ICDAR 2003 datasets which include images with text of various fonts, sizes,
  colors, alphabets and scripts.
