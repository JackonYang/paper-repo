paperAbstract: 'This paper presents geometric algorithms for solving two key problems
  in layout analysis: finding a cover of the background whitespace of a document in
  terms of maximal empty rectangles, and finding constrained maximum likelihood matches
  of geometric text line models in the presence of geometric obstacles. The algorithms
  are considerably easier to implement than prior methods, they return globally optimal
  solutions, and they require no heuristics. The paper also introduces an evaluation
  function that reliably identifies maximal empty rectangles corresponding to column
  boundaries. Combining this evaluation function with the two geometric algorithms
  results in an easy-to-implement layout analysis system. Reliability of the system
  is demonstrated on documents from the UW3 database.'
