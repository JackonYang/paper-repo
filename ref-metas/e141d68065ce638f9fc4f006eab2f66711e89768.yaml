paperAbstract: Learning structure in temporally-extended sequences is a difficult
  computational problem because only a fraction of the relevant information is available
  at any instant. Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to
  find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover
  arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving
  high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music
  composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical
  structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical
  phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations
  among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced
  description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily
  detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different
  time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units
  are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by
  standard back propagation.
