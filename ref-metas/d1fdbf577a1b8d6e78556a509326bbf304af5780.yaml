paperAbstract: "Document organization may be described in different ways. The physical\
  \ presentation on one hand by means of a nested layout structure representing a\
  \ \u201Cpart-of\u201D-relationship, e.g. of text blocks, text line segments, words,\
  \ and characters. The composition of meaningful entities, such as title, author,\
  \ address, or abstract, on the other, in terms of a logical structure. Both views\
  \ to the contents of a document are complementary. They relate to each other as\
  \ being explicitely given by publication guidelines where the position and dimensions\
  \ of logical objects are precisely described. Moreover such \u201Cpublication guidelines\u201D\
  \ more or less hold for various types of documents. Although they are intuitively\
  \ understandable for human beings, they are hard to formalize explicitly because\
  \ of the freedom originators and authors of documents have in order to incorporate\
  \ their own creativity. However, humans use these intrinsic layout features to get\
  \ first hints towards the logical meaning of document information. This is even\
  \ obvious when considering the very difficult document examples in Figure 1 where\
  \ no text is given but it is nevertheless possible to generate hypothesis for logical\
  \ meaning."
