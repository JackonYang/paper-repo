paperAbstract: The algorithm described in this paper is designed to detect potential
  table regions in the document, to decide whether a potential table region is, in
  fact, a table, and, when it is, to analyze the table structure. The decision and
  analysis phases of the algorithm and the resulting system are based primarily on
  a precise definition of table, and it is such a definition that is discussed in
  this paper. An adequate definition need not be complete in the sense of encompassing
  all possible structures that might be deemed to be tables, but it should encompass
  most such structures, it should include essential features of tables, and it should
  exclude features never or very rarely possessed by tables.
