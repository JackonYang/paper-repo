paperAbstract: As part of the development of a document image analysis system, a method,
  based on the Hough transform, was devised for the detection of document skew and
  interline spacing-necessary parameters for the automatic segmentation of text from
  graphics. Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of
  data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal
  and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine
  whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst
  image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines
  by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst
  image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform
  can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images.
  Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator
  array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor
  of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently,
  interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>
