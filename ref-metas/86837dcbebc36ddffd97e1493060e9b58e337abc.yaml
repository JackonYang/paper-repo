paperAbstract: "The problem of searching the set of keys in a file to find a key which\
  \ is closest to a given query key is discussed. After \u201Cclosest,\u201D in terms\
  \ of a metric on the the key space, is suitably defined, three file structures are\
  \ presented together with their corresponding search algorithms, which are intended\
  \ to reduce the number of comparisons required to achieve the desired result. These\
  \ methods are derived using certain inequalities satisfied by metrics and by graph-theoretic\
  \ concepts. Some empirical results are presented which compare the efficiency of\
  \ the methods."
