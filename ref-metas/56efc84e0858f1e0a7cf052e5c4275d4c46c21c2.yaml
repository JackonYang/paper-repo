paperAbstract: 'We describe a method of recognizing handwritten digits by fitting
  generative models that are built from deformable B-splines with Gaussian "ink generators"
  spaced along the length of the spline. The splines are adjusted using a novel elastic
  matching procedure based on the expectation maximization algorithm that maximizes
  the likelihood of the model generating the data. This approach has many advantages:
  1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description
  of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing
  style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation; 3)
  the method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is
  relatively easy and fast; and 4) unlike many other recognition schemes, it does
  not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary
  scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. We have demonstrated
  that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima.
  The main disadvantage of the method is that it requires much more computation than
  more standard OCR techniques.'
