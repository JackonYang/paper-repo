paperAbstract: We present a new AI task - Embodied Question Answering (EmbodiedQA)
  - where an agent is spawned at a random location in a 3D environment and asked a
  question ('What color is the car?'). In order to answer, the agent must first intelligently
  navigate to explore the environment, gather necessary visual information through
  first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question ('orange'). EmbodiedQA
  requires a range of AI skills - language understanding, visual recognition, active
  perception, goal-driven navigation, commonsense reasoning, long-term memory, and
  grounding language into actions. In this work, we develop a dataset of questions
  and answers in House3D environments [1], evaluation metrics, and a hierarchical
  model trained with imitation and reinforcement learning.
