paperAbstract: Machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch simplify
  model implementation. However, researchers are still required to perform a non-trivial
  amount of manual tasks such as GPU allocation, training status tracking, and comparison
  of models with different hyperparameter settings. We propose a system to handle
  these tasks and help researchers focus on models. We present the requirements of
  the system based on a collection of discussions from an online study group comprising
  25k members. These include automatic GPU allocation, learning status visualization,
  handling model parameter snapshots as well as hyperparameter modification during
  learning, and comparison of performance metrics between models via a leaderboard.
  We describe the system architecture that fulfills these requirements and present
  a proof-of-concept implementation, NAVER Smart Machine Learning (NSML). We test
  the system and confirm substantial efficiency improvements for model development.
