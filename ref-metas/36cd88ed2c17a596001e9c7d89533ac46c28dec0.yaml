paperAbstract: "In this paper we describe a trainable object detector and its instantiations\
  \ for detecting faces and cars at any size, location, and pose. To cope with variation\
  \ in object orientation, the detector uses multiple classifiers, each spanning a\
  \ different range of orientation. Each of these classifiers determines whether the\
  \ object is present at a specified size within a fixed-size image window. To find\
  \ the object at any location and size, these classifiers scan the image exhaustively.Each\
  \ classifier is based on the statistics of localized parts. Each part is a transform\
  \ from a subset of wavelet coefficients to a discrete set of values. Such parts\
  \ are designed to capture various combinations of locality in space, frequency,\
  \ and orientation. In building each classifier, we gathered the class-conditional\
  \ statistics of these part values from representative samples of object and non-object\
  \ images. We trained each classifier to minimize classification error on the training\
  \ set by using Adaboost with Confidence-Weighted Predictions (Shapire and Singer,\
  \ 1999). In detection, each classifier computes the part values within the image\
  \ window and looks up their associated class-conditional probabilities. The classifier\
  \ then makes a decision by applying a likelihood ratio test. For efficiency, the\
  \ classifier evaluates this likelihood ratio in stages. At each stage, the classifier\
  \ compares the partial likelihood ratio to a threshold and makes a decision about\
  \ whether to cease evaluation\u2014labeling the input as non-object\u2014or to continue\
  \ further evaluation. The detector orders these stages of evaluation from a low-resolution\
  \ to a high-resolution search of the image. Our trainable object detector achieves\
  \ reliable and efficient detection of human faces and passenger cars with out-of-plane\
  \ rotation."
