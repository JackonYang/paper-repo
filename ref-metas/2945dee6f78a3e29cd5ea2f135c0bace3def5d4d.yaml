paperAbstract: We present a new feature representation method for scene text recognition
  problem, particularly focusing on improving scene character recognition. Many existing
  methods rely on Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) or part-based models, which
  do not span the feature space well for characters in natural scene images, especially
  given large variation in fonts with cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose
  a discriminative feature pooling method that automatically learns the most informative
  sub-regions of each scene character within a multi-class classification framework,
  whereas each sub-region seamlessly integrates a set of low-level image features
  through integral images. The proposed feature representation is compact, computationally
  efficient, and able to effectively model distinctive spatial structures of each
  individual character class. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets
  (Chars74K, ICDAR'03, ICDAR'11, SVT) show that our method significantly outperforms
  existing methods on scene character classification and scene text recognition tasks.
