paperAbstract: An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class
  of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation,
  and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection.
  These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex
  that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently
  detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale
  space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing
  blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The
  keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate
  object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual
  least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show
  that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images
  with a computation time of under 2 seconds.
