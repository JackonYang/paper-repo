paperAbstract: 'As the rapid growth of PDF documents, recognizing the document structure
  and components are useful for document storage, classification and retrieval. Table,
  a ubiquitous document component, becomes an important information source. Accurately
  detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for many applications, e.g., the
  increasing demand on the table data search. Rather than converting PDFs to image
  or HTML and then processing with other techniques (e.g., OCR), extracting and analyzing
  texts from PDFs directly is easy and accurate. However, text extraction tools face
  a common problem: text sequence error. In this paper, we propose two algorithms
  to recover the sequence of extracted sparse lines, which improve the table content
  collection. The experimental results show the comparison of the performance of both
  algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of text sequence recovering for the
  table boundary detection.'
