paperAbstract: Parsing textual information embedded in images is important for various
  downstream tasks. However, many previously developed parsers are limited to handling
  the information presented in one dimensional sequence format. Here, we present POST
  OCR TAGGING BASED PARSER (POT), a simple and robust parser that can parse visually
  embedded texts by BIO-tagging the output of optical character recognition (OCR)
  task. Our shallow parsing approach enables building robust neural parser with less
  than a thousand labeled data. POT is validated on receipt and namecard parsing tasks.
