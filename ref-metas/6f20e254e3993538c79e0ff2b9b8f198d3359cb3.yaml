paperAbstract: In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate
  cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several
  distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at
  one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses
  at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the
  part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the
  light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric
  receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The
  'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic,
  and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering
  the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving
  lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied
  gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual
  field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk
  responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses
  than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one
  direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations,
  includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive
  fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory
  and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell
  receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory
  areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion
  cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli
