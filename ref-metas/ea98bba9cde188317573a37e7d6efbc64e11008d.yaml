paperAbstract: "Abstract.Although the Internet is increasingly emerging as \u201C\
  the\u201D widespread platform for information interchange, day-to-day work in companies\
  \ still necessitates the laborious, manual processing of huge amounts of printed\
  \ documents. This article presents the system smartFIX, a document analysis and\
  \ understanding system developed by the DFKI spin-off insiders technologies. It\
  \ enables the automatic processing of documents ranging from fixed format forms\
  \ to unstructured letters of any format. In addition to the architecture, main components,\
  \ and system characteristics, we also show some results from the application of\
  \ smartFIX to medical bills and prescriptions."
