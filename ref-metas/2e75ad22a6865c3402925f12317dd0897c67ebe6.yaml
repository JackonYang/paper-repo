paperAbstract: 'Machine learning develops intelligent computer systems that are able
  to generalize from previously seen examples. A new domain of machine learning, in
  which the prediction must satisfy the additional constraints found in structured
  data, poses one of machine learning''s greatest challenges: learning functional
  dependencies between arbitrary input and output domains. This volume presents and
  analyzes the state of the art in machine learning algorithms and theory in this
  novel field. The contributors discuss applications as diverse as machine translation,
  document markup, computational biology, and information extraction, among others,
  providing a timely overview of an exciting field. Contributors Yasemin Altun, Gokhan
