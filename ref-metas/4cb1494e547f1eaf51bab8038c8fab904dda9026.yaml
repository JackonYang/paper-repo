paperAbstract: "Datasets for training object recognition systems are steadily growing\
  \ in size. This paper investigates the question of whether existing detectors will\
  \ continue to improve as data grows, or if models are close to saturating due to\
  \ limited model complexity and the Bayes risk associated with the feature spaces\
  \ in which they operate. We focus on the popular paradigm of scanning-window templates\
  \ defined on oriented gradient features, trained with discriminative classifiers.\
  \ We investigate the performance of mixtures of templates as a function of the number\
  \ of templates (complexity) and the amount of training data. We find that additional\
  \ data does help, but only with correct regularization and treatment of noisy examples\
  \ or \u201Coutliers\u201D in the training data. Surprisingly, the performance of\
  \ problem domain-agnostic mixture models appears to saturate quickly (\u223C10 templates\
  \ and \u223C100 positive training examples per template). However, compositional\
  \ mixtures (implemented via composed parts) give much better performance because\
  \ they share parameters among templates, and can synthesize new templates not encountered\
  \ during training. This suggests there is still room to improve performance with\
  \ linear classifiers and the existing feature space by improved representations\
  \ and learning algorithms."
