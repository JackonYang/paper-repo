paperAbstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) can reduce the need for costly annotation
  in tasks such as semantic segmentation by weakening the required degree of supervision.
  We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning
  by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation
  model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly
  optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment.
  Fully convolutional training accepts inputs of any size, does not need object proposal
  pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances.
  Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple
  labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL
  VOC segmentation challenge.
