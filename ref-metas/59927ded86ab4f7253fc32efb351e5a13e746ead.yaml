paperAbstract: 'We present a new tree based approach to composing expressive image
  descriptions that makes use of naturally occuring web images with captions. We investigate
  two related tasks: image caption generalization and generation, where the former
  is an optional subtask of the latter. The high-level idea of our approach is to
  harvest expressive phrases (as tree fragments) from existing image descriptions,
  then to compose a new description by selectively combining the extracted (and optionally
  pruned) tree fragments. Key algorithmic components are tree composition and compression,
  both integrating tree structure with sequence structure. Our proposed system attains
  significantly better performance than previous approaches for both image caption
  generalization and generation. In addition, our work is the first to show the empirical
  benefit of automatically generalized captions for composing natural image descriptions.'
