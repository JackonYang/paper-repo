paperAbstract: We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of placing objects,
  described by high-dimensional vectors or by pairwise dissimilarities, in a low-dimensional
  space in a way that preserves neighbor identities. A Gaussian is centered on each
  object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the
  given dissimilarities) are used to define a probability distribution over all the
  potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this
  distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional
  "images" of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences,
  one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of
  the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this
  probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely
  separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document
  count vector for the word "bank", to have versions close to the images of both "river"
  and "finance" without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close
  to those of corporate concepts.
