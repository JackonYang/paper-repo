paperAbstract: DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from
  Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you
  to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link
  other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia
  datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human-andmachine-consumption.
  We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website
  authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the
  current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline
  how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data.
