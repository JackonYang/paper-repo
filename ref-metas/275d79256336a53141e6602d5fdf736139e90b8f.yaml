paperAbstract: We are concerned with the extraction of tables from exchange format
  representations of very diverse composite documents. We put forward a flexible representation
  scheme for complex tables, based on a clear distinction between the physical layout
  of a table and its logical structure. Relying on this scheme, we develop a new method
  for the detection and the extraction of tables by an analysis of the graphic lines.
  To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on
  the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on
  a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph
  representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited.
