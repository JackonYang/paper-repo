paperAbstract: Rotationally symmetric operations in the image domain may give rise
  to shape distortions. This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a
  general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which
  are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns.
  By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation
  and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface
  orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by
  typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors,
  on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations,
  and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized
  perspective mapping.
