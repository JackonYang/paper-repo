paperAbstract: Markov networks are extensively used to model complex sequential, spatial,
  and relational interactions in fields as diverse as image processing, natural language
  analysis, and bioinformatics. However, inference and learning in general Markov
  networks is intractable. In this paper, we focus on learning a large subclass of
  such models (called associative Markov networks) that are tractable or closely approximable.
  This subclass contains networks of discrete variables with K labels each and clique
  potentials that favor the same labels for all variables in the clique. Such networks
  capture the "guilt by association" pattern of reasoning present in many domains,
  in which connected ("associated") variables tend to have the same label. Our approach
  exploits a linear programming relaxation for the task of finding the best joint
  assignment in such networks, which provides an approximate quadratic program (QP)
  for the problem of learning a margin-maximizing Markov network. We show that for
  associative Markov network over binary-valued variables, this approximate QP is
  guaranteed to return an optimal parameterization for Markov networks of arbitrary
  topology. For the nonbinary case, optimality is not guaranteed, but the relaxation
  produces good solutions in practice. Experimental results with hypertext and newswire
  classification show significant advantages over standard approaches.
