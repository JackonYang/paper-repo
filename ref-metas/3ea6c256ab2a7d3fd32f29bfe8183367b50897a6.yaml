paperAbstract: "The web contains countless semi-structured websites, which can be\
  \ a rich source of information for populating knowledge bases. Existing methods\
  \ for extracting relations from the DOM trees of semi-structured webpages can achieve\
  \ high precision and recall only when manual annotations for each website are available.\
  \ Although there have been efforts to learn extractors from automatically-generated\
  \ labels, these methods are not sufficiently robust to succeed in settings with\
  \ complex schemas and information-rich websites. \nIn this paper we present a new\
  \ method for automatic extraction from semi-structured websites based on distant\
  \ supervision. We automatically generate training labels by aligning an existing\
  \ knowledge base with a web page and leveraging the unique structural characteristics\
  \ of semi-structured websites. We then train a classifier based on the potentially\
  \ noisy and incomplete labels to predict new relation instances. Our method can\
  \ compete with annotation-based techniques in the literature in terms of extraction\
  \ quality. A large-scale experiment on over 400,000 pages from dozens of multi-lingual\
  \ long-tail websites harvested 1.25 million facts at a precision of 90%."
