paperAbstract: In the traditional object recognition pipeline, descriptors are densely
  sampled over an image, pooled into a high dimensional non-linear representation
  and then passed to a classifier. In recent years, Fisher Vectors have proven empirically
  to be the leading representation for a large variety of applications. The Fisher
  Vector is typically taken as the gradients of the log-likelihood of descriptors,
  with respect to the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Motivated by the
  assumption that different distributions should be applied for different datasets,
  we present two other Mixture Models and derive their Expectation-Maximization and
  Fisher Vector expressions. The first is a Laplacian Mixture Model (LMM), which is
  based on the Laplacian distribution. The second Mixture Model presented is a Hybrid
  Gaussian-Laplacian Mixture Model (HGLMM) which is based on a weighted geometric
  mean of the Gaussian and Laplacian distribution. An interesting property of the
  Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the latter is that in the maximization step,
  each dimension in each component is chosen to be either a Gaussian or a Laplacian.
  Finally, by using the new Fisher Vectors derived from HGLMMs, we achieve state-of-the-art
  results for both the image annotation and the image search by a sentence tasks.
