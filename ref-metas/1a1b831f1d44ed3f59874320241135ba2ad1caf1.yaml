paperAbstract: In the research of statistical approach for handwritten character recognition,
  directional element feature (DEF) and modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF)
  have been extremely successful and widely used in practical applications. In this
  paper, we apply several state-of-the-art techniques of handwritten character recognition
  on this baseline system to improve the recognition accuracy. In feature extraction
  stage, gradient feature is extracted to replace DEF, which provides higher resolution
  on both magnitude and angle of the directional strokes in character image. In classification
  stage, the performance of MQDF classifier is enhanced by multiple discrimination
  schemes, including minimum classification error (MCE) training on the classifier
  parameters and modified distance representation for similar characters discrimination.
  All these techniques we use lead to improvement on the character recognition rate.
  The performance of the improved recognition system has been evaluated by both handwritten
  digit recognition and handwritten Chinese character recognition experiments, in
  which very promising results are achieved.
