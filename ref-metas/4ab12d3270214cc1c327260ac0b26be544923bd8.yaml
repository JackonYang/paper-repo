paperAbstract: This paper addresses human pose recognition from video sequences by
  formulating it as a classification problem. Unlike much previous work we do not
  make any assumptions on the availability of clean segmentation. The first step of
  this work consists in a novel method of aligning the training images using 3D Mocap
  data. Next we define classes by discretizing a 2D manifold whose two dimensions
  are camera viewpoint and actions. Our main contribution is a pose detection algorithm
  based on random forests. A bottom-up approach is followed to build a decision tree
  by recursively clustering and merging the classes at each level. For each node of
  the decision tree we build a list of potentially discriminative features using the
  alignment of training images; in this paper we consider Histograms of Orientated
  Gradient (HOG). We finally grow an ensemble of trees by randomly sampling one of
  the selected HOG blocks at each node. Our proposed approach gives promising results
  with both fixed and moving cameras.
