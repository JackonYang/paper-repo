paperAbstract: recognition. Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture
  description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's
  chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition,
  who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory
  is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and
  notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular,
  context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations,
  and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional
  grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive
  description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars
  are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy
  to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures,
  presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory.
  The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are
  presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free
  grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted
  grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and
  push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree
  recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic
  pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages,
  and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978).
  As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing
  has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in
  pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and
  exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar
  from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical
  and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand
  the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's
  opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came
  out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern
  recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows.
