paperAbstract: We present a system for interactively browsing and exploring large
  unstructured collections of photographs of a scene using a novel 3D interface. Our
  system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes
  the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image
  to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques
  to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation
  and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information
  such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of
  scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically
  transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large
  personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing
  sites.
