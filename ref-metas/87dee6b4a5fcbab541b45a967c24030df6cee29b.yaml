paperAbstract: Automatic information extraction from scanned business documents is
  especially valuable in the application domain of document archiving. But current
  systems for automated document processing still require a lot of configuration work
  that can only be done by experienced users or administrators. We present an approach
  for information extraction which purely builds on end-user provided training examples
  and intentionally omits efficient known extraction techniques like rule based extraction
  that require intense training and/or information extraction expertise. Our evaluation
  on a large corpus of business documents shows competitive results of above 85% F1-measure
  on 10 commonly used fields like document type, sender, receiver and date. The system
  is deployed and used inside the commercial document management system DocuWare.
