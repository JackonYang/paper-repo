paperAbstract: Models for many natural language tasks benefit from the flexibility
  to use overlapping, non-independent features. For example, the need for labeled
  data can be drastically reduced by taking advantage of domain knowledge in the form
  of word lists, part-of-speech tags, character n-grams, and capitalization patterns.
  While it is difficult to capture such inter-dependent features with a generative
  probabilistic model, conditionally-trained models, such as conditional maximum entropy
  models, handle them well. There has been significant work with such models for greedy
  sequence modeling in NLP (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Borthwick et al., 1998).
