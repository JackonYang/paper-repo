paperAbstract: 'The problem of detection of orientation in finite dimensional Euclidean
  spaces is solved in the least squares sense. The theory is developed for the case
  when such orientation computations are necessary at all local neighborhoods of the
  n-dimensional Euclidean space. Detection of orientation is shown to correspond to
  fitting an axis or a plane to the Fourier transform of an n-dimensional structure.
  The solution of this problem is related to the solution of a well-known matrix eigenvalue
  problem. The computations can be performed in the spatial domain without actually
  doing a Fourier transformation. Along with the orientation estimate, a certainty
  measure, based on the error of the fit, is proposed. Two applications in image analysis
  are considered: texture segmentation and optical flow. The theory is verified by
  experiments which confirm accurate orientation estimates and reliable certainty
  measures in the presence of noise. The comparative results indicate that the theory
  produces algorithms computing robust texture features as well as optical flow. >'
