paperAbstract: Abstract The cerebral cortex is a rich and diverse structure that is
  the basis of intelligent behavior. One of the deepest mysteries of the function
  of cortex is that neural processing times are only about one hundred times as fast
  as the fastest response times for complex behavior. At the very least, this would
  seem to indicate that the cortex does massive amounts of parallel computation. This
  paper explores the hypothesis that an important part of the cortex can be modeled
  as a connectionist computer that is especially suited for parallel problem solving.
  The connectionist computer uses a special representation, termed value unit encoding,
  that represents small subsets of parameters in a way that allows parallel access
  to many different parameter values. This computer can be thought of as computing
  hierarchies of sensorimotor invariants. The neural substrate can be interpreted
  as a commitment to data structures and algorithms that compute invariants fast enough
  to explain the behavioral response times. A detailed consideration of this model
  has several implications for the underlying anatomy and physiology.
