paperAbstract: 'We present a natural language interface system which is based entirely
  on trained statistical models. The system consists of three stages of processing:
  parsing, semantic interpretation, and discourse. Each of these stages is modeled
  as a statistical process. The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end
  system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.'
