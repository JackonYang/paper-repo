paperAbstract: We have developed algorithms for automatic character segmentation in
  motion pictures which extract automatically and reliably the text in pre-title sequences,
  credit titles, and closing sequences with title and credits. The algorithms we propose
  make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enhance segmentation
  and, consequently, recognition performance. As a result, we get segmented characters
  from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results
  of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined
  to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our
  segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from
  television and achieved good segmentation results.
