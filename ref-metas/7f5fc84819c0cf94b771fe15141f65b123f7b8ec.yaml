paperAbstract: State-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations
  of convolutional networks that had originally been designed for image classification.
  However, dense prediction and image classification are structurally different. In
  this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed
  for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically
  aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture
  is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of
  the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented
  context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
  systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks
  to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.
