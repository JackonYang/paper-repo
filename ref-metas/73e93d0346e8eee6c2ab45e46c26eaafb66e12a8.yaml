paperAbstract: 'We describe a neurally-inspired, unsupervised learning algorithm that
  builds a non-linear generative model for pairs of face images from the same individual.
  Individuals are then recognized by finding the highest relative probability pair
  among all pairs that consist of a test image and an image whose identity is known.
  Our method compares favorably with other methods in the literature. The generative
  model consists of a single layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors and
  it has the property that, given a data vector, the true posterior probability distribution
  over the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or
  approximation. The weights of the feature detectors are learned by comparing the
  correlations of pixel intensities and feature activations in two phases: When the
  network is observing real data and when it is observing reconstructions of real
  data generated from the feature activations.'
