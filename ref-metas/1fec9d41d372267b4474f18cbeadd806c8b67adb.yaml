paperAbstract: Non-textual components such as charts, diagrams and tables provide
  key information in many scientific documents, but the lack of large labeled datasets
  has impeded the development of data-driven methods for scientific figure extraction.
  In this paper, we induce high-quality training labels for the task of figure extraction
  in a large number of scientific documents, with no human intervention. To accomplish
  this we leverage the auxiliary data provided in two large web collections of scientific
  documents (arXiv and PubMed) to locate figures and their associated captions in
  the rasterized PDF. We share the resulting dataset of over 5.5 million induced labels---4,000
  times larger than the previous largest figure extraction dataset---with an average
  precision of 96.8%, to enable the development of modern data-driven methods for
  this task. We use this dataset to train a deep neural network for end-to-end figure
  detection, yielding a model that can be more easily extended to new domains compared
  to previous work. The model was successfully deployed in Semantic Scholar,\footnote\urlhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/
  a large-scale academic search engine, and used to extract figures in 13 million
  scientific documents.\footnoteA demo of our system is available at \urlhttp://labs.semanticscholar.org/deepfigures/,and
  our dataset of induced labels can be downloaded at \urlhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-research-public/deepfigures/jcdl-deepfigures-labels.tar.gz.
  Code to run our system locally can be found at \urlhttps://github.com/allenai/deepfigures-open.
