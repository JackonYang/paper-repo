paperAbstract: This paper presents an approach to text recognition in natural scene
  images. Unlike most existing works which assume that texts are horizontal and frontal
  parallel to the image plane, our method is able to recognize perspective texts of
  arbitrary orientations. For individual character recognition, we adopt a bag-of-key
  points approach, in which Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors are
  extracted densely and quantized using a pre-trained vocabulary. Following [1, 2],
  the context information is utilized through lexicons. We formulate word recognition
  as finding the optimal alignment between the set of characters and the list of lexicon
  words. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset called StreetViewText-Perspective,
  which contains texts in street images with a great variety of viewpoints. Experimental
  results on public datasets and the proposed dataset show that our method significantly
  outperforms the state-of-the-art on perspective texts of arbitrary orientations.
