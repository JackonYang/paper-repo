paperAbstract: We consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled
  data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference.
  A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function
  which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively
  revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to
  obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results
  on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled
  data.
