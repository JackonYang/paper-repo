paperAbstract: THE standard form of back-propagation learning1 is implausible as a
  model of perceptual learning because it requires an external teacher to specify
  the desired output of the network. We show how the external teacher can be replaced
  by internally derived teaching signals. These signals are generated by using the
  assumption that different parts of the perceptual input have common causes in the
  external world. Small modules that look at separate but related parts of the perceptual
  input discover these common causes by striving to produce outputs that agree with
  each other (Fig. la). The modules may look at different modalities (such as vision
  and touch), or the same modality at different times (for example, the consecutive
  two-dimensional views of a rotating three-dimensional object), or even spatially
  adjacent parts of the same image. Our simulations show that when our learning procedure
  is applied to adjacent patches of two-dimensional images, it allows a neural network
  that has no prior knowledge of the third dimension to discover depth in random dot
  stereograms of curved surfaces.
