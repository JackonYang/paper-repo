paperAbstract: "In spite of their superior performance, neural probabilistic language\
  \ models (NPLMs) remain far less widely used than n-gram models due to their notoriously\
  \ long training times, which are measured in weeks even for moderately-sized datasets.\
  \ Training NPLMs is computationally expensive because they are explicitly normalized,\
  \ which leads to having to consider all words in the vocabulary when computing the\
  \ log-likelihood gradients. \n \nWe propose a fast and simple algorithm for training\
  \ NPLMs based on noise-contrastive estimation, a newly introduced procedure for\
  \ estimating unnormalized continuous distributions. We investigate the behaviour\
  \ of the algorithm on the Penn Treebank corpus and show that it reduces the training\
  \ times by more than an order of magnitude without affecting the quality of the\
  \ resulting models. The algorithm is also more efficient and much more stable than\
  \ importance sampling because it requires far fewer noise samples to perform well.\
  \ \n \nWe demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach by training several\
  \ neural language models on a 47M-word corpus with a 80K-word vocabulary, obtaining\
  \ state-of-the-art results on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge\
  \ dataset."
