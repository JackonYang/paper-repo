paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The problem of image texture analysis is introduced, and
  existing approaches are surveyed. An empirical evaluation method is applied to two
  texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation
  statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and
  evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform
  better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can
  be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram
  equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with
  small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image
  values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures
  with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued
  and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions.
  The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window
  size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of
  discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural
  texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy
  planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either
  texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15
  blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72% were achieved with co- occurrence
  statistics, 65% with augmented correlation statistics, and 94% with texture energy
  statistics.'
