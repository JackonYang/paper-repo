paperAbstract: "Parametric correspondence is a technique for matching images to a\
  \ three dimensional symbolic reference map. An analytic camera model is used to\
  \ predict the location and appearance of landmarks in the image, generating a projection\
  \ for an assumed viewpoint. Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters\
  \ of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic\
  \ description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features\
  \ is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares\
  \ the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear\
  \ dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially\
  \ extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous\
  \ matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image\
  \ based correlation matching."
