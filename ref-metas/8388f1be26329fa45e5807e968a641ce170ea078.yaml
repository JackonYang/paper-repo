paperAbstract: In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs)
  has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised
  learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge
  the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
  We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks
  (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they
  are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets,
  we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns
  a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator
  and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating
  their applicability as general image representations.
