paperAbstract: "This clearly written , mathematically rigorous text includes a novel\
  \ algorithmic exposition of the simplex method and also discusses the Soviet ellipsoid\
  \ algorithm for linear programming; efficient algorithms for network flow, matching,\
  \ spanning trees, and matroids; the theory of NP-complete problems; approximation\
  \ algorithms, local search heuristics for NPcomplete problems, more. All chapters\
  \ are supplemented by thoughtprovoking problems. A useful work for graduate-level\
  \ students with backgrounds in computer science, operations research, and electrical\
  \ engineering. Mathematicians wishing a self-contained introduction need look no\
  \ further.\u2014American Mathematical Monthly. 1982 ed."
