paperAbstract: We present a method for object categorization in real-world scenes.
  Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground
  segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard
  approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the
  object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation
  into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which
  integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition
  and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying
  the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this
  confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects
  in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based
  criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard
  dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the
  literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms
  previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training
  examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the
  proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations
  and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion.
