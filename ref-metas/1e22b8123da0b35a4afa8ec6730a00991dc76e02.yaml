paperAbstract: This paper describes a handwritten character string recognition system
  for Japanese mail address reading on a very large vocabulary. The address phrases
  are recognized as a whole because there is no extra space between words. The lexicon
  contains 111,349 address phrases, which are stored in a trie structure. In recognition,
  the text line image is matched with the lexicon entries (phrases) to obtain reliable
  segmentation and retrieve valid address phrases. The paper first introduces some
  effective techniques for text line image preprocessing and presegmentation. In presegmentation,
  the text line image is separated into primitive segments by connected component
  analysis and touching pattern splitting based on contour shape analysis. In lexicon
  matching, consecutive segments are dynamically combined into candidate character
  patterns. An accurate character classifier is embedded in lexicon matching to select
  characters matched with a candidate pattern from a dynamic category set. A beam
  search strategy is used to control the lexicon matching so as to achieve real-time
  recognition. In experiments on 3,589 live mail images, the proposed method achieved
  correct rate of 83.68 percent while the error rate is less than 1 percent.
