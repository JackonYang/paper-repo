paperAbstract: "Abstract This paper extends the face detection framework proposedby\
  \ Viola and Jones 2001 to handle pro\uFB01le views and rotatedfaces. As in the work\
  \ of Rowley et al 1998. and Schneider-man et al. 2000, we build different detectors\
  \ for differentviews of the face. A decision tree is then trained to deter-mine\
  \ the viewpoint class (such as right pro\uFB01le or rotated60 degrees) for a given\
  \ window of the image being exam-ined. This is similar to the approach of Rowley\
  \ et al. 1998.The appropriate detector for that viewpoint can then be runinstead\
  \ of running all detectors on all windows. This tech-niqueyields goodresults and\
  \ maintainsthe speed advantageof the Viola-Jones detector. 1. Introduction There\
  \ are a number of techniques that can successfullydetect frontal upright faces in\
  \ a wide variety of images[11, 7, 10, 12, 3, 6]. While the de\uFB01nition of \u201C\
  frontal\u201D and\u201Cupright\u201Dmayvaryfromsystem to system, the reality is\
  \ thatmany natural images contain rotated or pro\uFB01le faces thatare not reliably\
  \ detected. There are a small number of sys-tems which explicitly address non-frontal,\
  \ or non-uprightface detection [8, 10, 2]. This paper describes progress to-ward\
  \ a system which can detect faces regardless of posereliably and in real-time.This\
  \ paperextendsthe frameworkproposedby Viola andJones [12]. This approach is selected\
  \ because of its compu-tational ef\uFB01ciency and simplicity.One observation which\
  \ is shared among all previous re-lated work is that a multi-view detector must\
  \ be carefullyconstructed by combining a collection of detectors eachtrained for\
  \ a single viewpoint. It appears that a monolithicapproach, where a single classi\uFB01\
  er is trained to detect allposes of a face, is unlearnable with existing classi\uFB01\
  ers. Ourinformal experiments lend support to this conclusion, sincea classi\uFB01\
  er trained on all poses appears to be hopelessly in-accurate.This paper addresses\
  \ two types of pose variation: non-frontal faces, which are rotated out of the image\
  \ plane, andnon-upright faces, which are rotated in the image plane.In both cases\
  \ the multi-view detector presented in this pa-per is a combination of Viola-Jones\
  \ detectors, each detectortrained on face data taken from a single viewpoint.Reliable\
  \ non-upright face detection was \uFB01rst presentedin a paper by Rowley, Baluja\
  \ and Kanade [8]. They traintwo neural network classi\uFB01ers. The \uFB01rst estimates\
  \ the poseof a face in the detection window. The second is a conven-tional face\
  \ detector. Faces are detected in three steps: foreach image window the pose of\
  \ \u201Cface\u201D is \uFB01rst estimated; thepose estimate is then used to de-rotate\
  \ the image window;the window is then classi\uFB01ed by the second detector. Fornon-face\
  \ windows, the poses estimate must be consideredrandom. Nevertheless, a rotated\
  \ non-faceshouldbe rejectedby the conventional detector. One potential \uFB02aw\
  \ of such asystem is that the \uFB01nal detection rate is roughly the productof\
  \ the correct classi\uFB01cation rates of the two classi\uFB01ers (sincethe errors\
  \ of the two classi\uFB01ers are somewhat independent).One could adopt the Rowley\
  \ et al. three step approachwhile replacingthe classi\uFB01ers with those of Viola\
  \ andJones.The \uFB01nal system would be more ef\uFB01cient, but not signi\uFB01\
  -cantly. Classi\uFB01cation by the Viola-Jones system is so ef\uFB01-cient, that\
  \ derotation would dominate the computational ex-pense. In principle derotation\
  \ is not strictly necessary sinceit should be possible to construct a detector for\
  \ rotated facesdirectly. Detection becomes a two stage process. First thepose of\
  \ the window is estimated and then one ofrotationspeci\uFB01c detectors is called\
  \ upon to classify the window.In this paper detection of non-upright faces is handledusing\
  \ the two stage approach. In the \uFB01rst stage the pose ofeach window is estimated\
  \ using a decision tree constructedusing features like those described by Viola\
  \ and Jones. Inthe second stage one ofpose speci\uFB01c Viola-Jones dete-tectors\
  \ are used to classify the window.Oncepose speci\uFB01c detectors are trained and\
  \ available,an alternative detection process can be tested as well. In thiscase\
  \ alldetectors are evaluated and the union of their de-"
