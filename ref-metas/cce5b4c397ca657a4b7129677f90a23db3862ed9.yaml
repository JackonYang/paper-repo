paperAbstract: This paper presents a text word extraction algorithm that takes a set
  of bounding boxes of glyphs and their associated text lines of a given document
  and partitions the glyphs into a set of text words, using only the geometric information
  of the input glyphs. The algorithm is probability based. An iterative, relaxation-like
  method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability.
  To evaluate the performance of our test word extraction algorithm, we used a 3-fold
  validation method and developed a quantitative performance measure. The algorithm
  was evaluated on the UW-III database of some 1600 scanned document image pages.
  An area-overlap measure was used to find the correspondence between the detected
  entities and the ground-truth. For a total of 827, 433 ground truth words, the algorithm
  identified and segmented 800, 149 words correctly, an accuracy of 97.43%.
