paperAbstract: In this paper, we study the use of unlabeled sam- ples in reducing
  the problem of small training sample size that can severely affect the recognition
  rate of classifiers when the dimensionality of the multispectral data is high. We
  show that by using additional unlabeled samples that are available at no extra cost,
  the performance may be improved, and therefore the Hughes phenomenon can be mitigated.
  Furthermore, by ex- periments, we show that by using additional unlabeled samples
  more representative estimates can be obtained. We also pro- pose a semiparametric
  method for incorporating the training (Le., labeled) and unlabeled samples simultaneously
  into the parameter estimation process.
