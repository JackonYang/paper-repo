paperAbstract: 'Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such
  as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly
  confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional
  structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts
  the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory
  inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small
  number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving
  dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information
  to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques
  such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our
  approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie
  complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under
  different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality
  reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important
  class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.'
