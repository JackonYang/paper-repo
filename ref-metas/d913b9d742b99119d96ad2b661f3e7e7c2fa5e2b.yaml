paperAbstract: 'Given a large repository of geotagged imagery, we seek to automatically
  find visual elements, e. g. windows, balconies, and street signs, that are most
  distinctive for a certain geo-spatial area, for example the city of Paris. This
  is a tremendously difficult task as the visual features distinguishing architectural
  elements of different places can be very subtle. In addition, we face a hard search
  problem: given all possible patches in all images, which of them are both frequently
  occurring and geographically informative? To address these issues, we propose to
  use a discriminative clustering approach able to take into account the weak geographic
  supervision. We show that geographically representative image elements can be discovered
  automatically from Google Street View imagery in a discriminative manner. We demonstrate
  that these elements are visually interpretable and perceptually geo-informative.
  The discovered visual elements can also support a variety of computational geography
  tasks, such as mapping architectural correspondences and influences within and across
  cities, finding representative elements at different geo-spatial scales, and geographically-informed
  image retrieval.'
