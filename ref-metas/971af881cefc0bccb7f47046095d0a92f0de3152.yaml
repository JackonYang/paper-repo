paperAbstract: Describes a prototype system for assigning table cells to their proper
  place in the logical structure of the table, based on a simple model of table structure
  combined with a number of measures of cohesion between cells. A framework is presented
  for examining the effect of particular variables on the performance of the system,
  and preliminary results are presented showing the effect of cohesion measures based
  on the simplest domain-independent analyses, with the aim allowing future comparison
  with more knowledge-intensive analyses based on natural language processing. These
  baseline results suggest that very simple string-based cohesion measures are not
  sufficient to support the extraction of tuples as we require. Future work will pursue
  the aim of more adequate approximations to a notional subtype/supertype definition
  of the relationship between value cells and label cells.
