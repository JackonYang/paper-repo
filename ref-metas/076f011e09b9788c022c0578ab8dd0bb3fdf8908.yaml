paperAbstract: 'This paper discusses the question: Can we improve the recognition
  of objects by using their spatial context? We start from Bag-of-Words models and
  use the Pascal 2007 dataset. We use the rough object bounding boxes that come with
  this dataset to investigate the fundamental gain context can bring. Our main contributions
  are: (I) The result of Zhang et al. in CVPR07 that context is superfluous derived
  from the Pascal 2005 data set of 4 classes does not generalize to this dataset.
  For our larger and more realistic dataset context is important indeed. (II) Using
  the rough bounding box to limit or extend the scope of an object during both training
  and testing, we find that the spatial extent of an object is determined by its category:
  (a) well-defined, rigid objects have the object itself as the preferred spatial
  extent. (b) Non-rigid objects have an unbounded spatial extent : all spatial extents
  produce equally good results. (c) Objects primarily categorised based on their function
  have the whole image as their spatial extent. Finally, (III) using the rough bounding
  box to treat object and context separately, we find that the upper bound of improvement
  is 26% (12% absolute) in terms of mean average precision, and this bound is likely
  to be higher if the localisation is done using segmentation. It is concluded that
  object localisation, if done sufficiently precise, helps considerably in the recognition
  of objects for the Pascal 2007 dataset.'
