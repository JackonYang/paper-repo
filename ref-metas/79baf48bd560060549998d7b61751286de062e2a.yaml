paperAbstract: 'We present two simple ways of reducing the number of parameters and
  accelerating the training of large Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: the first
  one is "matrix factorization by design" of LSTM matrix into the product of two smaller
  matrices, and the second one is partitioning of LSTM matrix, its inputs and states
  into the independent groups. Both approaches allow us to train large LSTM networks
  significantly faster to the near state-of the art perplexity while using significantly
  less RNN parameters.'
