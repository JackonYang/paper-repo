paperAbstract: The main aim of this paper is to provide a tutorial on regression with
  Gaussian processes. We start from Bayesian linear regression, and show how by a
  change of viewpoint one can see this method as a Gaussian process predictor based
  on priors over functions, rather than on priors over parameters. This leads in to
  a more general discussion of Gaussian processes in section 4. Section 5 deals with
  further issues, including hierarchical modelling and the setting of the parameters
  that control the Gaussian process, the covariance functions for neural network models
  and the use of Gaussian processes in classification problems.
