paperAbstract: "In considering the statistics of the \u2018no-field\u2019 square Ising\
  \ lattice in which each unit is capable of two configurations and only nearest neighbours\
  \ interact, Kramers and Wannier (3) were able to deduce an inversion transformation\
  \ under which the partition function of the lattice is invariant when the temperature\
  \ is transformed from a low to a high (\u2018inverted\u2019) value. The important\
  \ property of this inversion transformation is that its fixed point gives the transition\
  \ point of the lattice."
