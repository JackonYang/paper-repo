paperAbstract: A previously proposed model for memory based on neurophysiolo gical
  considerations is reviewed. We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully
  represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of
  neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses
  associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity
  proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix
  of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback
  of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate.
  A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain
  characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply
  the model to "categorical perception." Finally, we discuss probability learning.
  The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in
  systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy.
