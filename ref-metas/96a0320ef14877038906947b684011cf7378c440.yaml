paperAbstract: We present a method that learns representations for word meanings from
  short video clips paired with sentences. Unlike prior work on learning language
  from symbolic input, our input consists of video of people interacting with multiple
  complex objects in outdoor environments. Unlike prior computer-vision approaches
  that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are
  sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence
  between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even
  when the video depicts simultaneous events described by multiple sentences or when
  different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned
  word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of
  new video.
