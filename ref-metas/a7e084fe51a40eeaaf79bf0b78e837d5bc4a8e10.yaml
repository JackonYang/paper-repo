paperAbstract: A program that tags each word in an input sentence with the most likely
  part of speech has been written. The program uses a linear-time dynamic programming
  algorithm to find an assignment of parts of speech to words that optimizes the product
  of (a) lexical probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given word
  i) and (b) contextual probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given
  n following parts of speech). Program performance is encouraging; a 400-word sample
  is presented and is judged to be 99.5% correct.<<ETX>>
