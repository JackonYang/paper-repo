paperAbstract: A new method has been designed to identify and locate objects lying
  on a flat surface. The merit of the approach is to provide strong robustness to
  partial occlusions (due for instance to uneven lighting conditions, shadows, highlights,
  touching and overlapping objects) thanks to a local and compact description of the
  objects boundaries and to a new fast recognition method involving generation and
  recursive evaluation of hypotheses named HYPER (HY potheses Predicted and Evaluated
  Recursively). The method has been integrated within a vision system coupled to an
  indutrial robot arm, to provide automatic picking and repositioning of partially
  overlapping industrial parts.
