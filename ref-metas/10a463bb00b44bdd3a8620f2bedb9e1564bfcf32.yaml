paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nWith this text, you gain an understanding of\
  \ the fundamental concepts of algorithms, the very heart of computer science. It\
  \ introduces the basic data structures and programming techniques often used in\
  \ efficient algorithms. Covers use of lists, push-down stacks, queues, trees, and\
  \ graphs. Later chapters go into sorting, searching and graphing algorithms, the\
  \ string-matching algorithms, and the Schonhage-Strassen integer-multiplication\
  \ algorithm. Provides numerous graded exercises at the end of each chapter. \n \n\
