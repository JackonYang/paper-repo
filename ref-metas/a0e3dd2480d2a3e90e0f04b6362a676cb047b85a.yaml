paperAbstract: Like other recent work in the field of generative-transformational
  grammar, this book developed from a realization that many problems in linguistics
  involve semantics too deeply to be solved insightfully within the syntactic theory
  of Noam Chomsky's Aspect of the Theory of Syntax. Dr Jackendoff has attempted to
  take a broader view of semantics, studying the important contribution it makes to
  the syntactic patterns of English.The research is carried out in the framework of
  an interpretive theory, that is, a theory of grammar in which syntactic structures
  are given interpretations by an autonomous syntactic component. The book investigates
  a wide variety of semantic rules, stating them in considerable detail and extensively
  treating their consequences for the syntactic component of the grammar. In particular,
  it is shown that the hypothesis that transformations do not change meaning must
  be abandoned; but equally stringent restrictions on transformations are formulated
  within the interpretive theory.Among the areas of grammar discussed are the well-known
  problems of case relations, pronominalization, negation, and quantifiers. In addition,
  the author presents semantic analyses of such neglected areas as adverbs and intonation
  contours; he also proposes radically new approaches to the so-called Crossover Principle,
  the control problem for complement subjects, parentheticals, and the interpretation
  of nonspecific noun phrases.
