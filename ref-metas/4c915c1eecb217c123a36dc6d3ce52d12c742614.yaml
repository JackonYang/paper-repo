paperAbstract: This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement
  learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These
  algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in
  a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement
  tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this
  without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from
  which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are
  presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms
  while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given
  are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation.
  We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the
  use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as
  well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially
  more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.
