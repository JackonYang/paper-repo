paperAbstract: This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval
  quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information
  retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less
  relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval
  functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from
  relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply.
  The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for
  training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of
  links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available
  in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine
  (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From
  a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization
  framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries
  and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It
  shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search
  engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval
  quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.
