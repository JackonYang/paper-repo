paperAbstract: 'Smart watch is becoming a new gateway through which people stay connected
  and track everyday activities, and text-entry on it is becoming a frequent need.
  With the two de facto solutions: tap-on-screen and voice input, text-entry on the
  watch remains a tedious task because 1. Tap-on-screen is error prone due to the
  small screen; 2. Voice input is strongly constrained by the surroundings and suffers
  from privacy leak. In this paper, we propose SHOW, which enables the user to input
  as they handwrite on horizontal surfaces, and the only requirement is to use the
  elbow as the support point. SHOW captures the gyroscope and accelerometer traces
  and deduces the user''s handwriting thereafter. SHOW differs from previous work
  of gesture recognition in that: 1. it employs a novel rotation injection technique
  to substantially reduce the effort of data collection; 2. it does not require whole-arm
  posture, hence is better suited to space-limited places (e.g. vehicles). Our experiments
  show that SHOW can effectively generate 60 traces from one real handwriting trace
  and achieve high accuracy at 99.9% when recognizing the 62 different characters
  written by 10 volunteers. Furthermore, having more screen space after removing the
  virtual keyboard, SHOW can display 4x candidate words for autocompletion. Aided
  by the tolerance of character ambiguity and accurate character recognition, SHOW
  achieves over 70% lower mis-recognition-rate, 43% lower no-response-rate in both
  daily and general purposed text-entry scenarios, and 33.3% higher word suggestion
  coverage than the tap-on-screen method using a virtual QWERTY keyboard.'
