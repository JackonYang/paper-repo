paperAbstract: We address the problem of learning object class models and object segmentations
  from unannotated images. We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised
  segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues
  of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model
  is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for
  significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's
  position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about
  any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show
  that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst
  also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally,
  we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the
  learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery
  and tracking in video.
