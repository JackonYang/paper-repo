paperAbstract: "The Bayesian derivation of \u201CClassic\u201D MaxEnt image processing\
  \ (Skilling 1989a) shows that exp(\u03B1S(f,m)), where S(f,m) is the entropy of\
  \ image f relative to model m, is the only consistent prior probability distribution\
  \ for positive, additive images. In this paper the derivation of \u201CClassic\u201D\
  \ MaxEnt is completed, showing that it leads to a natural choice for the regularising\
  \ parameter \u03B1, that supersedes the traditional practice of setting x2=N. The\
  \ new condition is that the dimensionless measure of structure -2\u03B1S should\
  \ be equal to the number of good singular values contained in the data. The performance\
  \ of this new condition is discussed with reference to image deconvolution, but\
  \ leads to a reconstruction that is visually disappointing. A deeper hypothesis\
  \ space is proposed that overcomes these difficulties, by allowing for spatial correlations\
  \ across the image."
