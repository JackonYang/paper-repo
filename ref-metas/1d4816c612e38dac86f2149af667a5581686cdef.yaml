paperAbstract: A nonparametric and unsupervised method ofautomatic threshold selection
  for picture segmentation is presented. An optimal threshold is selected by the discriminant
  criterion, namely, so as to maximize the separability of the resultant classes in
  gray levels. The procedure is very simple, utilizing only the zerothand the first-order
  cumulative moments of the gray-level histogram. It is straightforward to extend
  the method to multithreshold problems. Several experimental results are also presented
  to support the validity of the method.
