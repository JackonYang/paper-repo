paperAbstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient facial image representation
  based on local binary pattern (LBP) texture features. The face image is divided
  into several regions from which the LBP feature distributions are extracted and
  concatenated into an enhanced feature vector to be used as a face descriptor. The
  performance of the proposed method is assessed in the face recognition problem under
  different challenges. Other applications and several extensions are also discussed
