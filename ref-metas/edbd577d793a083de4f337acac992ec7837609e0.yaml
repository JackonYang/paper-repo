paperAbstract: An important step towards the goal of table understanding is a method
  for reliable table detection. This paper describes a general solution for detecting
  tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number
  of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization
  problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality
  measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the
  presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality
  measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis.
  These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We
  report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both
  ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation
  of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting
  research questions.
