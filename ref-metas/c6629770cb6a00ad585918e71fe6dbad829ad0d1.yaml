paperAbstract: This paper presents an application of recurrent networks for phone
  probability estimation in large vocabulary speech recognition. The need for efficient
  exploitation of context information is discussed; a role for which the recurrent
  net appears suitable. An overview of early developments of recurrent nets for phone
  recognition is given along with the more recent improvements that include their
  integration with Markov models. Recognition results are presented for the DARPA
  TIMIT and Resource Management tasks, and it is concluded that recurrent nets are
  competitive with traditional means for performing phone probability estimation.
