paperAbstract: "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system\
  \ for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as\
  \ the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of\
  \ visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting\
  \ \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous\
  \ features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another\
  \ advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without\
  \ explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This\
  \ contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning\
  \ algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical\
  \ evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of\
  \ a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment\
  \ invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches\
  \ detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one\
  \ of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches\
  \ for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work\
  \ on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or\
  \ complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the\
  \ objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art\
  \ (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects\
  \ are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results\
  \ indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features\
  \ from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant\
  \ step towards generic object recognition."
