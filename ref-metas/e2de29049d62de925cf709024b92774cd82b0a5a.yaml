paperAbstract: 'This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can
  be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large
  pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification
  problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled
  documents are readily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled
  and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM)
  and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the
  available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents.
  It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates
  to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the
  generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated
  in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm
  that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor
  to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple
  mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three
  different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification
  error by up to 30%.'
