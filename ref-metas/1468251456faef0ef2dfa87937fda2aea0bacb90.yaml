paperAbstract: This paper presents a representation for three-dimensional objects
  in terms of affine-invariant image patches and their spatial relationships. Multi-view
  constraints associated with groups of patches are combined with a normalized representation
  of their appearance to guide matching and reconstruction, allowing the acquisition
  of true three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models from multiple images and their
  recognition in a single photograph taken from an arbitrary viewpoint. The proposed
  approach does not require a separate segmentation stage and is applicable to cluttered
  scenes. Preliminary modeling and recognition results are presented.
