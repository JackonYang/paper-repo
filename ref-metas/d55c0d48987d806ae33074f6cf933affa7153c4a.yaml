paperAbstract: In this paper we propose a fully automatic hierarchical method for
  identification of forms using global as well as local features. Moments of certain
  orders are considered as global shape features and are utilised to reduce the search
  space by selecting a subset of forms present in the database. The type of the candidate
  form is then identified within this subset through detail analysis using local geometrical
  and topological features. The candidate form is then segmented to extract the user-filled
  information.
