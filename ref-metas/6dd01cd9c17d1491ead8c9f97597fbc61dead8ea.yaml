paperAbstract: An unsupervised learning algorithm for a multilayer network of stochastic
  neurons is described. Bottom-up "recognition" connections convert the input into
  representations in successive hidden layers, and top-down "generative" connections
  reconstruct the representation in one layer from the representation in the layer
  above. In the "wake" phase, neurons are driven by recognition connections, and generative
  connections are adapted to increase the probability that they would reconstruct
  the correct activity vector in the layer below. In the "sleep" phase, neurons are
  driven by generative connections, and recognition connections are adapted to increase
  the probability that they would produce the correct activity vector in the layer
  above.
