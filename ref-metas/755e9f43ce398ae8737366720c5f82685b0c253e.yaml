paperAbstract: This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even
  if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge
  about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous
  zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes,
  our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining
  state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable
  performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words
  in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep
  learning model does not require any manually defined semantic or visual features
  for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors
  corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to
  distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection
  methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty
  detection strategies; the first gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the
  second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes'
  accuracy high.
