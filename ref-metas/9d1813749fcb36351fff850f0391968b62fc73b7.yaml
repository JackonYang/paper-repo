paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a large scale general purpose image database with
  human annotated ground truth. Firstly, an all-in-all labeling framework is proposed
  to group visual knowledge of three levels: scene level (global geometric description),
  object level (segmentation, sketch representation, hierarchical decomposition),
  and low-mid level (2.1D layered representation, object boundary attributes, curve
  completion, etc.). Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In
  addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down
  labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With
  this tool, we''ve been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748
  annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common
  subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors.'
