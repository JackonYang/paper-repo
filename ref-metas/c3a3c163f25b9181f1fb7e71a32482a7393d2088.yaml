paperAbstract: 'Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument
  structure of a sentence. It is typically regarded as an important step in the standard
  NLP pipeline. As the semantic representations are closely related to syntactic ones,
  we exploit syntactic information in our model. We propose a version of graph convolutional
  networks (GCNs), a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, suited to
  model syntactic dependency graphs. GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used
  as sentence encoders, producing latent feature representations of words in a sentence.
  We observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both GCN
  and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already state-of-the-art
  LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the standard benchmark
  (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.'
