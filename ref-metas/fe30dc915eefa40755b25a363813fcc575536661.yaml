paperAbstract: 'Automatic part of speech tagging is an area of natural language processing
  where statistical techniques have been more successful than rule-based methods.
  In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically
  acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The
  rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction
  in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules,
  ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability
  from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution
  of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable
  method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that
  automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for
  researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more
  expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective
  theme described below.'
