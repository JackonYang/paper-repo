paperAbstract: "A fundamental problem in learning and reasoning about a set of information\
  \ is finding the right representation. The primary goal of an unsupervised learning\
  \ procedure is to optimize the quality of a system's internal representation. In\
  \ this thesis, we present a general framework for describing unsupervised learning\
  \ procedures based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle\
  \ states that the best model is one that minimizes the summed description length\
  \ of the model and the data with respect to the model. Applying this approach to\
  \ the unsupervised learning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracy\
  \ of a representation (i.e., how concise a description of the input may be generated\
  \ from it) and its succinctness (i.e., how compactly the representation itself can\
  \ be described). \nViewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of\
  \ the framework exposes their implicit assumptions about the type of structure assumed\
  \ to underlie the data. While these existing algorithms typically minimize the data\
  \ description using a fixed length representation, we use the framework to derive\
  \ a class of objective functions for training self-supervised neural networks, where\
  \ the goal is to minimize the description length of the representation simultaneously\
  \ with that of the data. Formulating a description of the representation forces\
  \ assumptions about the structure of the data to be made explicit, which in turn\
  \ leads to a particular network configuration as well as an objective function that\
  \ can be used to optimize the network parameters. We describe three new learning\
  \ algorithms derived in this manner from the MDL framework. Each algorithm embodies\
  \ a different scheme for describing the internal representation, and is therefore\
  \ suited to a range of datasets based on the structure underlying the data. Simulations\
  \ demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms on some simple computational\
  \ vision tasks."
