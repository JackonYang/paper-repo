paperAbstract: 'We present an unsupervised technique for visual learning which is
  based on density estimation in high-dimensional spaces using an eigenspace decomposition.
  Two types of density estimates are derived for modeling the training data: a multivariate
  Gaussian (for a unimodal distributions) and a multivariate Mixture-of-Gaussians
  model (for multimodal distributions). These probability densities are then used
  to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target
  detection for automatic object recognition. This learning technique is tested in
  experiments with modeling and subsequent detection of human faces and non-rigid
  objects such as hands.<<ETX>>'
