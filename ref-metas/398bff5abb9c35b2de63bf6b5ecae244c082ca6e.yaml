paperAbstract: "This thesis is concerned with the problem of visual object categorization,\
  \ that is of reeognizing unseen-before objects, localizing them in cluttered real-worid\
  \ images, and assigning the correct category label. This capability is one of the\
  \ core compe\xAC tencies of the human visual system. Yet, Computer vision Systems\
  \ are still far from reaching a comparable level of Performance.Moreover,Computer\
  \ visionresearch has in the past mainly focused on the simpler and more specific\
  \ problem of identifying known objects under novel viewing conditions. The visual\
  \ categorization problem is closely linked to the task of figure-ground segmentation,\
  \ that is of dividing the image into an object and a non-objeet part. Historically,\
  \ figure-ground segmentation has often been seen as an important and even necessary\
  \ preprocessing step for object recognition. However, purely bottomup approacheshave\
  \ so far been unable to yield segmentationsof sufficient quality, so that most current\
  \ recognition approacheshave been designed to work independently from segmentation.\
  \ In contrast,this thesis considers object categorization and figure-ground segmen\xAC\
  \ tation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common\
  \ goal. The core part of our work is a probabilisticformulation which integrates\
  \ both capabilities into a common framework. As shown in our experiments, the tight\
  \ coupling between those two processes allows them to profit from each other and\
  \ improve their individual Performances. The resulting approach can detect categorical\
  \ objects in novel images and automatically compute a segmentationfor them. This\
  \ segmenta\xAC tion is then used to again improve recognition by allowing the System\
  \ to focus its effort on object pixels and discard misleading influencesfrom the\
  \ background. In addition to improving the recognition Performance for individual\
  \ hypotheses, the top-down segmentation also allows to determine exactly from where\
  \ a hypoth\xAC esis draws its support. We use this information to design a hypothesis\
  \ verification stage based on the MDL principle that resolves ambiguities between\
  \ overlapping hypotheseson a per-pixel level and factorsout the effects of partialocclusion.\
  \ Altogether, this procedureconstitutes a novel mechanismin object detection that\
  \ allows to analyze scenes containing multiple objects in a principled manner. Our\
  \ results show that it presents an improvement over conventional criteria based\
  \ on bounding box overlap and permitsmore aecurate aeeeptancedecisions. Our approach\
  \ is based on a highly flexible implicit representation for object shape that can\
  \ combine the information of local parts observed on different training exam\xAC\
  \ ples and interpolate between the correspondingobjects. As a result, the proposed\
  \ method can learn object modeis already from few training examples and achieve\
  \ competitive object detection Performance with training sets that are between one\
  \ and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable Systems. An\
  \ extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the system is applicable\
  \ to many different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects."
