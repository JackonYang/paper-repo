paperAbstract: '2. Impulse activity was recorded from neurons in fovea1 striate (A17)
  and prestriate (Al@ cortex of monkeys trained to fixate monocularly and binocularly
  by rewarding them for detecting an abrupt change in the intensity of a small luminous
  spot. During periods of fixation, single bright or dark narrow bars moving across
  a frontoparallel plane were presented at a series of different depths. 2. Nearly
  all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were
  classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that
  gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and
  those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular
  interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of
  the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned
  excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a
  narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer
  and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory
  neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane
  of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation
  plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near
  neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks
  and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance
  (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction,
  even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4. The results
  suggest that there are cells in fovea1 striate and prestriate which may be part
