paperAbstract: 'We have established a preprocessing method for determining the meaningfulness
  of a table to allow for information extraction from tables on the Internet. A table
  offers a preeminent clue in text mining because it contains meaningful data displayed
  in rows and columns. However, tables are used on the Internet for both knowledge
  structuring and document design. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether
  or not a table has meaningfulness that is related to the structural information
  provided at the abstraction level of the table head. Accordingly, we: 1) investigated
  the types of tables present in HTML documents, 2) established the features that
  distinguished meaningful tables from others, 3) constructed a training data set
  using the established features after having filtered any obvious decorative tables,
  and 4) constructed a classification model using a decision tree. Based on these
  features, we set up heuristics for table head extraction from meaningful tables,
  and obtained an F-measure of 95.0 percent in distinguishing meaningful tables from
  decorative tables and an accuracy of 82.1 percent in extracting the table head from
  the meaningful tables.'
