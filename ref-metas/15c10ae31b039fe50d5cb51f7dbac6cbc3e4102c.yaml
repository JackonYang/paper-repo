paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in
  Bayesian networks. This method, "Expectation Propagation," unifies two previous
  techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy
  belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy
  belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited
  class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation
  approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and
  varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network.
  This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes.
  Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly
  better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace''s method, variational
  Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm
  for training Bayes point machine classifiers.'
