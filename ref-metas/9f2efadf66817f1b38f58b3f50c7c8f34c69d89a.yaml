paperAbstract: 'In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of
  four stages: detect => align => represent => classify. We revisit both the alignment
  step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order
  to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from
  a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million
  parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather
  than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial
  dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging
  to more than 4, 000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate
  model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well
  to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method
  reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing
  the error of the current state of the art by more than 27%, closely approaching
  human-level performance.'
