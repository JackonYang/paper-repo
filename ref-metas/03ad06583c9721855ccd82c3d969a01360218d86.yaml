paperAbstract: "In all previous work on deep multi-task learning we are aware of,\
  \ all task supervisions are on the same (outermost) layer. We present a multi-task\
  \ learning architecture with deep bi-directional RNNs, where different tasks supervision\
  \ can happen at different layers. We present experiments in syntactic chunking and\
  \ CCG supertagging, coupled with the additional task of POS-tagging. We show that\
  \ it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost rather than\
  \ the outermost layer. We argue that this is because \u201Clowlevel\u201D tasks\
  \ are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks to make use\
  \ of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally, we also show how\
  \ this architecture can be used for domain adaptation."
