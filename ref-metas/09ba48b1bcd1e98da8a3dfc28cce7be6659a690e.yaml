paperAbstract: "The paper presents a framework for extracting low level features.\
  \ Its main goal is to explicitely exploit the information content of the image as\
  \ far as possible. This leads to new techniques for deriving image parameters, to\
  \ either the elimination or the elucidation of \u201Dbuttons\u201D, like thresholds,\
  \ and to interpretable quality measures for the results, which may be used in subsequent\
  \ steps. Feature extraction is based on local statistics of the image function.\
  \ Methods are available for blind estimation of a signal dependent noise variance,\
  \ for feature preserving restoration, for feature detection and classification,\
  \ and for the location of general edges and points. Their favorable scale space\
  \ properties are discussed."
