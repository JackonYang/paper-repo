paperAbstract: We present WIKIREADING, a large-scale natural language understanding
  task and publicly-available dataset with 18 million instances. The task is to predict
  textual values from the structured knowledge base Wikidata by reading the text of
  the corresponding Wikipedia articles. The task contains a rich variety of challenging
  classification and extraction sub-tasks, making it well-suited for end-to-end models
  such as deep neural networks (DNNs). We compare various state-of-the-art DNNbased
  architectures for document classification, information extraction, and question
  answering. We find that models supporting a rich answer space, such as word or character
  sequences, perform best. Our best-performing model, a word-level sequence to sequence
  model with a mechanism to copy out-of-vocabulary words, obtains an accuracy of 71.8%.
