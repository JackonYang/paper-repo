paperAbstract: Text detection in stores has valuable applications that could transform
  the shopping experience, yet cluttered store environments present distinct challenges
  for existing techniques. We propose a strategy for text detection in stores that
  exploits a repetition prior. Leveraging the fact that shops typically display multiple
  instances of the same product on the shelf, our approach localizes text regions
  with a global view of the image, preferring instances that have repeated support
  in the scene. On two challenging real-world datasets taken with a mobile phone and
  wearable camera, we demonstrate our method's substantial advantages compared to
  several state-of-the-art techniques in grocery store environments.
