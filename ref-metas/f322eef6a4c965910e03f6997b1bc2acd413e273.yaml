paperAbstract: Image and sentence matching has made great progress recently, but it
  remains challenging due to the large visual-semantic discrepancy. This mainly arises
  from that the representation of pixel-level image usually lacks of high-level semantic
  information as in its matched sentence. In this work, we propose a semantic-enhanced
  image and sentence matching model, which can improve the image representation by
  learning semantic concepts and then organizing them in a correct semantic order.
  Given an image, we first use a multi-regional multi-label CNN to predict its semantic
  concepts, including objects, properties, actions, etc. Then, considering that different
  orders of semantic concepts lead to diverse semantic meanings, we use a context-gated
  sentence generation scheme for semantic order learning. It simultaneously uses the
  image global context containing concept relations as reference and the groundtruth
  semantic order in the matched sentence as supervision. After obtaining the improved
  image representation, we learn the sentence representation with a conventional LSTM,
  and then jointly perform image and sentence matching and sentence generation for
  model learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned
  semantic concepts and order, by achieving the state-of-the-art results on two public
  benchmark datasets.
