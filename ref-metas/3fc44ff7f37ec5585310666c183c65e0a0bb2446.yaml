paperAbstract: This article describes three statistical models for natural language
  parsing. The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized
  grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence
  of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.
  Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization,
  ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement,
  and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by
  probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn
  Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other
  models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also
  give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall
  results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics
  of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies
  of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.
  Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank,
  aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various
  models.
