paperAbstract: We describe a new approach for learning to perform class-based segmentation
  using only unsegmented training examples. As in previous methods, we first use training
  images to extract fragments that contain common object parts. We then show how these
  parts can be segmented into their figure and ground regions in an automatic learning
  process. This is in contrast with previous approaches, which required complete manual
  segmentation of the objects in the training examples. The figure-ground learning
  combines top-down and bottom-up processes and proceeds in two stages, an initial
  approximation followed by iterative refinement. The initial approximation produces
  figure-ground labeling of individual image fragments using the unsegmented training
  images. It is based on the fact that on average, points inside the object are covered
  by more fragments than points outside it. The initial labeling is then improved
  by an iterative refinement process, which converges in up to three steps. At each
  step, the figure-ground labeling of individual fragments produces a segmentation
  of complete objects in the training images, which in turn induce a refined figure-ground
  labeling of the individual fragments. In this manner, we obtain a scheme that starts
  from unsegmented training images, learns the figure-ground labeling of image fragments,
  and then uses this labeling to segment novel images. Our experiments demonstrate
  that the learned segmentation achieves the same level of accuracy as methods using
  manual segmentation of training images, producing an automatic and robust top-down
  segmentation.
