paperAbstract: 'The problem of using pictures of objects captured under ideal imaging
  conditions (here referred to as in vitro) to recognize objects in natural environments
  (in situ) is an emerging area of interest in computer vision and pattern recognition.
  Examples of tasks in this vein include assistive vision systems for the blind and
  object recognition for mobile robots; the proliferation of image databases on the
  web is bound to lead to more examples in the near future. Despite its importance,
  there is still a need for a freely available database to facilitate study of this
  kind of training/testing dichotomy. In this work one of our contributions is a new
  multimedia database of 120 grocery products, GroZi-120. For every product, two different
  recordings are available: in vitro images extracted from the web, and in situ images
  extracted from camcorder video collected inside a grocery store. As an additional
  contribution, we present the results of applying three commonly used object recognition/detection
  algorithms (color histogram matching, SIFT matching, and boosted Haar-like features)
  to the dataset. Finally, we analyze the successes and failures of these algorithms
  against product type and imaging conditions, both in terms of recognition rate and
  localization accuracy, in order to suggest ways forward for further research in
  this domain.'
