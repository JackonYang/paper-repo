paperAbstract: Keyword-based search engines are in widespread use today as a popular
  means for Web-based information retrieval. Although such systems seem deceptively
  simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial
  information needs. This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing
  search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional
  users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in
  the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the
  user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query
  in that document ("the context"). The context-driven information retrieval process
  involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new,
  augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific
  search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context. Experimental
  results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced
  users an advanced search tool on the Web.
