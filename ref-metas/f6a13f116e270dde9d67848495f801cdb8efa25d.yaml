paperAbstract: "A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating\
  \ such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting\
  \ individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo\
  \ integration over configuration space. Results for the two\u2010dimensional rigid\u2010\
  sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here.\
  \ These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four\u2010\
  term virial coefficient expansion."
