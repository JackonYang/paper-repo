paperAbstract: The first in the present series of two papers described a computer
  program for multidimensional scaling on the basis of essentially nonmetric data.
  This second paper reports the results of two kinds of test applications of that
  program. The first application is to artificial data generated by monotonically
  transforming the interpoint distances in a known spatial configuration. The purpose
  is to show that the recovery of the original metric configuration does not depend
  upon the particular transformation used. The second application is to measures of
  interstimulus similarity and confusability obtained from some actual psychological
  experiments.
