paperAbstract: 1. Anatomical studies have shown the cortex of the posterior bank of
  the superior temporal sulcus to receive a projection from visual cortical areas,
  including areas 17, 18 and 19. In this paper the response of single neurones in
  this area to simple visual stimulation is reported. Ten monkeys were studied.
