paperAbstract: In this paper, a face localization system is proposed in which local
  detectors are coupled with a statistical model of the spatial arrangement of facial
  features to yield robust performance. The outputs from the local detectors are treated
  as candidate locations and constellations are formed from these. The effects of
  translation, rotation, and scale are eliminated by mapping to a set of shape variables.
  The constellations are then ranked according to the likelihood that the shape variables
  correspond to a face versus an alternative model. Incomplete constellations, which
  occur when some of the true features are missed, are handled in a principled way.
