paperAbstract: Abstract A scheme is presented for modeling and local computation of
  exact probabilities, means, and variances for mixed qualitative and quantitative
  variables. The models assume that the conditional distribution of the quantitative
  variables, given the qualitative, is multivariate Gaussian. The computational architecture
  is set up by forming a tree of belief universes, and the calculations are then performed
  by local message passing between universes. The asymmetry between the quantitative
  and qualitative variables sets some additional limitations for the specification
  and propagation structure. Approximate methods when these are not appropriately
  fulfilled are sketched. It has earlier been shown how to exploit the local structure
  in the specification of a discrete probability model for fast and efficient computation,
  thereby paving the way for exploiting probability-based models as parts of realistic
  systems for planning and decision support. The purpose of this article is to extend
  this computational s...
