paperAbstract: Recursive structure is commonly found in the inputs of different modalities
  such as natural scene images or natural language sentences. Discovering this recursive
  structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains
  but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure
  prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully
  recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same
  algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural
  language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches
  for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation
  and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance
  on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree
  outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%.
