paperAbstract: In previous work [10], we presented a class of upper bounds on the
  log partition function of an arbitrary undirected graphical model based on solving
  a convex variational problem. Here we develop a class of local message-passing algorithms,
  which we call tree-reweighted belief propagation, for efficiently computing the
  value of these upper bounds, as well as the associated pseudomarginals. We also
  consider the uses of our bounds for the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) parameter
  estimation. For a completely observed model, our analysis gives rise to a concave
  lower bound on the log likelihood of the data. Maximizing this lower bound yields
  an approximate ML estimate which, in analogy to the moment-matching of exact ML
  estimation, can be interpreted in terms of pseudo-moment-matching. We present preliminary
  results illustrating the behavior of this approximate ML estimator.
