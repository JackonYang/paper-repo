paperAbstract: Most connectionist research has focused on learning mappings from one
  space to another (eg. classification and regression). This paper introduces the
  more general task of learning constraint surfaces. It describes a simple but powerful
  architecture for learning and manipulating nonlinear surfaces from data. We demonstrate
  the technique on low dimensional synthetic surfaces and compare it to nearest neighbor
  approaches. We then show its utility in learning the space of lip images in a system
  for improving speech recognition by lip reading. This learned surface is used to
  improve the visual tracking performance during recognition.
