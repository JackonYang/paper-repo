paperAbstract: "The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing\
  \ correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints is studied.\
  \ A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal\
  \ regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties:\
  \ the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of\
  \ image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient\
  \ (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame\
  \ rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions,\
  \ the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure\
  \ for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures\
  \ that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant\
  \ constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and\
  \ hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences.\
  \ The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric\
  \ is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and\
  \ outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\xD7), illumination conditions,\
  \ out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation\
  \ of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar\
  \ geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below\
  \ 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."
