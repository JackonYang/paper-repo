paperAbstract: We present a novel mobile printed document retrieval system that utilizes
  both text and low bit-rate features. On the client phone, text are detected using
  an algorithm based on edge-enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Regions. The title
  text image patch is rectified using a gradient based algorithm and recognized using
  Optical Character Recognition. Low bit-rate image features are extracted from the
  query image. Both text and compressed features are sent to a server. On the server,
  the title text is used for on-line search and the features are used for image-based
  comparison. The proposed system is capable of web-scale document retrieval using
  title text without the need of constructing a document image database. Using features
  for image-based comparison, we can reliably match retrieved documents to the query
  document. Last, by using text and low bit-rate features, we can reduce the transmitted
  query size significantly.
