paperAbstract: 'In a traditional classification problem, we wish to assign one of
  k labels (or classes) to each of n objects, in a way that is consistent with some
  observed data that we have about the problem. An active line of research in this
  area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships
  among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations
  for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image
  processing, biometry: and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style
  of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting
  of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and
  separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two "related" objects.
  We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling
  problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification
  frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From
  the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial
  generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated
  quadratic assignment problem. We provide the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation
  algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main
  result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling
  problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary
  weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which
  the labels are endowed with the uniform metric-all distances are the same-our methods
  provide a 2-approximation.'
