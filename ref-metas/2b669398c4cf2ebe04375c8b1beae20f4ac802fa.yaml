paperAbstract: Unsupervised word representations are very useful in NLP tasks both
  as inputs to learning algorithms and as extra word features in NLP systems. However,
  most of these models are built with only local context and one representation per
  word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global context
  can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new
  neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture
  the semantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context,
  and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning multiple embeddings per word.
  We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential
  context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outperforms competitive
  baselines and other neural language models.
