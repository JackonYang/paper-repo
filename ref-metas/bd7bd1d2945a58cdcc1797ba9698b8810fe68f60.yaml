paperAbstract: We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set
  up as a Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation
  and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation
  to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous
  efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer)
  is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach
  Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem.
  We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information
  is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline.
  To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging
  task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends
  the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.
