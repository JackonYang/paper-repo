paperAbstract: Character segmentation has long been a critical area of the OCR process.
  The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words
  and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent
  progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more
  insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances.
  The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been
  developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under
  four main headings. What may be termed the "classical" approach consists of methods
  that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation
  of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called "dissection."
  The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly,
  by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets
  of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a
  hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules
  to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range
  of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic
  approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units
  are described.
