paperAbstract: The symbolic representation of gray-value variations is studied, with
  emphasis on the gradient of the image function. The goal is to relate the results
  of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics
  of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes
  of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient.
  Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed
  to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution
  kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization
  of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided.
  Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities
  for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes
  of the gray-value gradients are used. >
