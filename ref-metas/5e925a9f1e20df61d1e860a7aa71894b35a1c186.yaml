paperAbstract: Convolutional Neural Networks are extremely efficient architectures
  in image and audio recognition tasks, thanks to their ability to exploit the local
  translational invariance of signal classes over their domain. In this paper we consider
  possible generalizations of CNNs to signals defined on more general domains without
  the action of a translation group. In particular, we propose two constructions,
  one based upon a hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the
  spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that for low-dimensional
  graphs it is possible to learn convolutional layers with a number of parameters
  independent of the input size, resulting in efficient deep architectures.
