paperAbstract: 'We are interested in inferring object segmentation by leveraging only
  object class information, and by considering only minimal priors on the object segmentation
  task. This problem could be viewed as a kind of weakly supervised segmentation task,
  and naturally fits the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework: every training
  image is known to have (or not) at least one pixel corresponding to the image class
  label, and the segmentation task can be rewritten as inferring the pixels belonging
  to the class of the object (given one image, and its object class). We propose a
  Convolutional Neural Network-based model, which is constrained during training to
  put more weight on pixels which are important for classifying the image. We show
  that at test time, the model has learned to discriminate the right pixels well enough,
  such that it performs very well on an existing segmentation benchmark, by adding
  only few smoothing priors. Our system is trained using a subset of the Imagenet
  dataset and the segmentation experiments are performed on the challenging Pascal
  VOC dataset (with no fine-tuning of the model on Pascal VOC). Our model beats the
  state of the art results in weakly supervised object segmentation task by a large
  margin. We also compare the performance of our model with state of the art fully-supervised
  segmentation approaches.'
