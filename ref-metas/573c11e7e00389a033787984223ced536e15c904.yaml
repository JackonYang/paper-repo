paperAbstract: Non-rigid object detection and articulated pose estimation are two
  related and challenging problems in computer vision. Numerous models have been proposed
  over the years and often address different special cases, such as pedestrian detection
  or upper body pose estimation in TV footage. This paper shows that such specialization
  may not be necessary, and proposes a generic approach based on the pictorial structures
  framework. We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and
  spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of
  the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context
  descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret
  the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian
  relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system
  of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using
  belief propagation. We demonstrate that such a model is equally suitable for both
  detection and pose estimation tasks, outperforming the state of the art on three
  recently proposed datasets.
