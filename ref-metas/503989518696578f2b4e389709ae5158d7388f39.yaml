paperAbstract: Computational modules early in the human vision system typically generate
  sparse information about the shapes of visible surfaces in the scene. Moreover,
  visual processes such as stereopsis can provide such information at a number of
  levels spanning a range of resolutions. In this paper, we extend this multi-level
  structure to encompass the subsequent task of reconstructing full surface descriptions
  from the sparse information. The mathematical development proceeds in three steps.
  First, the surface most consistent with the sparse constraints is characterized
  as the solution to an equilibrium state of a thin flexible plate. Second, local,
  finite element representations of surfaces are introduced and, by applying the finite
  element method, the continuous variational principle is transformed into a discrete
  problem in the form of a large system of linear algebraic equations whose solution
  is computable by local-support, cooperative mechanisms. Third, to exploit the information
  available at each level of resolution, a hierarchy of discrete problems is formulated
  and a highly efficient multi-level algorithm, involving both intra-level relaxation
  processes and bi-directional inter-level algorithm, involving both intra- level
  relaxation processes and bidirectional inter-level local interpolation processes
  is applied to their simultaneous solution.. Examples of the generation of hierarchies
  of surface representations from stereo constraints are given. Finally, the basic
  surface approximation problem is revisited in a broader mathematical context whose
  implications are of relevance to vision.
