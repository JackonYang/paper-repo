paperAbstract: "We present an analysis of how the generalization performance (expected\
  \ test set error) relates to the expected training set error for nonlinear learning\
  \ systems, such as multilayer perceptrons and radial basis functions. The principal\
  \ result is the following relationship (computed to second order) between the expected\
  \ test set and training set errors: \u2329etest(\u03BB)\u232A\u03BE\u03BE\u2032\
  \ \u2248 \u2329etrain(\u03BB)\u232A\u03BE + 2\u03C3eff2 peff(\u03BB)/n (1) Here,\
  \ n is the size of the training sample \u03BE, \u03C3eff2 is the effective noise\
  \ variance in the response variable(s), \u03BB, is a regularization or weight decay\
  \ parameter, and Peff(\u03BB) is the effective number of parameters in the nonlinear\
  \ model. The expectations \u2329 \u232A of training set and test set errors are\
  \ taken over possible training sets \u03BE and training and test sets \u03BE\u2032\
  \ respectively. The effective number of parameters peff(\u03BB) usually differs\
  \ from the true number of model parameters p for nonlinear or regularized models;\
  \ this theoretical conclusion is supported by Monte Carlo experiments. In addition\
  \ to the surprising result that peff(\u03BB) \u2260 p, we propose an estimate of\
  \ (1) called the generalized prediction error (GPE) which generalizes well established\
  \ estimates of prediction risk such as Akaike's F P E and AIC, Mallows Cp, and Barron's\
  \ P S E to the nonlinear setting."
