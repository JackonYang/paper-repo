paperAbstract: "This thesis develops a mathematical basis for understanding the structure\
  \ of on-line handwritten documents and explores some of the related problems in\
  \ detail. With the increase in popularity of portable computing devices, such as\
  \ PDAs and handheld computers, non-keyboard based methods for data entry are receiving\
  \ more attention in the research communities and commercial sector. The most promising\
  \ options are pen-based and speech-based inputs. Pen-based input devices generate\
  \ handwritten documents which have on-line or dynamic (temporal) information encoded\
  \ in them. Digitizing devices like Smart-Boards and computing platforms, which use\
  \ pen-based input such as the IBM Thinkpad TransNote and Tablet PCs, create on-line\
  \ documents. As these devices become available and affordable, large volumes of\
  \ digital handwritten data will be generated and the problem of archiving and retrieving\
  \ such data becomes an important concern. This thesis addresses the problem of on-line\
  \ document understanding, which is an essential component of an effective retrieval\
  \ algorithm. \nThis thesis describes a mathematical model for representation of\
  \ on-line handwritten data based on the mechanics of the writing process. The representation\
  \ is used for extracting various properties of the handwritten data, which forms\
  \ the basis for understanding the higher level structure of a document. A principled\
  \ approach to the problem of document segmentation is presented using a parsing\
  \ technique based on stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). The parser generates\
  \ a segmentation of the handwritten page, which is optimal with respect to a proposed\
  \ compactness criterion. Additional properties of a region are identified based\
  \ on the nature and layout of handwritten strokes in the region. An algorithm to\
  \ identify ruled and unruled tables is presented. The thesis also proposes a set\
  \ of features for identification of scripts within the text regions and develops\
  \ an algorithm for script classification. \nThe thesis presents a matching algorithm,\
  \ which computes a similarity measure between the query and handwriting samples\
  \ in a database. The query and database samples could be either words or sketches,\
  \ which are automatically identified by the document segmentation algorithm. We\
  \ also address the related problem of document security, where on-line handwritten\
  \ signatures are used to watermark on-line and off-line documents. The use of a\
  \ biometric trait, such as signature, for watermarking allows the recipient of a\
  \ document to verify the identity of the author in addition to document integrity."
