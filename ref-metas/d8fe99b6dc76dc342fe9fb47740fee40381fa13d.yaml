paperAbstract: We describe a robust accurate domain-independent approach to statistical
  parsing incorporated into the new release of the ANLT toolkit, and publicly available
  as a research tool. The system has been used to parse many well known corpora in
  order to produce data for lexical acquisition efforts; it has also been used as
  a component in an open-domain question answering project. The performance of the
  system is competitive with that of statistical parsers using highly lexicalised
  parse selection models. However, we plan to extend the system to improve parse coverage,
  depth and accuracy.
