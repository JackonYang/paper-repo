paperAbstract: 'Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented
  as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common
  fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features
  have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore
  semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally
  distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that
  learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts,
  such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document
  by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction
  gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models.
  Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as
  well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art
  results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.'
