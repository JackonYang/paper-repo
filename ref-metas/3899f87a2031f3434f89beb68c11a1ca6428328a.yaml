paperAbstract: We present a novel end-to-end neural model to extract entities and
  relations between them. Our recurrent neural network based model captures both word
  sequence and dependency tree substructure information by stacking bidirectional
  tree-structured LSTM-RNNs on bidirectional sequential LSTM-RNNs. This allows our
  model to jointly represent both entities and relations with shared parameters in
  a single model. We further encourage detection of entities during training and use
  of entity information in relation extraction via entity pretraining and scheduled
  sampling. Our model improves over the state-of-the-art feature-based model on end-to-end
  relation extraction, achieving 12.1% and 5.7% relative error reductions in F1-score
  on ACE2005 and ACE2004, respectively. We also show that our LSTM-RNN based model
  compares favorably to the state-of-the-art CNN based model (in F1-score) on nominal
  relation classification (SemEval-2010 Task 8). Finally, we present an extensive
  ablation analysis of several model components.
