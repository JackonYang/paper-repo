paperAbstract: Theoretically I might say there were 327 brightnesses and nuances of
  colour. Do I have "327"? No. I have sky, house, and trees. It is impossible to achieve
  "327 " as such. And yet even though such droll calculation were possible and implied,
  say, for the house 120, the trees 90, the sky 117 -I should at least have this arrangement
  and division of the total, and not, say, 127 and 100 and 100; or 150 and 177.
