paperAbstract: 'In this paper we address the problem of matching two images with two
  different resolutions: a high-resolution image and a low-resolution one. On the
  premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes in scale,
  a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is produced. Hence the
  one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes one-to-many because the low-resolution
  image is compared with all the scale-space representations of the high-resolution
  one. Key to the success of such a process is the proper representation of the features
  to be matched in scale-space. We show how to extract interest points at variable
  scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two different
  resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and rotation-invariant
  descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution image onto a low-resolution
  image region, and an image matching strategy based on the robust estimation of this
  geometric model. Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used
  for scale changes up to a factor 6.'
