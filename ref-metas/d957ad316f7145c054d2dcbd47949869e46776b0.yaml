paperAbstract: We propose a novel method for unsupervised class segmentation on a
  set of images. It alternates between segmenting object instances and learning a
  class model. The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images
  at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in
  interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class
  model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this
  model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically
  determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build
  stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection.
  Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully
  automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific
  to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101,
  and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across
  images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently;
  (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers
  competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation
  and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2].
