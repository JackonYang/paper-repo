paperAbstract: The responses of visual cortical neurons during fixation tasks can
  be significantly modulated by stimuli from beyond the classical receptive field.
  Modulatory effects in neural responses have also been recently reported in a task
  where a monkey freely views a natural scene. In this article, we describe a hierarchical
  network model of visual recognition that explains these experimental observations
  by using a form of the extended Kalman filter as given by the minimum description
  length (MDL) principle. The model dynamically combines input-driven bottom-up signals
  with expectation-driven top-down signals to predict current recognition state. Synaptic
  weights in the model are adapted in a Hebbian manner according to a learning rule
  also derived from the MDL principle. The resulting prediction-learning scheme can
  be viewed as implementing a form of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
  The architecture of the model posits an active computational role for the reciprocal
  connections between adjoining visual cortical areas in determining neural response
  properties. In particular, the model demonstrates the possible role of feedback
  from higher cortical areas in mediating neurophysiological effects due to stimuli
  from beyond the classical receptive field. Simulations of the model are provided
  that help explain the experimental observations regarding neural responses in both
  free viewing and fixating conditions.
