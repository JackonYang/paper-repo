paperAbstract: We present an algorithm for learning a quadratic Gaussian metric (Mahalanobis
  distance) for use in classification tasks. Our method relies on the simple geometric
  intuition that a good metric is one under which points in the same class are simultaneously
  near each other and far from points in the other classes. We construct a convex
  optimization problem whose solution generates such a metric by trying to collapse
  all examples in the same class to a single point and push examples in other classes
  infinitely far away. We show that when the metric we learn is used in simple classifiers,
  it yields substantial improvements over standard alternatives on a variety of problems.
  We also discuss how the learned metric may be used to obtain a compact low dimensional
  feature representation of the original input space, allowing more efficient classification
  with very little reduction in performance.
