paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The relationship between ''learning'' in adaptive layered
  networks and the fitting of data with high dimensional surfaces is discussed. This
  leads naturally to a picture of ''generalization in terms of interpolation between
  known data points and suggests a rational approach to the theory of such networks.
  A class of adaptive networks is identified which makes the interpolation scheme
  explicit. This class has the property that learning is equivalent to the solution
  of a set of linear equations. These networks thus represent nonlinear relationships
  while having a guaranteed learning rule. Great Britain.'
