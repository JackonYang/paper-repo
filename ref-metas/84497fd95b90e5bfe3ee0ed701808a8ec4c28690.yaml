paperAbstract: We consider the problem of learning with instances defined over a space
  of sets of vectors. We derive a new positive definite kernel f(A,B) defined over
  pairs of matrices A,B based on the concept of principal angles between two linear
  subspaces. We show that the principal angles can be recovered using only inner-products
  between pairs of column vectors of the input matrices thereby allowing the original
  column vectors of A,B to be mapped onto arbitrarily high-dimensional feature spaces.We
  demonstrate the usage of the matrix-based kernel function f(A,B) with experiments
  on two visual tasks. The first task is the discrimination of "irregular" motion
  trajectory of an individual or a group of individuals in a video sequence. We use
  the SVM approach using f(A,B) where an input matrix represents the motion trajectory
  of a group of individuals over a certain (fixed) time frame. We show that the classification
  (irregular versus regular) greatly outperforms the conventional representation where
  all the trajectories form a single vector. The second application is the visual
  recognition of faces from input video sequences representing head motion and facial
  expressions where f(A,B) is used to compare two image sequences.
