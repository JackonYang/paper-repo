paperAbstract: 'Page segmentation and table detection play an important role in understanding
  the structure of documents. We present a page segmentation algorithm that incorporates
  state-of-the-art deep learning methods for segmenting three types of document elements:
  text blocks, tables, and figures. We propose a multi-scale, multi-task fully convolutional
  neural network (FCN) for the tasks of semantic page segmentation and element contour
  detection. The semantic segmentation network accurately predicts the probability
  at each pixel of the three element classes. The contour detection network accurately
  predicts instance level "edges" around each element occurrence. We propose a conditional
  random field (CRF) that uses features output from the semantic segmentation and
  contour networks to improve upon the semantic segmentation network output. Given
  the semantic segmentation output, we also extract individual table instances from
  the page using some heuristic rules and a verification network to remove false positives.
  We show that although we only consider a page image as input, we produce comparable
  results with other methods that relies on PDF file information and heuristics and
  hand crafted features tailored to specific types of documents. Our approach learns
  the representative features for page segmentation from real and synthetic training
  data. %, and produces good results on real documents. The learning-based property
  makes it a more general method than existing methods in terms of document types
  and element appearances. For example, our method reliably detects sparsely lined
  tables which are hard for rule-based or heuristic methods.'
