paperAbstract: 'This book offers a highly accessible introduction to natural language
  processing, the field that supports a variety of language technologies, from predictive
  text and email filtering to automatic summarization and translation. With it, you''ll
  learn how to write Python programs that work with large collections of unstructured
  text. You''ll access richly annotated datasets using a comprehensive range of linguistic
  data structures, and you''ll understand the main algorithms for analyzing the content
  and structure of written communication. Packed with examples and exercises, Natural
  Language Processing with Python will help you: Extract information from unstructured
  text, either to guess the topic or identify "named entities" Analyze linguistic
  structure in text, including parsing and semantic analysis Access popular linguistic
  databases, including WordNet and treebanks Integrate techniques drawn from fields
  as diverse as linguistics and artificial intelligence This book will help you gain
  practical skills in natural language processing using the Python programming language
  and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) open source library. If you''re interested
  in developing web applications, analyzing multilingual news sources, or documenting
  endangered languages -- or if you''re simply curious to have a programmer''s perspective
  on how human language works -- you''ll find Natural Language Processing with Python
  both fascinating and immensely useful.'
