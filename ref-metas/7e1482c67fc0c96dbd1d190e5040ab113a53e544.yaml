paperAbstract: An unsupervised developmental algorithm for linear maps is derived
  which reduces the pixel-entropy (using the measure introduced in previous work)
  at every update and thus removes pairwise correlations between pixels. Since the
  measure of pixel-entropy has only a global minimum the algorithm is guaranteed to
  converge to the minimum entropy map. Such optimal maps have recently been shown
  to possess cognitively desirable properties and are likely to be used by the nervous
  system to organize sensory information. The algorithm derived here turns out to
  be one proposed by Goodall for pairwise decorrelation. It is biologically plausible
  since in a neural network implementation it requires only data available locally
  to a neuron. In training over ensembles of two-dimensional input signals with the
  same spatial power spectrum as natural scenes, networks develop output neurons with
  center-surround receptive fields similar to those of ganglion cells in the retina.
  Some technical issues pertinent to developmental algorithms of this sort, such as
  symmetry fixing, are also discussed.
