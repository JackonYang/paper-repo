paperAbstract: Text is a very powerful index in content-based image and video indexing.
  We propose a new text detection and segmentation algorithm that is especially designed
  for being applied to color images with complicated background. Our goal is to minimize
  the number of false alarms and to binarize efficiently the detected text areas so
  that they can be processed by standard OCR software. First, potential areas of text
  are detected by enhancement and clustering processes, considering most of constraints
  related to the texture of words. Then, classification and binarization of potential
  text areas are achieved in a single scheme performing color quantization and characters
  periodicity analysis. We report a high rate of good detection results with very
  few false alarms and reliable text binarization.
