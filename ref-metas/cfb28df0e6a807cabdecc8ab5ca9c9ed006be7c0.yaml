paperAbstract: Visual object recognition is often conceived of as a final step in
  a visual processing system, First, physical information in the raw image is used
  to isolate and enhance to-be-recognized clumps and then each of the resulting preprocessed
  representations is fed into the recognizer. This general conception fails when there
  are no reliable physical cues for isolating the objects, such as when objects overlap.
  This paper describes an approach, called centered object integrated segmentation
  and recognition (COISR), for integrating object segmentation and recognition within
  a single neural network. The application is handprinted character recognition. The
  approach uses a backpropagation network that scans a field of characters and is
  trained to recognize whether it is centered over a single character or between characters.
  When it is centered over a character, the net classifies the character. The approach
  is tested on a dataset of handprinted digits and high accuracy rates are reported.
