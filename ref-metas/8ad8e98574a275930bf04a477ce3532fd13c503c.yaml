paperAbstract: We describe work toward the construction of a very wide-coverage probabilistic
  parsing system for natural language (NL), based on LR parsing techniques. The system
  is intended to rank the large number of syntactic analyses produced by NL grammars
  according to the frequency of occurrence of the individual rules deployed in each
  analysis. We discuss a fully automatic procedure for constructing an LR parse table
  from a unification-based grammar formalism, and consider the suitability of alternative
  LALR(1) parse table construction methods for large grammars. The parse table is
  used as the basis for two parsers; a user-driven interactive system that provides
  a computationally tractable and labor-efficient method of supervised training of
  the statistical information required to drive the probabilistic parser. The latter
  is constructed by associating probabilities with the LR parse table directly. This
  technique is superior to parsers based on probabilistic lexical tagging or probabilistic
  context-free grammar because it allows for a more context-dependent probabilistic
  language model, as well as use of a more linguistically adequate grammar formalism.
  We compare the performance of an optimized variant of Tomita's (1987) generalized
  LR parsing algorithm to an (efficiently indexed and optimized) chart parser. We
  report promising results of a pilot study training on 150 noun definitions from
  the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and retesting on these plus
  a further 55 definitions. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current system
  and possible extensions to deal with lexical (syntactic and semantic) frequency
  of occurrence.
