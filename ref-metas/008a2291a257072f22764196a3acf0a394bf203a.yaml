paperAbstract: Dividing sentences in chunks of words is a useful preprocessing step
  for parsing, information extraction and information retrieval. (Ramshaw and Marcus,
  1995) have introduced a "convenient" data representation for chunking by converting
  it to a tagging task. In this paper we will examine seven different data representations
  for the problem of recognizing noun phrase chunks. We will show that the the data
  representation choice has a minor influence on chunking performance. However, equipped
  with the most suitable data representation, our memory-based learning chunker was
  able to improve the best published chunking results for a standard data set.
