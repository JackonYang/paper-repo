paperAbstract: Computer vision applications have come to rely increasingly on superpixels
  in recent years, but it is not always clear what constitutes a good superpixel algorithm.
  In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically
  compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere
  to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation
  performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative
  clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate
  superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better
  than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient,
  improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel
  generation.
