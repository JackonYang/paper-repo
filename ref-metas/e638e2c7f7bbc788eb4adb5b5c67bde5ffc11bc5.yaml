paperAbstract: A probabilistic formulation for semantic image annotation and retrieval
  is proposed. Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where
  each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic
  label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between
  semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation
  and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally
  efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images.
  In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture
  density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated
  with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding
  semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument
  and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization.
  The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently
  popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated
  through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation
  is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at
  a fraction of their computational cost. Finally, the proposed method is shown to
  be fairly robust to parameter tuning
