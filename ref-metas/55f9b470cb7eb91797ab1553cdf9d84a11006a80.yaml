paperAbstract: Occlusion reasoning, necessary for tasks such as navigation and object
  search, is an important aspect of everyday life and a fundamental problem in computer
  vision. We believe that the amazing ability of humans to reason about occlusions
  from one image is based on an intrinsically 3D interpretation. In this paper, our
  goal is to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing
  structures in the scene. Our approach is to learn to identify and label occlusion
  boundaries using the traditional edge and region cues together with 3D surface and
  depth cues. Since some of these cues require good spatial support (i.e., a segmentation),
  we gradually create larger regions and use them to improve inference over the boundaries.
  Our experiments demonstrate the power of a scene-based approach to occlusion reasoning.
