paperAbstract: We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network"
  (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field.
  The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear
  activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with
  more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate
  the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function
  approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the
  input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN
  can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced
  local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling
  over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and
  less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated
  the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
  and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.
