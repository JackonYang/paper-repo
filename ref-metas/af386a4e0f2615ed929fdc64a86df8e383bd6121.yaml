paperAbstract: The problem of predicting the next word a speaker will say, given the
  words already spoken; is discussed. Specifically, the problem is to estimate the
  probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented
  for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these
  probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the
  words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over
  the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily
  complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed.
  Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict
  the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared
  to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >
