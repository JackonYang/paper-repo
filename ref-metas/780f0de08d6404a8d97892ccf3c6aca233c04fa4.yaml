paperAbstract: A formulation of a hierarchical page decomposition technique for technical
  journal pages using attribute grammars is presented. In this approach, block-grammars
  are recursively applied until a page is classified into its most significant sub-blocks.
  While a grammar devised for each block depends on its logical function, it is possible
  to formulate a generic description for all block grammars using attribute grammars.
  This attribute grammar formulation forms a generic framework on which this syntactic
  approach is based, while the attributes themselves are derived from publication-specific
  knowledge. The attribute extraction process and the formulation itself are covered
  in this paper. We discuss an application of attribute grammars to a document analysis
  problem, the extraction of logical, relational information from the image of tables.
