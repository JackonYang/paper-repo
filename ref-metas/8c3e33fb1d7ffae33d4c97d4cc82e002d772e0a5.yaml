paperAbstract: 'A statistical framework is used for finding boundaries and for partitioning
  scenes into homogeneous regions. The model is a joint probability distribution for
  the array of pixel gray levels and an array of labels. In boundary finding, the
  labels are binary, zero, or one, representing the absence or presence of boundary
  elements. In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same
  when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region.
  The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features
  of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric
  measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of
  model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned
  probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and
  partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation
  of these configurations. Stochastic relaxation methods are extended to accommodate
  constrained optimization. >'
