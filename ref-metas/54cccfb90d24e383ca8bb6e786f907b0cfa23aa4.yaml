paperAbstract: We address the problem of articulated human pose estimation in videos
  using an ensemble of tractable models with rich appearance, shape, contour and motion
  cues. In previous articulated pose estimation work on unconstrained videos, using
  temporal coupling of limb positions has made little to no difference in performance
  over parsing frames individually [8, 28]. One crucial reason for this is that joint
  parsing of multiple articulated parts over time involves intractable inference and
  learning problems, and previous work has resorted to approximate inference and simplified
  models. We overcome these computational and modeling limitations using an ensemble
  of tractable submodels which couple locations of body joints within and across frames
  using expressive cues. Each submodel is responsible for tracking a single joint
  through time (e.g., left elbow) and also models the spatial arrangement of all joints
  in a single frame. Because of the tree structure of each submodel, we can perform
  efficient exact inference and use rich temporal features that depend on image appearance,
  e.g., color tracking and optical flow contours. We propose and experimentally investigate
  a hierarchy of submodel combination methods, and we find that a highly efficient
  max-marginal combination method outperforms much slower (by orders of magnitude)
  approximate inference using dual decomposition. We apply our pose model on a new
  video dataset of highly varied and articulated poses from TV shows. We show significant
  quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art single-frame pose
  estimation approaches.
