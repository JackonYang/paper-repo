paperAbstract: 'A new efficient MRF optimization algorithm, called Fast-PD, is proposed,
  which generalizes a-expansion. One of its main advantages is that it offers a substantial
  speedup over that method, e.g. it can be at least 3-9 times faster than a-expansion.
  Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-PD exploits information coming
  not only from the original MRF problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore,
  besides static MRFs, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic
  MRFs, i.e. MRFs varying over time. On top of that, Fast-PD makes no compromise about
  the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as a-expansion,
  but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a
  much wider class of NP-hard MRF problems. Results on static and dynamic MRFs demonstrate
  the algorithm''s efficiency and power. E.g., Fast-PD has been able to compute disparity
  for stereoscopic sequences in real time, with the resulting disparity coinciding
  with that of a-expansion.'
