paperAbstract: We construct a nonlinear mapping from a high-dimensional sample space
  to a low-dimensional vector space, effectively recovering a Cartesian coordinate
  system for the manifold from which the data is sampled. The mapping preserves local
  geometric relations in the manifold and is pseudo-invertible. We show how to estimate
  the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold from samples, decompose the sample
  data into locally linear low-dimensional patches, merge these patches into a single
  low-dimensional coordinate system, and compute forward and reverse mappings between
  the sample and coordinate spaces. The objective functions are convex and their solutions
  are given in closed form.
