paperAbstract: This paper proposes a new isolated word recognition technique based
  on a combination of instantaneous and dynamic features of the speech spectrum. This
  technique is shown to be highly effective in speaker-independent speech recognition.
  Spoken utterances are represented by time sequences of cepstrum coefficients and
  energy. Regression coefficients for these time functions are extracted for every
  frame over an approximately 50 ms period. Time functions of regression coefficients
  extracted for cepstrum and energy are combined with time functions of the original
  cepstrum coefficients, and used with a staggered array DP matching algorithm to
  compare multiple templates and input speech. Speaker-independent isolated word recognition
  experiments using a vocabulary of 100 Japanese city names indicate that a recognition
  error rate of 2.4 percent can be obtained with this method. Using only the original
  cepstrum coefficients the error rate is 6.2 percent.
