paperAbstract: Texts in natural scenes carry rich semantic information, which can
  be used to assist a wide range of applications, such as object recognition, image/video
  retrieval, mapping/navigation, and human computer interaction. However, most existing
  systems are designed to detect and recognize horizontal (or near-horizontal) texts.
  Due to the increasing popularity of mobile-computing devices and applications, detecting
  texts of varying orientations from natural images under less controlled conditions
  has become an important but challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
  to detect texts of varying orientations. Our algorithm is based on a two-level classification
  scheme and two sets of features specially designed for capturing the intrinsic characteristics
  of texts. To better evaluate the proposed method and compare it with the competing
  algorithms, we generate a comprehensive dataset with various types of texts in diverse
  real-world scenes. We also propose a new evaluation protocol, which is more suitable
  for benchmarking algorithms for detecting texts in varying orientations. Experiments
  on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system compares favorably with the state-of-the-art
  algorithms when handling horizontal texts and achieves significantly enhanced performance
  on variant texts in complex natural scenes.
