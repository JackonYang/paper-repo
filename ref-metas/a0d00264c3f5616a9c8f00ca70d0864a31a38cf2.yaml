paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThis book presents a coherent approach to the\
  \ fast-moving field of computer vision, using a consistent notation based on a detailed\
  \ understanding of the image formation process. It covers even the most recent research\
  \ and will provide a useful and current reference for professionals working in the\
  \ fields of machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. \nAn outgrowth\
  \ of the author's course at MIT, Robot Vision presents a solid framework for understanding\
  \ existing work and planning future research. Its coverage includes a great deal\
  \ of material that is important to engineers applying machine vision methods in\
  \ the real world. The chapters on binary image processing, for example, help explain\
  \ and suggest how to improve the many commercial devices now available. And the\
  \ material on photometric stereo and the extended Gaussian image points the way\
  \ to what may be the next thrust in commercialization of the results in this area.\
  \ \nChapters in the first part of the book emphasize the development of simple symbolic\
  \ descriptions from images, while the remaining chapters deal with methods that\
  \ exploit these descriptions. The final chapter offers a detailed description of\
  \ how to integrate a vision system into an overall robotics system, in this case\
  \ one designed to pick parts out of a bin. \nThe many exercises complement and extend\
  \ the material in the text, and an extensive bibliography will serve as a useful\
  \ guide to current research. \nErrata (164k PDF)"
