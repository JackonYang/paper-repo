paperAbstract: A class of learning tasks is described that combines aspects of learning
  automation tasks and supervised learning pattern-classification tasks. These tasks
  are called associative reinforcement learning tasks. An algorithm is presented,
  called the associative reward-penalty, or AR-P algorithm for which a form of optimal
  performance is proved. This algorithm simultaneously generalizes a class of stochastic
  learning automata and a class of supervised learning pattern-classification methods
  related to the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation procedure. The relevance of
  this hybrid algorithm is discussed with respect to the collective behaviour of learning
  automata and the behaviour of networks of pattern-classifying adaptive elements.
  Simulation results are presented that illustrate the associative reinforcement learning
  task and the performance of the AR-P algorithm as compared with that of several
  existing algorithms.
