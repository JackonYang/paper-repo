paperAbstract: We describe the design and use of the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, an
  extensible pipeline that provides core natural language analysis. This toolkit is
  quite widely used, both in the research NLP community and also among commercial
  and government users of open source NLP technology. We suggest that this follows
  from a simple, approachable design, straightforward interfaces, the inclusion of
  robust and good quality analysis components, and not requiring use of a large amount
  of associated baggage.
