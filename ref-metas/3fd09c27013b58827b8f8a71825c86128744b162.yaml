paperAbstract: 'SUMMARY We discuss two classes of models for contingency tables, graphical
  and recursive models, both of which arise from restrictions that are expressible
  as conditional independencies of variable pairs. The first of these is a subclass
  of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected
  graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed
  graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint
  distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative
  models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory
  types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for
  detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency
  table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected
  or directed graph.'
