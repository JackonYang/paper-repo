paperAbstract: This work proposes a method to interpret a scene by assigning a semantic
  label at every pixel and inferring the spatial extent of individual object instances
  together with their occlusion relationships. Starting with an initial pixel labeling
  and a set of candidate object masks for a given test image, we select a subset of
  objects that explain the image well and have valid overlap relationships and occlusion
  ordering. This is done by minimizing an integer quadratic program either using a
  greedy method or a standard solver. Then we alternate between using the object predictions
  to refine the pixel labels and vice versa. The proposed system obtains promising
  results on two challenging subsets of the LabelMe and SUN datasets, the largest
  of which contains 45, 676 images and 232 classes.
