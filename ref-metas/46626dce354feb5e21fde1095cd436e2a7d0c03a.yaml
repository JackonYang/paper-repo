paperAbstract: Part-based tree-structured models have been widely used for 2D articulated
  human pose-estimation. These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while
  capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model.
  These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region
  resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence.
  Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that
  are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually
  lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence
  for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion.
  To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate
  the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode
  the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions
  between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model.
  We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm
  (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence
  of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively
  better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods.
