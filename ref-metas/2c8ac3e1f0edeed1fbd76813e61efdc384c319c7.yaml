paperAbstract: In order to respond correctly to a free form factual question given
  a large collection of texts, one needs to understand the question to a level that
  allows determining some of the constraints the question imposes on a possible answer.
  These constraints may include a semantic classification of the sought after answer
  and may even suggest using different strategies when looking for and verifying a
  candidate answer.This paper presents a machine learning approach to question classification.
  We learn a hierarchical classifier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy
  of answer types, and eventually classifies questions into fine-grained classes.
  We show accurate results on a large collection of free-form questions used in TREC
  10.
