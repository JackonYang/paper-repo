paperAbstract: We collected a corpus of parallel text in 11 languages from the proceedings
  of the European Parliament, which are published on the web. This corpus has found
  widespread use in the NLP community. Here, we focus on its acquisition and its application
  as training data for statistical machine translation (SMT). We trained SMT systems
  for 110 language pairs, which reveal interesting clues into the challenges ahead.
