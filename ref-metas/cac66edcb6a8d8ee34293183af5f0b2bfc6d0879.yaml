paperAbstract: Presents a novel block segmentation method for document images which
  can be applied to various document formats. Some documents have complicated column
  structures, in which some figure areas have no surrounding rectangles and others
  cut across text areas. In the approach presented, in order to segment documents
  into text and figure areas, the text areas are analyzed first, and the figure areas
  are then detected by analyzing information on the text areas. The overall process
  is as follows. First, character strings are merged into text groups by analyzing
  regularity in the text areas. Next, border lines of columns are detected by linking
  the edges of the text groups. After that, the whole page is segmented into small
  blocks according to the border lines. The blocks are then unified by using the column
  information, and some unified blocks are detected. Finally, a projection profile
  method is applied to the unified blocks in order to detect text areas and figure
  areas. This method was applied to 61 pages of Japanese technical papers and magazines,
  and 93.3% of the text areas and 93.2% of the figure areas were detected correctly.<<ETX>>
