paperAbstract: 1. The discharge frequency of simple neurones in the cat striate cortex
  responding to the two edges of a slit of light moving over their receptive fields
  was studied as a function of slit width. While one edge of the slit was discharging
  the cell, the other edge had a modifying influence on that discharge either by way
  of facilitation or of inhibition.
