paperAbstract: We present and analyze efficient algorithms for the automated recognition
  and interpretation of layout structures in electronic documents. The key idea is
  to use the patterns in the distribution of white space in a document to recognize
  and interpret its components. The recognition algorithm divides the document into
  a hierarchy of logical elements; the interpretation algorithms classify these divisions
  as base-text, tables, indented lists, polygonal drawings, and graphs. We present
  experimental data and discuss an information access application. Our methodology
  allows the automatic markup of documents\footnote{For instance in the SGML format}
  and the creation of multi-level indices and browsing tools for electronic libraries.
