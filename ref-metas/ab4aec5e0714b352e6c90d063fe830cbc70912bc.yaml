paperAbstract: 'Much of the progress in the fields constituting cognitive science
  has been based upon the use of explicit information processing models, almost exclusively
  patterned after conventional serial computers. An extension of these ideas to massively
  parallel, connectionist models appears to offer a number of advantages. After a
  preliminary discussion, this paper introduces a general connectionist model and
  considers how it might be used in cognitive science. Among the issues addressed
  are: stability and noise-sensitivity, distributed decision-making, time and sequence
  problems, and the representation of complex concepts.'
