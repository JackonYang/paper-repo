paperAbstract: 'This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the
  minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals)
  in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is
  the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of
  observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics
  together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The
  second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible
  sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution
  has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are
  addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately
  selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected
  by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information
  criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied
  to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME
  (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results
  are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between
  our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed.'
