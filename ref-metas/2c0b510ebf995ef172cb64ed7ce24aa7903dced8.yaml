paperAbstract: In this paper we study the problem of object detection for RGB-D images
  using semantically rich image and depth features. We propose a new geocentric embedding
  for depth images that encodes height above ground and angle with gravity for each
  pixel in addition to the horizontal disparity. We demonstrate that this geocentric
  embedding works better than using raw depth images for learning feature representations
  with convolutional neural networks. Our final object detection system achieves an
  average precision of 37.3%, which is a 56% relative improvement over existing methods.
  We then focus on the task of instance segmentation where we label pixels belonging
  to object instances found by our detector. For this task, we propose a decision
  forest approach that classifies pixels in the detection window as foreground or
  background using a family of unary and binary tests that query shape and geocentric
  pose features. Finally, we use the output from our object detectors in an existing
  superpixel classification framework for semantic scene segmentation and achieve
  a 24% relative improvement over current state-of-the-art for the object categories
  that we study. We believe advances such as those represented in this paper will
  facilitate the use of perception in fields like robotics.
