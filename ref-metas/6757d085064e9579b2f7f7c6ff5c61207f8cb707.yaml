paperAbstract: We address the problem of joint detection and segmentation of multiple
  object instances in an image, a key step towards scene understanding. Inspired by
  data-driven methods, we propose an exemplar-based approach to the task of instance
  segmentation, in which a set of reference image/shape masks is used to find multiple
  objects. We design a novel CRF framework that jointly models object appearance,
  shape deformation, and object occlusion. To tackle the challenging MAP inference
  problem, we derive an alternating procedure that interleaves object segmentation
  and shape/appearance adaptation. We evaluate our method on two datasets with instance
  labels and show promising results.
