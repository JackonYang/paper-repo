paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The problem of detecting intensity changes in images is
  canonical in vision. Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally
  estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria
  such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for.
  This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture
  as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational
  techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant
  operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error
  i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the
  marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability
  of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal
  operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in
  two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions
  is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and
  orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is
  discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)'
