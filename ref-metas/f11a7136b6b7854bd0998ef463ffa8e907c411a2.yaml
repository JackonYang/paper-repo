paperAbstract: Presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution
  approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local
  binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions.
  The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform,"
  are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram
  is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale
  and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform"
  patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution
  and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis.
  The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the
  operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the
  gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be
  realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental
  results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence
  statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.
