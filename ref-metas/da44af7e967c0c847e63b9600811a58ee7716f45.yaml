paperAbstract: "A method for analyzing the structure of the white background in document\
  \ images is described, along with applications to the problem of isolating blocks\
  \ of machine-printed text. The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms\
  \ for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification.\
  \ These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation,\
  \ in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are\
  \ isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis\
  \ of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles:\
  \ for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training\
  \ algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class\
  \ of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical\
  \ journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform\
  \ and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical\
  \ text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page\
  \ and text-line orientation."
