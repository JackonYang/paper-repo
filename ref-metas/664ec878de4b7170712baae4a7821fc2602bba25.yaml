paperAbstract: We explore the properties of byte-level recurrent language models.
  When given sufficient amounts of capacity, training data, and compute time, the
  representations learned by these models include disentangled features corresponding
  to high-level concepts. Specifically, we find a single unit which performs sentiment
  analysis. These representations, learned in an unsupervised manner, achieve state
  of the art on the binary subset of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. They are also
  very data efficient. When using only a handful of labeled examples, our approach
  matches the performance of strong baselines trained on full datasets. We also demonstrate
  the sentiment unit has a direct influence on the generative process of the model.
  Simply fixing its value to be positive or negative generates samples with the corresponding
  positive or negative sentiment.
