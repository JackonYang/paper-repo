paperAbstract: Unsupervised learning studies how systems can learn to represent particular
  input patterns in a way that reflects the statistical structure of the overall collection
  of input patterns. By contrast with SUPERVISED LEARNING or REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,
  there are no explicit target outputs or environmental evaluations associated with
  each input; rather the unsupervised learner brings to bear prior biases as to what
  aspects of the structure of the input should be captured in the output.
