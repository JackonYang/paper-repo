paperAbstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation have until
  recently been restricted to problems where the joint distribution of all variables
  has a density with respect to some fixed standard underlying measure. They have
  therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where
  the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes
  a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump
  between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely
  constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination
  problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point
  analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.
