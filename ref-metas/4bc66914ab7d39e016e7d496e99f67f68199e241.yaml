paperAbstract: An unsupervised learning algorithm that can obtain a probabilistic
  model of an object composed of a collection of parts (a moving human body in our
  examples) automatically from unlabeled training data is presented. The training
  data include both useful "foreground" features as well as features that arise from
  irrelevant background clutter - the correspondence between parts and detected features
  is unknown. The joint probability density function of the parts is represented by
  a mixture of decomposable triangulated graphs which allow for fast detection. To
  learn the model structure as well as model parameters, an EM-like algorithm is developed
  where the labeling of the data (part assignments) is treated as hidden variables.
  The unsupervised learning technique is not limited to decomposable triangulated
  graphs. The efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying
  it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled image sequences,
  and testing the learned models on a variety of sequences.
