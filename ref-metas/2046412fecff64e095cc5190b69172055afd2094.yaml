paperAbstract: Learning can be made more efficient if we can actively select particularly
  salient data points. Within a Bayesian learning framework, objective functions are
  discussed that measure the expected informativeness of candidate measurements. Three
  alternative specifications of what we want to gain information about lead to three
  different criteria for data selection. All these criteria depend on the assumption
  that the hypothesis space is correct, which may prove to be their main weakness.
