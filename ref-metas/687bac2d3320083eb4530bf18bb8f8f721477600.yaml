paperAbstract: Semantic word spaces have been very useful but cannot express the meaning
  of longer phrases in a principled way. Further progress towards understanding compositionality
  in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation
  resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce
  a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases
  in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment
  compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network.
  When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on
  several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative
  classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment
  labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features
  baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects
  of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative
  phrases.
