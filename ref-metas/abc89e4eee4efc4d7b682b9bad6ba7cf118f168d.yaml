paperAbstract: We describe a flexible form-reader system capable of extracting textual
  information from accounting documents, like invoices and bills of service companies.
  In this kind of document, the extraction of some information fields cannot take
  place without having detected the corresponding instruction fields, which are only
  constrained to range in given domains. We propose modeling the document's layout
  by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for
  form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields.
  This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms,
  based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with
  connectionist models. Experimental results are given in order to assess the actual
  performance of the system.
