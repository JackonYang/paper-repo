paperAbstract: We present a new machine learning framework called "self-taught learning"
  for using unlabeled data in supervised classification tasks. We do not assume that
  the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the
  labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or
  audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve
  performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled
  data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer
  learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical
  learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse
  coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features
  form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance.
  When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be
  learned for this representation.
