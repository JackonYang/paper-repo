paperAbstract: This paper describes a probabilistic object recognition technique which
  does not require correspondence matching of images. This technique is an extension
  of our earlier work (1996) on object recognition using matching of multi-dimensional
  receptive field histograms. In the earlier paper we have shown that multi-dimensional
  receptive field histograms can be matched to provide object recognition which is
  robust in the face of changes in viewing position and independent of image plane
  rotation and scale. In this paper we extend this method to compute the probability
  of the presence of an object in an image. The paper begins with a review of the
  method and previously presented experimental results. We then extend the method
  for histogram matching to obtain a genuine probability of the presence of an object.
  We present experimental results on a database of 100 objects showing that the approach
  is capable recognizing all objects correctly by using only a small portion of the
  image. Our results show that receptive field histograms provide a technique for
  object recognition which is robust, has low computational cost and a computational
  complexity which is linear with the number of pixels.
