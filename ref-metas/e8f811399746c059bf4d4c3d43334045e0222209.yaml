paperAbstract: In Sparse Coding (SC), input vectors are reconstructed using a sparse
  linear combination of basis vectors. SC has become a popular method for extracting
  features from data. For a given input, SC minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error
  with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications
  such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm
  that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute
  good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea
  is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a specific architecture and
  a fixed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version
  of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher's coordinate
  descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation
  than Li and Os-her's for the same approximation error. Unlike previous proposals
  for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate "explaining
  away" to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is differentiable
  and can be included into globally-trained recognition systems.
