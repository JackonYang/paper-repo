paperAbstract: This paper presents the task on the evaluation of Compositional Distributional
  Semantics Models on full sentences organized for the first time within SemEval2014.
  Participation was open to systems based on any approach. Systems were presented
  with pairs of sentences and were evaluated on their ability to predict human judgments
  on (i) semantic relatedness and (ii) entailment. The task attracted 21 teams, most
  of which participated in both subtasks. We received 17 submissions in the relatedness
  subtask (for a total of 66 runs) and 18 in the entailment subtask (65 runs).
