paperAbstract: We propose an optimality principle for training an unsupervised feedforward
  neural network based upon maximal ability to reconstruct the input data from the
  network outputs. We describe an algorithm which can be used to train either linear
  or nonlinear networks with certain types of nonlinearity. Examples of applications
  to the problems of image coding, feature detection, and analysis of random-dot stereograms
  are presented.
