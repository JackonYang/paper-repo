paperAbstract: We present a two-layer hierarchical formulation to exploit different
  levels of contextual information in images for robust classification. Each layer
  is modeled as a conditional field that allows one to capture arbitrary observation-dependent
  label interactions. The proposed framework has two main advantages. First, it encodes
  both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the
  long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in
  a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different
  domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The
  parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation.
  The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets
  and comparison results are presented
