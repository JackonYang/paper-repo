paperAbstract: When a trigram backoff language model is created from a large body
  of text, trigrams and bigrams that occur few times in the training text are often
  excluded from the model in order to decrease the model size. Generally, the elimination
  of n-grams with very low counts is believed to not significantly affect model performance.
  This project investigates the degradation of a trigram backoff model's perplexity
  and word error rates as bigram and trigram cutoffs are increased. The advantage
  of reduction in model size is compared to the increase in word error rate and perplexity
  scores. More importantly, this project also investigates alternative ways of excluding
  bigrams and trigrams from a backoff language model, using criteria other than the
  number of times an n-gram occurs in the training text. Specifically, a difference
  method has been investigated where the difference in the logs of the original and
  backed off trigram and bigram probabilities is used as a basis for n-gram exclusion
  from the model. We show that excluding trigrams and bigrams based on a weighted
  version of this difference method results in better perplexity and word error rate
  performance than excluding trigrams and bigrams based on counts alone.
