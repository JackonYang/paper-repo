paperAbstract: User-provided object bounding box is a simple and popular interaction
  paradigm considered by many existing interactive image segmentation frameworks.
  However, these frameworks tend to exploit the provided bounding box merely to exclude
  its exterior from consideration and sometimes to initialize the energy minimization.
  In this paper, we discuss how the bounding box can be further used to impose a powerful
  topological prior, which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures
  that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way.
  The prior is expressed using hard constraints incorporated into the global energy
  minimization framework leading to an NP-hard integer program. We then investigate
  the possible optimization strategies including linear relaxation as well as a new
  graph cut algorithm called pinpointing. The latter can be used either as a rounding
  method for the fractional LP solution, which is provably better than thresholding-based
  rounding, or as a fast standalone heuristic. We evaluate the proposed algorithms
  on a publicly available dataset, and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new
  prior both qualitatively and quantitatively.
