paperAbstract: We present a new approach to texture analysis based on the spatial
  distribution of local features in unsegmented textures. The textures are described
  using features derived from generalized co-occurrence matrices (GCM). A GCM is determined
  by a spatial constraint predicate F and a set of local features P = {(Xi, Yi, di),
  i = 1,..., m} where (Xi, Yi) is the location of the ith feature, and di is a description
  of the ith feature. The GCM of P under F, GF, is defined by GF(i, j) = number of
  pairs, pk, pl such that F(pk, pl) is true and di and dj are the descriptions of
  pk and pl, respectively. We discuss features derived from GCM's and present an experimental
  study using natural textures.
