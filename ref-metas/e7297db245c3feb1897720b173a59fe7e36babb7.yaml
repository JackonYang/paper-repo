paperAbstract: 'We have used information-theoretic ideas to derive a class of practical
  and nearly optimal schemes for adapting the size of a neural network. By removing
  unimportant weights from a network, several improvements can be expected: better
  generalization, fewer training examples required, and improved speed of learning
  and/or classification. The basic idea is to use second-derivative information to
  make a tradeoff between network complexity and training set error. Experiments confirm
  the usefulness of the methods on a real-world application.'
