paperAbstract: We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional
  Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor
  pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures
  achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object classification (NORB,
  CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53%, 19.51%,
  0.35%, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better
  than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained
  within five epochs. Test error rates on MNIST drop to 2.42%, 0.97% and 0.48% after
  1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.
