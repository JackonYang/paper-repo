paperAbstract: We propose a technique for automatically learning layers of "flexible
  sprites" (probabilistic 2-dimensional appearance maps and masks of moving, occluding
  objects). The model explains each input image as a layered composition of flexible
  sprites. A variational expectation maximization algorithm is used to learn a mixture
  of sprites from a video sequence. For each input image, probabilistic inference
  is used to infer the sprite class, translation, mask values and pixel intensities
  (including obstructed pixels) in each layer. Exact inference is intractable, but
  we show how a variational inference technique can be used to process 320/spl times/240
  images at 1 frame/second. The only inputs to the learning algorithm are the video
  sequence, the number of layers and the number of flexible sprites. We give results
  on several tasks, including summarizing a video sequence with sprites, point-and-click
  video stabilization, and point-and-click object removal.
