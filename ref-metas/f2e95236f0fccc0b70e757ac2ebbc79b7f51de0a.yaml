paperAbstract: We show how to use unlabeled data and a deep belief net (DBN) to learn
  a good covariance kernel for a Gaussian process. We first learn a deep generative
  model of the unlabeled data using the fast, greedy algorithm introduced by [7].
  If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied
  to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel
  applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classification can
  then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively
  fine-tune the covariance kernel.
