paperAbstract: We propose a new deterministic approach to coreference resolution that
  combines the global information and precise features of modern machine-learning
  models with the transparency and modularity of deterministic, rule-based systems.
  Our sieve architecture applies a battery of deterministic coreference models one
  at a time from highest to lowest precision, where each model builds on the previous
  model's cluster output. The two stages of our sieve-based architecture, a mention
  detection stage that heavily favors recall, followed by coreference sieves that
  are precision-oriented, offer a powerful way to achieve both high precision and
  high recall. Further, our approach makes use of global information through an entity-centric
  model that encourages the sharing of features across all mentions that point to
  the same real-world entity. Despite its simplicity, our approach gives state-of-the-art
  performance on several corpora and genres, and has also been incorporated into hybrid
  state-of-the-art coreference systems for Chinese and Arabic. Our system thus offers
  a new paradigm for combining knowledge in rule-based systems that has implications
  throughout computational linguistics.
