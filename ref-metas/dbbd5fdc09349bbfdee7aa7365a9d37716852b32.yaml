paperAbstract: This paper tackles the problem of recognizing characters in images
  of natural scenes. In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations
  that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated
  database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises
  of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The
  problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words
  representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour
  and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed
  method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial
  OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training
  data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation.
