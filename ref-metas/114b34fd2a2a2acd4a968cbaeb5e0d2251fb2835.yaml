paperAbstract: In this paper we present a framework for pixel-wise object segmentation
  of road scenes that combines motion and appearance features. It is designed to handle
  street-level imagery such as that on Google Street View and Microsoft Bing Maps.
  We formulate the problem in a CRF framework in order to probabilistically model
  the label likelihoods and the a priori knowledge. An extended set of appearance-based
  features is used, which consists of textons, colour, location and HOG descriptors.
  A novel boosting approach is then applied to combine the motion and appearance-based
  features. We also incorporate higher order potentials in our CRF model, which produce
  segmentations with precise object boundaries. We evaluate our method both quantitatively
  and qualitatively on the challenging Cambridge-driving Labeled Video dataset. Our
  approach shows an overall recognition accuracy of 84% compared to the state-of-the-art
  accuracy of 69%.
