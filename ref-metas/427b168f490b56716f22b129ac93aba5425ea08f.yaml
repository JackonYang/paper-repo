paperAbstract: Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become one of the most prominent
  machine learning techniques for high-dimensional sparse data commonly encountered
  in applications like text classification, word-sense disambiguation, and drug design.
  These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number
  of features N, while each example has only s << N non-zero features. This paper
  presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training
  time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression
  problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of
  the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several
  orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets.
