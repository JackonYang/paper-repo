paperAbstract: The goal of our work is object categorization in real-world scenes.
  That is, given a novel image we want to recognize and localize unseen-before objects
  based on their similarity to a learned object category. For use in a real-world
  system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple
  scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization
  using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The
  approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve
  excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales.
  We present an experimental comparison of the influence of different interest point
  operators and quantitatively show the method's robustness to large scale changes.
