paperAbstract: A new method for performing a nonlinear form of Principal Component
  Analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can
  efficiently compute principal components in highdimensional feature spaces, related
  to input space by some nonlinear map; for instance the space of all possible d-pixel
  products in images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental
  results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.
