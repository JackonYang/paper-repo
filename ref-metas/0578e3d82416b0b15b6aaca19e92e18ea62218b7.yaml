paperAbstract: New techniques are described for model-based recognition of the objects
  in 3-D space. The recognition is performed from single gray-scale images taken from
  unknown viewpoints. The objects in the scene may be overlapping and partially occluded.
  An efficient matching algorithm, which assumes affine approximation to the prospective
  viewing transformation, is proposed. The algorithm has an offline model preprocessing
  (shape representation) phase which is independent of the scene information and a
  recognition phase based on efficient indexing. It has a straightforward parallel
  implementation. The algorithm was successfully tested in recognition of industrial
  objects appearing in composite occluded scenes. >
