paperAbstract: "In this paper we present several of the salient theoretical and practical\
  \ issues associated with modeling a speech signal as a probabilistic function of\
  \ a (hidden) Markov chain. First we give a concise review of the literature with\
  \ emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion\
  \ of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch\
  \ algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis\
  \ on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial\
  \ but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov\
  \ models, which we call \u201Cleft-to-right\u201D models. This class of models is\
  \ especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application\
  \ of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment\
  \ are given in a companion paper."
