paperAbstract: Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally
  expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of
  the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the
  distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases
  to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input
  to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time
  in feedforward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent
  on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural
  networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization
  by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed
  inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization,
  we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after
  the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer
  normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times.
  It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the
  normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very
  effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically,
  we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared
  with previously published techniques.
