paperAbstract: Over the last years significant efforts have been made to develop kernels
  that can be applied to sequence data such as DNA, text, speech, video and images.
  The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine
  an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classifiers
  such as SVM's. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel
  for systematically finding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length
  sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and
  images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known
  probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian
  models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
  between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative
  and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments
  on speaker identification/verification and image classification tasks and show that
  these new kernels have the best performance in speaker verification and mostly outperform
  the Fisher kernel based SVM's and the generative classifiers in speaker identification
  and image classification.
