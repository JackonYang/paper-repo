paperAbstract: To create a pose-invariant face recognizer, one strategy is the view-based
  approach, which uses a set of real example views at different poses. But what if
  we only have one real view available, such as a scanned passport photo-can we still
  recognize faces under different poses? Given one real view at a known pose, it is
  still possible to use the view-based approach by exploiting prior knowledge of faces
  to generate virtual views, or views of the face as seen from different poses. To
  represent prior knowledge, we use 2D example views of prototype faces under different
  rotations. We develop example-based techniques for applying the rotation seen in
  the prototypes to essentially "rotate" the single real view which is available.
  Next, the combined set of one real and multiple virtual views is used as example
  views for a view-based, pose-invariant face recognizer. Oar experiments suggest
  that among the techniques for expressing prior knowledge of faces, 2D example-based
  approaches should be considered alongside the more standard 3D modeling techniques.<<ETX>>
