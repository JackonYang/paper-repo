paperAbstract: The amount of readily available on-line text has reached hundreds of
  billions of words and continues to grow. Yet for most core natural language tasks,
  algorithms continue to be optimized, tested and compared after training on corpora
  consisting of only one million words or less. In this paper, we evaluate the performance
  of different learning methods on a prototypical natural language disambiguation
  task, confusion set disambiguation, when trained on orders of magnitude more labeled
  data than has previously been used. We are fortunate that for this particular application,
  correctly labeled training data is free. Since this will often not be the case,
  we examine methods for effectively exploiting very large corpora when labeled data
  comes at a cost.
