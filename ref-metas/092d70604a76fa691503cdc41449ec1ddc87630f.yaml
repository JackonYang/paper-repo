paperAbstract: The statistics of photographic images, when represented using multiscale
  (wavelet) bases, exhibit two striking types of non-Gaussian behavior. First, the
  marginal densities of the coefficients have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint
  densities exhibit variance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We
  examine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show that these
  densities can accurately characterize both the marginal and joint distributions
  of natural image wavelet coefficients. This class of model suggests a Markov structure,
  in which wavelet coefficients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding
  to local image structure. We derive an estimator for these hidden variables, and
  show that a nonlinear "normalization" procedure can be used to Gaussianize the coefficients.
