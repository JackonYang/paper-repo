paperAbstract: We present an approach for learning to detect objects in still gray
  images, that is based on a sparse, part-based representation of objects. A vocabulary
  of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample
  images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts
  from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on
  this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to
  detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to
  any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration.
  We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that
  the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world
  images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition,
  we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant
  for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches.
