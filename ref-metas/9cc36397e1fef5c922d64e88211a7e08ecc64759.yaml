paperAbstract: In many supervised learning tasks, the entities to be labeled are related
  to each other in complex ways and their labels are not independent. For example,
  in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. A
  standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations
  between them. Recently, Probabilistic Relational Models, a relational version of
  Bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection
  of related entities. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds
  on (conditional) Markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach.
  First, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation
  of many important relational dependencies in directed models. Second, undirected
  models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional
  likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification
  accuracy. We show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate
  probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of
  multiple related entities. We provide experimental results on a webpage classification
  task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational
  dependencies.
