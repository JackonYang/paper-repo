paperAbstract: "The scale problem is common to most tasks involving analysis of image\
  \ data\u2014in general situations it is hardly ever possible to know in advance\
  \ at what scales interesting structures can be expected to appear. Size variations\
  \ of image structures can occur for several reasons, e.g. because the world contains\
  \ objects of different physical size, because surface textures contain structures\
  \ at different scales, and because of perspective effects and noise in the image\
  \ formation process. A proper representation of scale is essential to most visual\
  \ tasks requiring stable descriptors of image structure. In certain problems, such\
  \ as shape-from-texture, scale variations in an image also constitute a primary\
  \ cue in its own right."
