paperAbstract: Most recent research in trainable part of speech taggers has explored
  stochastic tagging. While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information
  is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual
  probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that
  obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant
  linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this
  paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe
  a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are
  currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown
  words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where
  multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty.
