paperAbstract: "Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing,\
  \ sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability\
  \ to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales,\
  \ owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning\
  \ model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural\
  \ network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to\
  \ the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer,\
  \ it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but,\
  \ like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised\
  \ learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions\
  \ designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show\
  \ that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points\
  \ and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize\
  \ these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When\
  \ trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle\
  \ in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together,\
  \ our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured\
  \ tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read\u2013write\
  \ memory."
