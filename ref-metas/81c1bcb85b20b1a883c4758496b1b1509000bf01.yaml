paperAbstract: A new framework is presented that uses tools from duality theory of
  linear programming to derive graph-cut based combinatorial algorithms for approximating
  NP-hard classification problems. The derived algorithms include alpha-expansion
  graph cut techniques merely as a special case, have guaranteed optimality properties
  even in cases where alpha-expansion techniques fail to do so and can provide very
  tight per-instance suboptimality bounds in all occasions
