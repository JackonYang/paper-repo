paperAbstract: The past few years have seen a growing interest in the application"
  of three-dimensional image processing. With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial
  information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9],
  aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance
  of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is
  to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling
  systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing
  It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be
  fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting
  edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest
  neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions
  on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences
  determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the
  two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used
  for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by
  the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity
  map of the scene viewed.
