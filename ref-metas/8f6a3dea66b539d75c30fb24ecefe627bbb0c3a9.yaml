paperAbstract: This paper demonstrates a new visual motion estimation technique that
  is able to recover high degree-of-freedom articulated human body configurations
  in complex video sequences. We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique,
  the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential
  motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us
  to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded
  configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated
  full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D
  human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of
  Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging
  footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy.
