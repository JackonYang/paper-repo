paperAbstract: "Segmentation of range images has long been considered in computer\
  \ vision as an important but extremely difficult problem. In this paper we present\
  \ a new paradigm for the segmentation of range images into piecewise continuous\
  \ surfaces. Data aggregation is performed via model recovery in terms of variable-order\
  \ bi-variate polynomials using iterative regression. Model recovery is initiated\
  \ independently in regularly placed seed regions in the image. All the recovered\
  \ models are potential candidates for the final description of the data. Selection\
  \ of the models is defined as a quadratic Boolean problem, and the solution is sought\
  \ by the WTA (winner-takes-all) technique, which turns out to be a good compromise\
  \ between the speed of computation and the accuracy of the solution. The overall\
  \ efficiency of the method is achieved by combining model recovery and model selection\
  \ in an iterative way. Partial recovery of the models is followed by the selection\
  \ (optimization) procedure and only the \u201Cbest\u201D models are allowed to develop\
  \ further.The major novelty of the approach lies in an effective combination of\
  \ simple component algorithms, which stands in contrast to methods which attempt\
  \ to solve the problem in a single processing step using sophisticated means. We\
  \ present the results on several real range images."
