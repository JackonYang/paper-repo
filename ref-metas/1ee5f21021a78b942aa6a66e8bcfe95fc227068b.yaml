paperAbstract: 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated promising performance
  in single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN best copes with multi-label
  images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex underlying object
  layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. In this work, we propose a
  flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an
  arbitrary number of object segment hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared
  CNN is connected with each hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different
  hypotheses are aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions.
  Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include: 1)
  no ground-truth bounding box information is required for training; 2) the whole
  HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant hypotheses; 3) no
  explicit hypothesis label is required; 4) the shared CNN may be well pre-trained
  with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g. ImageNet; and 5) it may naturally
  output multi-label prediction results. Experimental results on Pascal VOC2007 and
  VOC2012 multi-label image datasets well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
  HCP infrastructure over other state-of-the-arts. In particular, the mAP reaches
  84.2% by HCP only and 90.3% after the fusion with our complementary result in [47]
  based on hand-crafted features on the VOC2012 dataset, which significantly outperforms
  the state-of-the-arts with a large margin of more than 7%.'
