paperAbstract: "THE PRESENT PAPER describes some observations upon the modality and\
  \ topographical attributes of single neurons of the first somatic sensory area of\
  \ the cat\u2019s cerebral cortex, the analogue of the cortex of the postcentral\
  \ gyrus in the primate brain. These data, together with others upon the response\
  \ latencies of the cells of different layers of the cortex to peripheral stimuli,\
  \ support an hypothesis of the functional organization of this cortical area. This\
  \ is that the neurons which lie in narrow vertical columns, or cylinders, extending\
  \ from layer II through layer VI make up an elementary unit of organization, for\
  \ they are activated by stimulation of the same single class of peripheral receptors,\
  \ from almost identical peripheral receptive fields, at latencies ers. It is early\
  \ These which are not significantly different for the cells of the various layemphasized\
  \ that this pattern of organization obtains only for the repetitiv neurons \u2018\
  e responses may be rela of ted cortical in quite neurons different to brief peripheral\
  \ stimuli. organization patterns when analyzed in terms of later discharges. A report\
  \ of these experiments was made to the American Physiological Society in September,\
  \ 1955 (10, 17)."
