paperAbstract: 'We present a new learning architecture: the Decision Directed Acyclic
  Graph (DDAG), which is used to combine many two-class classifiers into a multiclass
  classifier. For an N-class problem, the DDAG contains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, one
  for each pair of classes. We present a VC analysis of the case when the node classifiers
  are hyperplanes; the resulting bound on the test error depends on N and on the margin
  achieved at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. This motivates an
  algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class
  maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision-node of the DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially
  faster to train and evaluate than either the standard algorithm or Max Wins, while
  maintaining comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms.'
