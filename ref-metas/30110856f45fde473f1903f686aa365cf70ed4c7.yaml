paperAbstract: This work describes an approach for inferring De-terministic Context-free
  (DCF) Grammars in a Connectionist paradigm using a Recurrent Neu-ral Network Pushdown
  Automaton (NNPDA). The NNPDA consists of a recurrent neural network connected to
  an external stack memory through a common error function. We show that the NNPDA
  is able to learn the dynamics of an underlying push-down automaton from examples
  of grammatical and non-grammatical strings. Not only does the network learn the
  state transitions in the automaton , it also learns the actions required to control
  the stack. In order to use continuous optimization methods, we develop an analog
  stack which reverts to a discrete stack by quantization of all activations, after
  the network has learned the transition rules and stack actions. We further show
  an enhancement of the network's learning capabilities by providing hints. In addition,
  an initial comparative study of simulations with rst, second and third order recurrent
  networks has shown that the increased degree of freedom in a higher order networks
  improve generalization but not necessarily learning speed.
