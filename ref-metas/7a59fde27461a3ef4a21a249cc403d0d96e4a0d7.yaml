paperAbstract: To accelerate the training of kernel machines, we propose to map the
  input data to a randomized low-dimensional feature space and then apply existing
  fast linear methods. The features are designed so that the inner products of the
  transformed data are approximately equal to those in the feature space of a user
  specified shift-invariant kernel. We explore two sets of random features, provide
  convergence bounds on their ability to approximate various radial basis kernels,
  and show that in large-scale classification and regression tasks linear machine
  learning algorithms applied to these features outperform state-of-the-art large-scale
  kernel machines.
