paperAbstract: The ability to accurately model a sentence at varying stages (e.g.,
  word-phrase-sentence) plays a central role in natural language processing. As an
  effort towards this goal we propose a self-adaptive hierarchical sentence model
  (AdaSent). AdaSent effectively forms a hierarchy of representations from words to
  phrases and then to sentences through recursive gated local composition of adjacent
  segments. We design a competitive mechanism (through gating networks) to allow the
  representations of the same sentence to be engaged in a particular learning task
  (e.g., classification), therefore effectively mitigating the gradient vanishing
  problem persistent in other recursive models. Both qualitative and quantitative
  analysis shows that AdaSent can automatically form and select the representations
  suitable for the task at hand during training, yielding superior classification
  performance over competitor models on 5 benchmark data sets.
