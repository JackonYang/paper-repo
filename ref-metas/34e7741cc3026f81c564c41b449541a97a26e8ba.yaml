paperAbstract: 'The paper presents contributions to the design of the Flock of Trackers
  (FoT). The FoT estimates the pose of the tracked object by robustly combining displacement
  estimates from a subset of local trackers that cover the object and has been. The
  enhancements of the Flock of Trackers are: (i) new reliability predictors for the
  local trackers - the Neighbourhood consistency predictor and the Markov predictor,
  (ii) new rules for combining the predictions and (iii) introduction of a RANSAC-based
  estimator of object motion. The enhanced FoT was extensively tested on 62 sequences.Most
  of the sequences are standard and used in the literature. The improved FoT showed
  performance superior to the reference method. For all 62 sequences, the ground truth
  is made publicly available.'
