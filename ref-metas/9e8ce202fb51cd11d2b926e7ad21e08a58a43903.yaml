paperAbstract: Edge detection is a critical component of many vision systems, including
  object detectors and image segmentation algorithms. Patches of edges exhibit well-known
  forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we
  take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an
  accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of
  predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random
  decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the
  structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures
  may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains real time performance that
  is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while
  also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation
  dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as
  a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well
  across datasets.
