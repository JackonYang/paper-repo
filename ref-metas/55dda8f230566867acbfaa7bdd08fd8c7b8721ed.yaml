paperAbstract: 'Convolutional networks almost always incorporate some form of spatial
  pooling, and very often it is max-pooling with = 2. Max-pooling act on the hidden
  layers of the network, reducing their size by an integer multiplicative factor .
  The amazing by product of discarding 75% of your data is that you build into the
  network a degree of invariance with respect to translations and elastic distortions.
  However, if you simply alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance
  is limited due to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of
  the pooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of max-pooling where
  is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of maxpooling is stochastic as
  there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling regions. We find
  that our form of fractional max-pooling reduces overfitting on a variety of datasets:
  for instance, we improve on the state of the art for CIFAR-100 without even using
  dropout.'
