paperAbstract: "The projection of cells in different layers of several cortical visual\
  \ areas in the cat were studied using the method of retrograde transport of horseradish\
  \ peroxidase. Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette,\
  \ making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We\
  \ found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a\
  \ distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus.\
  \ Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico\u2010\
  cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual\
  \ area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate,\
  \ cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion\
  \ of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer:\
  \ apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior\
  \ colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral\
  \ geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II\
  \ and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable\
  \ specificity in the projections of the cortical layers."
