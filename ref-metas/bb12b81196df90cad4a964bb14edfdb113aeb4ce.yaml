paperAbstract: "We present a unified model for face detection, pose estimation, and\
  \ landmark estimation in real-world, cluttered images. Our model is based on a mixtures\
  \ of trees with a shared pool of parts; we model every facial landmark as a part\
  \ and use global mixtures to capture topological changes due to viewpoint. We show\
  \ that tree-structured models are surprisingly effective at capturing global elastic\
  \ deformation, while being easy to optimize unlike dense graph structures. We present\
  \ extensive results on standard face benchmarks, as well as a new \u201Cin the wild\u201D\
  \ annotated dataset, that suggests our system advances the state-of-the-art, sometimes\
  \ considerably, for all three tasks. Though our model is modestly trained with hundreds\
  \ of faces, it compares favorably to commercial systems trained with billions of\
  \ examples (such as Google Picasa and face.com)."
