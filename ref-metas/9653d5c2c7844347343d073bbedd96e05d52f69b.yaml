paperAbstract: We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability
  of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions
  in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches
  such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number
  of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input,
  which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various
  combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem
  of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural
  attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using
  attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder
  step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as
  the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets
  can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems
  - finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar
  Travelling Salesman Problem - using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve
  over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize
  to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize
  beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks
  will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.
