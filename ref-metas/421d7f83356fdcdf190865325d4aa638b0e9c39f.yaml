paperAbstract: "This chapter introduces the subject of statistical pattern recognition\
  \ (SPR). It starts by considering how features are defined and emphasizes that the\
  \ nearest neighbor algorithm achieves error rates comparable with those of an ideal\
  \ Bayes\u2019 classifier. The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness\
  \ of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are\
  \ stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and\
  \ artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although\
  \ each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture\
  \ and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between\
  \ supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter\
  \ and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit\
  \ into the SPR framework. The chapter also defines the receiver operating characteristic,\
  \ which allows an optimum balance between false positives and false negatives to\
  \ be achieved."
