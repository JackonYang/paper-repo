paperAbstract: 'Abstract : This reprint will introduce and study the most basic properties
  of three new variational problems which are suggested by applications to computer
  vision. In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose
  the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing
  the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world
  is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the
  intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction
  rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases
  a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the
  strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y)
  is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given
  by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain
  R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the
  surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain
  R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another
  object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the
  sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the ''edge''
  of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y)
  to be discontinuous along this boundary. (JHD)'
