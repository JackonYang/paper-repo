paperAbstract: "This paper proposes a new technique for binalizing multicolored characters\
  \ subject to heavy degradations. The key ideas are threefold. The first is generation\
  \ of tentatively binarized images via every dichotomization of k clusters obtained\
  \ by k-means clustering in the HSI color space. The total number of tentatively\
  \ binarized images equals 2^k\u22122. The second is use of support vector machines\
  \ (SVM) to determine whether and to what degree each tentatively binarized image\
  \ represents a character or non-character. We feed the SVM with mesh and weighted\
  \ direction code histogram features to output the degree of \u201Ccharacter-likeness.\u201D\
  \ The third is selection of a single binarized image with the maximum degree of\
  \ \u201Ccharacter likeness\u201D as an optimal binarization result. Experiments\
  \ using a total of 1000 single-character color images extracted from the ICDAR 2003\
  \ robust OCR dataset show that the proposed method achieves a correct binarization\
  \ rate of 93.7%."
