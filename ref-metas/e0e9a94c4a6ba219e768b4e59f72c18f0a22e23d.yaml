paperAbstract: 'The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account,
  deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour,
  of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement
  learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however,
  agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations
  of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize
  past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to
  solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and
  hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural
  data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic
  neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement
  learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability
  has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted,
  or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent
  advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed
  a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional
  sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on
  the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep
  Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able
  to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable
  to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the
  same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the
  divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first
  artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging
  tasks.'
