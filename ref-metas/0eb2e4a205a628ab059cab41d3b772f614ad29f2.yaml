paperAbstract: To allow the hidden units of a restricted Boltzmann machine to model
  the transformation between two successive images, Memisevic and Hinton (2007) introduced
  three-way multiplicative interactions that use the intensity of a pixel in the first
  image as a multiplicative gain on a learned, symmetric weight between a pixel in
  the second image and a hidden unit. This creates cubically many parameters, which
  form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation
  to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way
  outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between
  larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model
  as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations.
  We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real
  image sequences. We also show how learning about image transformations allows the
  model to perform a simple visual analogy task, and we show how a completely unsupervised
  network trained on transformations perceives multiple motions of transparent dot
  patterns in the same way as humans.
