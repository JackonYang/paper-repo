paperAbstract: "This paper presents a method for determining the GPS location of a\
  \ ground-based object when imaged from a fixed-wing miniature air vehicle (MAV).\
  \ Using the pixel location of the target in an image, measurements of MAV position\
  \ and attitude, and camera pose angles, the target is localized in world coordinates.\
  \ The main contribution of this paper is to present four techniques for reducing\
  \ the localization error. In particular, we discuss RLS filtering, bias estimation,\
  \ flight path selection, and wind estimation. The localization method has been implemented\
  \ and flight tested on BYU\u2019s MAV testbed and experimental results are presented\
  \ demonstrating the localization of a target to within 3\_m of its known GPS location."
