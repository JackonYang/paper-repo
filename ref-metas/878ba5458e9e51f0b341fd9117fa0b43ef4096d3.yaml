paperAbstract: Many state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition
  (LVCSR) Systems are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).
  Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural
  architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge,
  all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules.
  We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention
  mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between
  sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied
  to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding
  up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and
  by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition
  accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall
  Street Journal corpus.
