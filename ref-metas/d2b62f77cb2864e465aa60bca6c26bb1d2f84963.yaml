paperAbstract: Gaussian mixture models are currently the dominant technique for modeling
  the emission distribution of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. We show
  that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing
  Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features
  and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a
  multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making
  use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed
  the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust
  the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution
  over the states of monophone hidden Markov models.
