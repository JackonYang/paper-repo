paperAbstract: We present three classifiers used in automatic forms class identification.
  The first category of classifier includes the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and the
  multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. The second category corresponds to a new
  structural classifier based on tree comparison. The low level information based
  on a pyramidal decomposition of the document image is used by the kNN and the MLP
  classifiers, while the high level information represents the form content with a
  hierarchical structure used by the new structural classifier. Experimental results
  are presented. Some strategies of classifier co-operation are proposed.
