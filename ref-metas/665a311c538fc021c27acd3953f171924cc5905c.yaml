paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure for image captioning
  models based on policy gradient methods. This allows us to directly optimize for
  the metrics of interest, rather than just maximizing likelihood of human generated
  captions. We show that by optimizing for standard metrics such as BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR
  and ROUGE, we can develop a system that improve on the metrics and ranks first on
  the MSCOCO image captioning leader board, even though our CNN-RNN model is much
  simpler than state of the art models. We further show that by also optimizing for
  the recently introduced SPICE metric, which measures semantic quality of captions,
  we can produce a system that significantly outperforms other methods as measured
  by human evaluation. Finally, we show how we can leverage extra sources of information,
  such as pre-trained image tagging models, to further improve quality.
