paperAbstract: One of the central knowledge sources of an information extraction (IE)
  system IS a dictionary of linguistic patterns that can be used to identify references
  to relevant information in a text Automatic creation of conceptual dictionaries
  is important for portability and scalability of an IE system This paper describes
  CRYSTAL, a system which automatically induces a dictionary of "concept-node definitions"
  sufficient to identify relevant information from a training corpus Each of these
  concept-node definitions is generalized as far as possible without producing errors,
  so that a minimum number of dictionary entries cover the positive training instances
  Because it tests the accuracy of each proposed definition, CRYSTAL can often surpass
  human intuitions in creating reliable extraction rules.
