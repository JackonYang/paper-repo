paperAbstract: Many applications involve multiple-modalities such as text and images
  that describe the problem of interest. In order to leverage the information present
  in all the modalities, one must model the relationships between them. While some
  techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem, they either are restricted
  to words describing visual objects only, or require full correspondences between
  the different modalities. As a consequence, they are unable to tackle more realistic
  scenarios where a narrative text is only loosely related to an image, and where
  only a few image-text pairs are available. In this paper, we propose a model that
  addresses both these challenges. Our model can be seen as a Markov random field
  of topic models, which connects the documents based on their similarity. As a consequence,
  the topics learned with our model are shared across connected documents, thus encoding
  the relations between different modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our model for image retrieval from a loosely related text.
