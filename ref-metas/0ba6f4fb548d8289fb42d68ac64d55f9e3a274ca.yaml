paperAbstract: 'The notion of using context information for solving high-level vision
  and medical image segmentation problems has been increasingly realized in the field.
  However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an
  image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov
  Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific
  algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation.
  In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training
  images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local
  image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps
  created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition
  to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates
  until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by
  fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit
  shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to
  implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm
  to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human
  body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also
  plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures
  are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes
  resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied
  to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms
  specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm
  goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety
  of problems for structured prediction problems.'
