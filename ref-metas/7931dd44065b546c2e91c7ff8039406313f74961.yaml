paperAbstract: "A new technique for color reduction of complex document images is\
  \ presented in this article. It reduces significantly the number of colors of the\
  \ document image (less than 15 colors in most of the cases) so as to have solid\
  \ characters and uniform local backgrounds. Therefore, this technique can be used\
  \ as a preprocessing step by text information extraction applications. Specifically,\
  \ using the edge map of the document image, a representative set of samples is chosen\
  \ that constructs a 3D color histogram. Based on these samples in the 3D color space,\
  \ a relatively large number of colors (usually no more than 100 colors) are obtained\
  \ by using a simple clustering procedure. The final colors are obtained by applying\
  \ a mean\u2010shift based procedure. Also, an edge preserving smoothing filter is\
  \ used as a preprocessing stage that enhances significantly the quality of the initial\
  \ image. Experimental results prove the method's capability of producing correctly\
  \ segmented complex color documents where the character elements can be easily extracted\
  \ as connected components. \xA9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Imaging Syst\
