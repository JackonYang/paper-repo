paperAbstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive
  autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our
  method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment
  prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches
  on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined
  sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model's ability
  to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the
  experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with
  multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures
  emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over
  such labels compared to several competitive baselines.
