paperAbstract: Real-world learning tasks may involve high-dimensional data sets with
  arbitrary patterns of missing data. In this paper we present a framework based on
  maximum likelihood density estimation for learning from such data set.s. We use
  mixture models for the density estimates and make two distinct appeals to the Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) principle (Dempster et al., 1977) in deriving a learning algorithm--EM is used
  both for the estimation of mixture components and for coping with missing data.
  The resulting algorithm is applicable to a wide range of supervised as well as unsupervised
  learning problems. Results from a classification benchmark--the iris data set--are
  presented.
