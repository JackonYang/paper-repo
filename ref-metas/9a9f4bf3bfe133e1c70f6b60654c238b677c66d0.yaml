paperAbstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have showed success in achieving
  translation invariance for many image processing tasks. The success is largely attributed
  to the use of local filtering and max-pooling in the CNN architecture. In this paper,
  we propose to apply CNN to speech recognition within the framework of hybrid NN-HMM
  model. We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to
  normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance.
  In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at
  the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech
  signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker
  independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental
  results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction
  in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number
  of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the
  proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT
  test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model.
