paperAbstract: Existing methods for pixel-wise labelling tasks generally disregard
  the underlying structure of labellings, often leading to predictions that are visually
  implausible. While incorporating structure into the model should improve prediction
  quality, doing so is challenging - manually specifying the form of structural constraints
  may be impractical and inference often becomes intractable even if structural constraints
  are given. We sidestep this problem by reducing structured prediction to a sequence
  of unconstrained prediction problems and demonstrate that this approach is capable
  of automatically discovering priors on shape, contiguity of region predictions and
  smoothness of region contours from data without any a priori specification. On the
  instance segmentation task, this method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving
  a mean APr of 63:6% at 50% overlap and 43:3% at 70% overlap.
