paperAbstract: We construct orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets, with
  arbitrarily high regularity. The order of regularity increases linearly with the
  support width. We start by reviewing the concept of multiresolution analysis as
  well as several algorithms in vision decomposition and reconstruction. The construction
  then follows from a synthesis of these different approaches.
