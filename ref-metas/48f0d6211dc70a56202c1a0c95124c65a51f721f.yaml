paperAbstract: Efficient categorizations of complex visual stimuli require effective
  encodings of their distinctive properties. However, the question remains of how
  processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with
  different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests
  that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is
  perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined
  scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different
  spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene
  might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information
  for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis
  that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment
  1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset
  of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one
  scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale.
  The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently
  processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input
  scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial
  scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations.
