paperAbstract: Olshausen and Field (1996) applied the principle of independence maximization
  by sparse coding to extract features from natural images. This leads to the emergence
  of oriented linear filters that have simultaneous localization in space and in frequency,
  thus resembling Gabor functions and simple cell receptive fields. In this article,
  we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence
  of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells.
  This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms
  of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear
  filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces
  then indicate the values of invariant features.
