paperAbstract: This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The
  success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals
  for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit
  the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the
  form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class
  of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the
  operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector
  has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization
  to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On
  specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty
  principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main
  goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at
  any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which
  edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We
  extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different
  signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature
  synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different
  scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably
  as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
