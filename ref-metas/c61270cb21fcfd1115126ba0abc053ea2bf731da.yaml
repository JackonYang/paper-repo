paperAbstract: 'Most documents include various layout objects such as headlines text
  lines charts and tables. In particular tables are powerful tools that allow large
  quantities of data to be easily understood. An automated document entry system is
  needed that can recognize the document layout objects and extract the information
  from tables. In this paper an effective table recognition method is described. The
  proposed method is composed of three steps: (1) document layout structure recognition
  (2) table layout structure recognition (3) table content recognition. To develop
  the table layout structure recognition step we first examined the layout structure
  of tables in existing documents and classified several common structures. As a result
  of the examination we created ten rules and designed a ruled line and box extraction
  algorithm based on these rules. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been
  confirmed in experiments. Accordingly the proposed method will greatly contribute
  to the creation of an automated document entry system to allow faster document recognition
  and permit the data in tables to be extracted.'
