paperAbstract: We introduce a fast, multiscale algorithm for image segmentation. Our
  algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized
  cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen
  operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical
  decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by
  applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem
  is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During
  this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging
  segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the
  pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to
  the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired
  by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric
  networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images.
