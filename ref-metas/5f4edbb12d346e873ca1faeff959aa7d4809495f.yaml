paperAbstract: Recognition of text in natural scene images is becoming a prominent
  research area due to the widespread availablity of imaging devices in low-cost consumer
  products like mobile phones. To evaluate the performance of recent algorithms in
  detecting and recognizing text from complex images, the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading
  Competition was organized. Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with
  detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview
  of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset
  used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating
  methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results
  using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance.
