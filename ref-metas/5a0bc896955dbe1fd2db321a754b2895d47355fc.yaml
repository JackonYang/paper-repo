paperAbstract: In this chapter, we have proposed two novel architectures for dealing
  with sequence learning problems in which data is not obtained from physical measurements
  over time. The new architectures remove the causality assumption that characterize
  current connectionist approaches to learning sequential translations. Using bidirectional
  recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) on the protein secondary structure prediction
  task appears to be very promising. Our performance is very close to the best existing
  systems although our usage of profiles is not as sophisticated. One improvement
  of our prediction system could be obtained by using profiles from the TrEMBL database.
