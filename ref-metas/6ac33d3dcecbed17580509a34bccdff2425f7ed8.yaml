paperAbstract: Visual Question answering is a challenging problem requiring a combination
  of concepts from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Most existing
  approaches use a two streams strategy, computing image and question features that
  are consequently merged using a variety of techniques. Nonetheless, very few rely
  on higher level image representations, which allow to capture semantic and spatial
  relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach for Visual
  Question Answering. Our method combines a graph learner module, which learns a question
  specific graph representation of the input image, with the recent concept of graph
  convolutions, aiming to learn image representations that capture question specific
  interactions. We test our approach on the VQA v2 dataset using a simple baseline
  architecture enhanced by the proposed graph learner module. We obtain state of the
  art results with 66.18% accuracy and demonstrate the interpretability of the proposed
  method.
