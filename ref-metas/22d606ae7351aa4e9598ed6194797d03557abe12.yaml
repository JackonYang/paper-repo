paperAbstract: Several new algorithms for visual correspondence based on graph cuts
  have recently been developed. While these methods give very strong results in practice,
  they do not handle occlusions properly. Specifically, they treat the two input images
  asymmetrically, and they do not ensure that a pixel corresponds to at most one pixel
  in the other image. In this paper, we present a new method which properly addresses
  occlusions, while preserving the advantages of graph cut algorithms. We give experimental
  results for stereo as well as motion, which demonstrate that our method performs
  well both at detecting occlusions and computing disparities.
