paperAbstract: A growing population of users want to extract a growing variety of
  information from on-line texts. Unfortunately, current information extraction systems
  typically require experts to hand-build dictionaries of extraction patterns for
  each new type of information to be extracted. This paper presents a system that
  can learn dictionaries of extraction patterns directly from user-provided examples
  of texts and events to be extracted from them. The system, called LIEP, learns patterns
  that recognize relationships between key constituents based on local syntax. Sets
  of patterns learned by LIEP for a sample extraction task perform nearly at the level
  of a hand-built dictionary of patterns.
