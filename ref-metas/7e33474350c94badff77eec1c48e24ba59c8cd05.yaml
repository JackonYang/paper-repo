paperAbstract: Standard approaches to motion analysis assume that the optic flow is
  smooth; such techniques have trouble dealing with occlusion boundaries. The image
  sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's
  motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description
  are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring
  the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images
  into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques.
  It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information
  about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden
  sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence
  can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion
  parameters.<<ETX>>
