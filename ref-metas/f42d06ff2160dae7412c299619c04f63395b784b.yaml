paperAbstract: A multiscale Canny edge detection is equivalent to finding the local
  maxima of a wavelet transform. The authors study the properties of multiscale edges
  through the wavelet theory. For pattern recognition, one often needs to discriminate
  different types of edges. They show that the evolution of wavelet local maxima across
  scales characterize the local shape of irregular structures. Numerical descriptors
  of edge types are derived. The completeness of a multiscale edge representation
  is also studied. The authors describe an algorithm that reconstructs a close approximation
  of 1-D and 2-D signals from their multiscale edges. For images, the reconstruction
  errors are below visual sensitivity. As an application, a compact image coding algorithm
  that selects important edges and compresses the image data by factors over 30 has
  been implemented. >
