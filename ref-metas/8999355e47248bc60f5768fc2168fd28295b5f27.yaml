paperAbstract: Research with texture pairs having identical second-order statistics
  has revealed that the pre-attentive texture discrimination system cannot globally
  process third- and higher-order statistics, and that discrimination is the result
  of a few local conspicuous features, called textons. It seems that only the first-order
  statistics of these textons have perceptual significance, and the relative phase
  between textons cannot be perceived without detailed scrutiny by focal attention.
