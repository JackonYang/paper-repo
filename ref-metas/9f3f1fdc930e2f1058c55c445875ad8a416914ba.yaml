paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The CNS needs to be understood at four nearly independent
  levels of description: (1) that at which the nature of a computation is expressed;
  (2) that at which the algorithms that implement a computation are characterized;
  (3) that at which an algorithm is committed to particular mechanisms; and (4) that
  at which the mechanisms are realized in hardware. In general, the nature of a computation
  is determined by the problem to be solved, the mechanisms that are used depend upon
  the available hardware, and the particular algorithms chosen depend on the problem
  and on the available mechanisms. Examples are given of theories at each level. (Author)'
