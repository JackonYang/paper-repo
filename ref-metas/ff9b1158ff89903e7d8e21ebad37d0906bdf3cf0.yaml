paperAbstract: This paper describes a software package, called LOQO, which implements
  a primal-dual interior-point method for general nonlinear programming. We focus
  in this paper mainly on the algorithm as it applies to linear and quadratic programming
  with only brief mention of the extensions to convex and general nonlinear programming,
  since a detailed paper describing these extensions was published recently elsewhere.
  In particular, we emphasize the importance of establishing and maintaining symmetric
  quasidefiniteness of the reduced KKT system. We show that the industry standard
  MPS format can be nicely formulated in such a way to provide quasidefiniteness.
  Computational results are included for a variety of linear and quadratic programming
  problems.
