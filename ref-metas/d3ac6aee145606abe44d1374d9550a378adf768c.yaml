paperAbstract: In recent years many researchers have investigated the use of Markov
  random fields (MRFs) for computer vision. The computational complexity of the implementation
  has been a drawback of MRFs. In this paper we derive deterministic approximations
  to MRFs models. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the
  mean field theory from statistical mechanics. Because we use MRFs models the mean
  field equations lead to parallel and iterative algorithms. One of the considered
  models for image reconstruction is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non-convexity
  algorithm proposed by Blake and Zisserman.
