paperAbstract: We describe a method for classifying news stories using Memory Based
  Reasoning (MBR) a k-nearest neighbor method), that does not require manual topic
  definitions. Using an already coded training database of about 50,000 stories from
  the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a text retrieval system
  that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match engine, codes are assigned
  to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80% and precision of about 70%. There
  are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer,
  we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories
  and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval
  system, we achieved these results in about two person-months. We believe this approach
  is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems
  involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message routing
  etc.
