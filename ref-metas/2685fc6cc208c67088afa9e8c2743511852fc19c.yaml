paperAbstract: Stochastic unification-based grammars (SUBGs) define exponential distributions
  over the parses generated by a unification-based grammar (UBG). Existing algorithms
  for parsing and estimation require the enumeration of all of the parses of a string
  in order to determine the most likely one, or in order to calculate the statistics
  needed to estimate a grammar from a training corpus. This paper describes a graph-based
  dynamic programming algorithm for calculating these statistics from the packed UBG
  parse representations of Maxwell and Kaplan (1995) which does not require enumerating
  all parses. Like many graphical algorithms, the dynamic programming algorithm's
  complexity is worst-case exponential, but is often polynomial. The key observation
  is that by using Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations, the required statistics
  can be rewritten as either the max or the sum of a product of functions. This is
  exactly the kind of problem which can be solved by dynamic programming over graphical
  models.
