paperAbstract: 'We present a general approach for the hierarchical segmentation and
  labeling of document layout structures. This approach models document layout as
  a grammar and performs a global search for the optimal parse based on a grammatical
  cost function. Our contribution is to utilize machine learning to discriminatively
  select features and set all parameters in the parsing process. Therefore, and unlike
  many other approaches for layout analysis, ours can easily adapt itself to a variety
  of document analysis problems. One need only specify the page grammar and provide
  a set of correctly labeled pages. We apply this technique to two document image
  analysis tasks: page layout structure extraction and mathematical expression interpretation.
  Experiments demonstrate that the learned grammars can be used to extract the document
  structure in 57 files from the UWIII document image database. We also show that
  the same framework can be used to automatically interpret printed mathematical expressions
  so as to recreate the original LaTeX'
