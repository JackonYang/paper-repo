paperAbstract: The wealth of information on the web makes it an attractive resource
  for seeking quick answers to simple, factual questions such as &quote;who was the
  first American in space?&quote; or &quote;what is the second tallest mountain in
  the world?&quote; Yet today's most advanced web search services (e.g., Google and
  AskJeeves) make it surprisingly tedious to locate answers to such questions. In
  this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information
  retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance.First
  we introduce Mulder, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated
  question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe Mulder's architecture,
  which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a
  novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally,
  we compare Mulder's performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn
  from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that Mulder's recall is more than
  a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google
  requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as Mulder.
