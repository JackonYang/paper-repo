paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a multi-cue vision system for the real-time detection
  and tracking of pedestrians from a moving vehicle. The detection component involves
  a cascade of modules, each utilizing complementary visual criteria to successively
  narrow down the image search space, balancing robustness and efficiency considerations.
  Novel is the tight integration of the consecutive modules: (sparse) stereo-based
  ROI generation, shape-based detection, texture-based classification and (dense)
  stereo-based verification. For example, shape-based detection activates a weighted
  combination of texture-based classifiers, each attuned to a particular body pose.Performance
  of individual modules and their interaction is analyzed by means of Receiver Operator
  Characteristics (ROCs). A sequential optimization technique allows the successive
  combination of individual ROCs, providing optimized system parameter settings in
  a systematic fashion, avoiding ad-hoc parameter tuning. Application-dependent processing
  constraints can be incorporated in the optimization procedure.Results from extensive
  field tests in difficult urban traffic conditions suggest system performance is
  at the leading edge.'
