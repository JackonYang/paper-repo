paperAbstract: We propose a new method for detecting objects such as bags carried
  by pedestrians depicted in short video sequences. In common with earlier work [1,2]
  on the same problem, the method starts by averaging aligned foreground regions of
  a walking pedestrian to produce a representation of motion and shape (known as a
  temporal template) that has some immunity to noise in foreground segmentations and
  phase of the walking cycle. Our key novelty is for carried objects to be revealed
  by comparing the temporal templates against view-specific exemplars generated offline
  for unencumbered pedestrians. A likelihood map obtained from this match is combined
  in a Markov random field with a map of prior probabilities for carried objects and
  a spatial continuity assumption, from which we obtain a segmentation of carried
  objects using the MAP solution. We have re-implemented the earlier state of the
  art method [1] and demonstrate a substantial improvement in performance for the
  new method on the challenging PETS2006 dataset [3]. Although developed for a specific
  problem, the method could be applied to the detection of irregularities in appearance
  for other categories of object that move in a periodic fashion.
