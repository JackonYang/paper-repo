paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The field of picture processing by computer is reviewed
  from a technique-oriented standpoint. Only the processing of given pictures (as
  opposed to computer-synthesized pictures) is considered. Specific areas covered
  include: (a) Pictures as information sources and their efficient encoding; (b) Approximation
  of pictures - sampling and quantization techniques; (c) Position-invariant operations
  on pictures and their implementation (digital, electro-optical, optical); applications
  to matched filtering (template matching), spatial frequency filtering and image
  restoration, measurement of image quality, and image enhancement (''smoothing''
  and ''sharpening''); (d) Picture properties (linear; local and ''textural''; random)
  useful for pictorial pattern recognition; (e) ''Figure extraction'' from pictures;
  figure properties (topology, size, shape); (f) Picture description and ''picture
  languages.'' (Author)'
