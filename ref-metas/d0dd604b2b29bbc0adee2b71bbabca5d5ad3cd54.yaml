paperAbstract: 'An incremental, higher-order, non-recurrent network combines two properties
  found to be useful for learning sequential tasks: higher-order connections and incremental
  introduction of new units. The network adds higher orders when needed by adding
  new units that dynamically modify connection weights. Since the new units modify
  the weights at the next time-step with information from the previous step, temporal
  tasks can be learned without the use of feedback, thereby greatly simplifying training.
  Furthermore, a theoretically unlimited number of units can be added to reach into
  the arbitrarily distant past. Experiments with the Reber grammar have demonstrated
  speedups of two orders of magnitude over recurrent networks.'
