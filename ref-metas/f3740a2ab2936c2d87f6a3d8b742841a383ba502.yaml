paperAbstract: Computer sensing of hand and limb motion is an important problem for
  applications in human computer interaction and computer graphics. We describe a
  framework for local trading of self occluding motion, in which one part of an object
  obstructs the visibility of another. Our approach uses a kinematic model to predict
  occlusions and windowed templates to track partially occluded objects. We present
  offline 3D tracking results for hand motion with significant self occlusion.<<ETX>>
