paperAbstract: Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally
  attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted
  image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual
  system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for
  extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary
  framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information.
  As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index
  and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison
  to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database
  of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed
  algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu//spl sim/lcv/ssim/.
