paperAbstract: Detecting text and caption from videos is important and in great demand
  for video retrieval, annotation, indexing, and content analysis. In this paper,
  we present a corner based approach to detect text and caption from videos. This
  approach is inspired by the observation that there exist dense and orderly presences
  of corner points in characters, especially in text and caption. We use several discriminative
  features to describe the text regions formed by the corner points. The usage of
  these features is in a flexible manner, thus, can be adapted to different applications.
  Language independence is an important advantage of the proposed method. Moreover,
  based upon the text features, we further develop a novel algorithm to detect moving
  captions in videos. In the algorithm, the motion features, extracted by optical
  flow, are combined with text features to detect the moving caption patterns. The
  decision tree is adopted to learn the classification criteria. Experiments conducted
  on a large volume of real video shots demonstrate the efficiency and robustness
  of our proposed approaches and the real-world system. Our text and caption detection
  system was recently highlighted in a worldwide multimedia retrieval competition,
  Star Challenge, by achieving the superior performance with the top ranking.
