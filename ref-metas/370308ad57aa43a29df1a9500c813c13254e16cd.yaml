paperAbstract: In this work we propose a hierarchical approach for labeling semantic
  objects and regions in scenes. Our approach is reminiscent of early vision literature
  in that we use a decomposition of the image in order to encode relational and spatial
  information. In contrast to much existing work on structured prediction for scene
  understanding, we bypass a global probabilistic model and instead directly train
  a hierarchical inference procedure inspired by the message passing mechanics of
  some approximate inference procedures in graphical models. This approach mitigates
  both the theoretical and empirical difficulties of learning probabilistic models
  when exact inference is intractable. In particular, we draw from recent work in
  machine learning and break the complex inference process into a hierarchical series
  of simple machine learning subproblems. Each subproblem in the hierarchy is designed
  to capture the image and contextual statistics in the scene. This hierarchy spans
  coarse-to-fine regions and explicitly models the mixtures of semantic labels that
  may be present due to imperfect segmentation. To avoid cascading of errors and overfitting,
  we train the learning problems in sequence to ensure robustness to likely errors
  earlier in the inference sequence and leverage the stacking approach developed by
  Cohen et al.
