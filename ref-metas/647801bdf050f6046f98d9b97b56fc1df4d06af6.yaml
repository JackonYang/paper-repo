paperAbstract: Abstract. This paper describes WBIIS (Wavelet-Based Image Indexing
  and Searching), a new image indexing and retrieval algorithm with partial sketch
  image searching capability for large image databases. The algorithm characterizes
  the color variations over the spatial extent of the image in a manner that provides
  semantically meaningful image comparisons. The indexing algorithm applies a Daubechies'
  wavelet transform for each of the three opponent color components. The wavelet coefficients
  in the lowest few frequency bands, and their variances, are stored as feature vectors.
  To speed up retrieval, a two-step procedure is used that first does a crude selection
  based on the variances, and then refines the search by performing a feature vector
  match between the selected images and the query. For better accuracy in searching,
  two-level multiresolution matching may also be used. Masks are used for partial-sketch
  queries. This technique performs much better in capturing coherence of image, object
  granularity, local color/texture, and bias avoidance than traditional color layout
  algorithms. WBIIS is much faster and more accurate than traditional algorithms.
  When tested on a database of more than 10 000 general-purpose images, the best 100
  matches were found in 3.3 seconds.
