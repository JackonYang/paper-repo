paperAbstract: "We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic\
  \ regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widely-held belief that discriminative\
  \ classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct\
  \ regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each\
  \ algorithm does better. This stems from the observation\u2014which is borne out\
  \ in repeated experiments\u2014that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic\
  \ error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error\
  \ much faster."
