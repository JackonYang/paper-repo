paperAbstract: We adapt the greedy Stack-LSTM dependency parser of Dyer et al. (2015)
  to support a training-with-exploration procedure using dynamic oracles(Goldberg
  and Nivre, 2013) instead of cross-entropy minimization. This form of training, which
  accounts for model predictions at training time rather than assuming an error-free
  action history, improves parsing accuracies for both English and Chinese, obtaining
  very strong results for both languages. We discuss some modifications needed in
  order to get training with exploration to work well for a probabilistic neural-network.
