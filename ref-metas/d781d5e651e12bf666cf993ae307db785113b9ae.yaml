paperAbstract: An approach to visual object recognition in which a 3D object is represented
  by the linear combination of 2D images of the object is proposed. It is shown that
  for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of
  possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small
  number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation
  is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often
  holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without
  scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object
  by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations.
  Three alternative methods of determining the transformation that matches a model
  to a given image are proposed. >
