paperAbstract: A novel approach to incrementally estimating visual motion over a sequence
  of images is presented. The authors start by formulating constraints on image motion
  to account for the possibility of multiple motions. This is achieved by exploiting
  the notions of weak continuity and robust statistics in the formulation of a minimization
  problem. The resulting objective function is non-convex. Traditional stochastic
  relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the
  task. A highly parallel incremental stochastic minimization algorithm is presented
  which has a number of advantages over previous approaches. The incremental nature
  of the scheme makes it dynamic and permits the detection of occlusion and disocclusion
  boundaries.<<ETX>>
