paperAbstract: "This paper presents an objective comparative evaluation of page segmentation\
  \ and region classification methods for documents with complex layouts. It describes\
  \ the competition (modus operandi, dataset and evaluation methodology) held in the\
  \ context of ICDAR2017, presenting the results of the evaluation of seven methods\
  \ \u2013 five submitted, two state-of-the-art systems (commercial and open-source).\
  \ Three scenarios are reported in this paper, one evaluating the ability of methods\
  \ to accurately segment regions and two evaluating both segmentation and region\
  \ classification (one focusing only on text regions). For the first time, nested\
  \ region content (table cells, chart labels etc.) are evaluated in addition to the\
  \ top-level page content. Text recognition was a bonus challenge and was not taken\
  \ up by all participants. The results indicate that an innovative approach has a\
  \ clear advantage but there is still a considerable need to develop robust methods\
  \ that deal with layout challenges, especially with the non-textual content."
