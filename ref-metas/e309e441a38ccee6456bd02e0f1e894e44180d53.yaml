paperAbstract: Natural images contain characteristic statistical regularities that
  set them apart from purely random images. Understanding what these regularities
  are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe
  some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show
  how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the
  visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e.
  more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based
  on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for
  finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for
  an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation,
  and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in
  developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the
  mammalian striate cortex.
