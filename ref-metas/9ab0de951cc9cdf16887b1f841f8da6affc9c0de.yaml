paperAbstract: "We apply Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) to the task of traffic\
  \ sign classification as part of the GTSRB competition. ConvNets are biologically-inspired\
  \ multi-stage architectures that automatically learn hierarchies of invariant features.\
  \ While many popular vision approaches use hand-crafted features such as HOG or\
  \ SIFT, ConvNets learn features at every level from data that are tuned to the task\
  \ at hand. The traditional ConvNet architecture was modified by feeding 1st stage\
  \ features in addition to 2nd stage features to the classifier. The system yielded\
  \ the 2nd-best accuracy of 98.97% during phase I of the competition (the best entry\
  \ obtained 98.98%), above the human performance of 98.81%, using 32\xD732 color\
  \ input images. Experiments conducted after phase 1 produced a new record of 99.17%\
  \ by increasing the network capacity, and by using greyscale images instead of color.\
  \ Interestingly, random features still yielded competitive results (97.33%)."
