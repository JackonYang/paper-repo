paperAbstract: Applying convolutional neural networks to large images is computationally
  expensive because the amount of computation scales linearly with the number of image
  pixels. We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting
  information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions
  or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional
  neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in,
  but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the
  input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using
  reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our
  model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms
  a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual
  control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training
  signal for doing so.
