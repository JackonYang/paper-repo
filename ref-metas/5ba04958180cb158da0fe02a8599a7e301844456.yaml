paperAbstract: An approach to automatic text location and identification of colored
  book and journal covers is proposed. To reduce the amount of small variations in
  color, a clustering algorithm is applied in a preprocessing step. Two methods have
  been developed for extracting text hypotheses. One is based on a top-down analysis
  using successive splitting of image regions. The other is a bottom-up region growing
  algorithm. The results of both methods are combined to robustly distinguish between
  text and non-text elements. Text elements are binarized using automatically extracted
  information about text color. The binarized text regions can be used as input for
  a conventional OCR module. Results are shown for parts of book and journal covers
  of different complexity. The proposed method is not restricted to cover pages, but
  can be applied to the extraction of text from other types of color images as well.
