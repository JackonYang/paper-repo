paperAbstract: This inquiry examines a technique for automatically classifying (indexing)
  documents according to their subject content. The task, in essence, is to have a
  computing machine read a document and on the basis of the occurrence of selected
  clue words decide to which of many subject categories the document in question belongs.
  This paper describes the design, execution and evaluation of a modest experimental
  study aimed at testing empirically one statistical technique for automatic indexing.
