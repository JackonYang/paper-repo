paperAbstract: "\n \n In this paper, we propose to employ the convolutional neural\
  \ network (CNN) for the image question answering (QA) task. Our proposed CNN provides\
  \ an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures for learning not only\
  \ the image and question representations, but also their inter-modal interactions\
  \ to produce the answer. More specifically, our model consists of three CNNs: one\
  \ image CNN to encode the image content, one sentence CNN to compose the words of\
  \ the question, and one multimodal convolution layer to learn their joint representation\
  \ for the classification in the space of candidate answer words. We demonstrate\
  \ the efficacy of our proposed model on the DAQUAR and COCO-QA datasets, which are\
  \ two benchmark datasets for image QA, with the performances significantly outperforming\
  \ the state-of-the-art.\n \n"
