paperAbstract: We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can
  be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition
  with verbal and nominal heads, estimated on the basis of distribution in an automatically
  parsed corpus. This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate
  solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.
