paperAbstract: In biological visual systems, it is not obvious whether coding efficiency
  as measured by mutual information among the neurons is a factor that explains any
  of their properties. The center/surround receptive field profiles of neurons in
  the retina and geniculate are far from an orthogonal set, but a given neuron can
  still be regarded as a decorrelator of the incoming signal in the sense that it
  responds primarily to changes in the image. At the level of the brain's visual cortex,
  the introduction of the new variable of orientation selectivity can be regarded
  not only as a means for providing orientation labels for image structure, but also
  more basically as an effective decorrelator of the neural representation. The present
  image coding simulations, based on quantitative neurobiological data about the code
  primitives, provide measures of the bit-rate efficiency of such oriented, quadrature,
  neural codes. Demonstrations of data compression to below 1 bit/pixel in cortically-based,
  quadrature self-similar wavelet image codes are also provided.<<ETX>>
