paperAbstract: Deep convolutional neural networks have recently achieved state-of-the-art
  performance on a number of image recognition benchmarks, including the ImageNet
  Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC-2012). The winning model on the
  localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence
  score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image
  context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object
  in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance.
  In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection,
  which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score
  for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest.
  The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows
  for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able
  to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using
  only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural
  network evaluations.
