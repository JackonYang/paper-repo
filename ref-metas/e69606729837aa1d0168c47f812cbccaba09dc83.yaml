paperAbstract: An analog model neural network that can solve a general problem of
  recognizing patterns in a time-dependent signal is presented. The networks use a
  patterned set of delays to collectively focus stimulus sequence information to a
  neural state at a future time. The computational capabilities of the circuit are
  demonstrated on tasks somewhat similar to those necessary for the recognition of
  words in a continuous stream of speech. The network architecture can be understood
  from consideration of an energy function that is being minimized as the circuit
  computes. Neurobiological mechanisms are known for the generation of appropriate
  delays.
