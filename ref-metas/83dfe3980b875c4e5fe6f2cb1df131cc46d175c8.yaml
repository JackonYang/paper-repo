paperAbstract: Building robust low and mid-level image representations, beyond edge
  primitives, is a long-standing goal in vision. Many existing feature detectors spatially
  pool edge information which destroys cues such as edge intersections, parallelism
  and symmetry. We present a learning framework where features that capture these
  mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data. Our approach is based on the
  convolutional decomposition of images under a spar-sity constraint and is totally
  unsupervised. By building a hierarchy of such decompositions we can learn rich feature
  sets that are a robust image representation for both the analysis and synthesis
  of images.
