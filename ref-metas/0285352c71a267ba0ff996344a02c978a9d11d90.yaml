paperAbstract: Scene text recognition has inspired great interests from the computer
  vision community in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel scene text recognition
  method using part-based tree-structured character detection. Different from conventional
  multi-scale sliding window character detection strategy, which does not make use
  of the character-specific structure information, we use part-based tree-structure
  to model each type of character so as to detect and recognize the characters at
  the same time. While for word recognition, we build a Conditional Random Field model
  on the potential character locations to incorporate the detection scores, spatial
  constraints and linguistic knowledge into one framework. The final word recognition
  result is obtained by minimizing the cost function defined on the random field.
  Experimental results on a range of challenging public datasets (ICDAR 2003, ICDAR
  2011, SVT) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  significantly both for character detection and word recognition.
