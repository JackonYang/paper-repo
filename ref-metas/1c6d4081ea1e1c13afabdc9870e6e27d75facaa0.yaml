paperAbstract: We describe two new color indexing techniques. The first one is a more
  robust version of the commonly used color histogram indexing. In the index we store
  the cumulative color histograms. The L1-, L2-, L(infinity )-distance between two
  cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these
  two color distributions. We show that this method produces slightly better results
  than color histogram methods, but it is significantly more robust with respect to
  the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example
  of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions,
  the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing
  the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for
  a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function
  which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between
  corresponding moments. Our tests clearly demonstrate that a retrieval based on this
  technique produces better results and runs faster than the histogram-based methods.
