paperAbstract: 'We seek to discover the object categories depicted in a set of unlabelled
  images. We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature:
  probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to
  discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here
  we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several
  categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by
  using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region
  descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual
  domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and
  their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this
  unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003)
  on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the
  bag-of-words vocabulary to include ''doublets'' which encode spatially local co-occurring
  regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image
  segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to
  a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate
  that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis
  of images.'
