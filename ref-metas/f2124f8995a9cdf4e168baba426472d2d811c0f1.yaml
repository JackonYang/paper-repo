paperAbstract: Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms have demonstrated
  a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the UPenn TREEBANK as a
  gold standard. In this paper we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free
  parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template
  elements and template relations.
