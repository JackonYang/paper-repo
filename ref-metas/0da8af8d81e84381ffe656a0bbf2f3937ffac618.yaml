paperAbstract: 'We investigate the problem of producing structured graph representations
  of visual scenes. Our work analyzes the role of motifs: regularly appearing substructures
  in scene graphs. We present new quantitative insights on such repeated structures
  in the Visual Genome dataset. Our analysis shows that object labels are highly predictive
  of relation labels but not vice-versa. We also find that there are recurring patterns
  even in larger subgraphs: more than 50% of graphs contain motifs involving at least
  two relations. Our analysis motivates a new baseline: given object detections, predict
  the most frequent relation between object pairs with the given labels, as seen in
  the training set. This baseline improves on the previous state-of-the-art by an
  average of 3.6% relative improvement across evaluation settings. We then introduce
  Stacked Motif Networks, a new architecture designed to capture higher order motifs
  in scene graphs that further improves over our strong baseline by an average 7.1%
  relative gain. Our code is available at github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs.'
