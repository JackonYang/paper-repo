paperAbstract: A relaxation process is described and is applied to the detection of
  smooth lines and curves in noisy, real world images. There are nine labels associated
  with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations
  and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In
  the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring
  points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one
  another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels
  are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented
  line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in
  which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other
  points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process,
  for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract
  this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many
  curves lie close to one another.
