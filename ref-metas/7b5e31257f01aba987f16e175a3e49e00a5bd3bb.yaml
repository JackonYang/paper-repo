paperAbstract: "We present a simple log-linear reparameterization of IBM Model 2 that\
  \ overcomes problems arising from Model 1\u2019s strong assumptions and Model 2\u2019\
  s overparameterization. Efficient inference, likelihood evaluation, and parameter\
  \ estimation algorithms are provided. Training the model is consistently ten times\
  \ faster than Model 4. On three large-scale translation tasks, systems built using\
  \ our alignment model outperform IBM Model 4. An open-source implementation of the\
  \ alignment model described in this paper is available from http://github.com/clab/fast\
