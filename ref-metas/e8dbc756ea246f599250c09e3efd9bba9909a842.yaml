paperAbstract: This paper presents a novel approach to automatic captioning of geo-tagged
  images by summarizing multiple web-documents that contain information related to
  an image's location. The summarizer is biased by dependency pattern models towards
  sentences which contain features typically provided for different scene types such
  as those of churches, bridges, etc. Our results show that summaries biased by dependency
  pattern models lead to significantly higher ROUGE scores than both n-gram language
  models reported in previous work and also Wikipedia baseline summaries. Summaries
  generated using dependency patterns also lead to more readable summaries than those
  generated without dependency patterns.
