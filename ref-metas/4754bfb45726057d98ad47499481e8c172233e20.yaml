paperAbstract: Visual discrimination experiments were conducted using unfamiliar displays
  generated by a digital computer. The displays contained two side-by-side fields
  with different statistical, topological or heuristic properties. Discrimination
  was defined as that spontaneous visual process which gives the immediate impression
  of two distinct fields. The condition for such discrimination was found to be based
  primarily on clusters or lines formed by proximate points of uniform brightness.
  A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using
  varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness. The limitations in discriminating
  complex line structures were also investigated.
