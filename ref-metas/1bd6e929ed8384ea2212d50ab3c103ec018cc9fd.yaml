paperAbstract: A Bayesian model of learning to learn by sampling from multiple tasks
  is presented. The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution
  over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally
  modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution.
  It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general
  we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea
  of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under
  these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior
  by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are
  given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously
  learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little
  knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small,
  then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the
  problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation
  (LDR) for an environment of related tasks.
