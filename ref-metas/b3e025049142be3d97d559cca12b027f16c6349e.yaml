paperAbstract: Shallow machine learning methods have been applied to chemoinformatics
  problems with some success. As more data becomes available and more complex problems
  are tackled, deep machine learning methods may also become useful. Here, we present
  a brief overview of deep learning methods and show in particular how recursive neural
  network approaches can be applied to the problem of predicting molecular properties.
  However, molecules are typically described by undirected cyclic graphs, while recursive
  approaches typically use directed acyclic graphs. Thus, we develop methods to address
  this discrepancy, essentially by considering an ensemble of recursive neural networks
  associated with all possible vertex-centered acyclic orientations of the molecular
  graph. One advantage of this approach is that it relies only minimally on the identification
  of suitable molecular descriptors because suitable representations are learned automatically
  from the data. Several variants of this approach are applied to the problem of predicting
  aqueous solubility and tested on four benchmark data sets. Experimental results
  show that the performance of the deep learning methods matches or exceeds the performance
  of other state-of-the-art methods according to several evaluation metrics and expose
  the fundamental limitations arising from training sets that are too small or too
  noisy. A Web-based predictor, AquaSol, is available online through the ChemDB portal
  ( cdb.ics.uci.edu ) together with additional material.
