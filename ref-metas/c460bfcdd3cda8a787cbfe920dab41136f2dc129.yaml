paperAbstract: Training semantic parsers from weak supervision (denotations) rather
  than strong supervision (programs) complicates training in two ways. First, a large
  search space of potential programs needs to be explored at training time to find
  a correct program. Second, spurious programs that accidentally lead to a correct
  denotation add noise to training. In this work we propose that in closed worlds
  with clear semantic types, one can substantially alleviate these problems by utilizing
  an abstract representation, where tokens in both the language utterance and program
  are lifted to an abstract form. We show that these abstractions can be defined with
  a handful of lexical rules and that they result in sharing between different examples
  that alleviates the difficulties in training. To test our approach, we develop the
  first semantic parser for CNLVR, a challenging visual reasoning dataset, where the
  search space is large and overcoming spuriousness is critical, because denotations
  are either TRUE or FALSE, and thus random programs are likely to lead to a correct
  denotation. Our method substantially improves performance, and reaches 82.5% accuracy,
  a 14.7% absolute accuracy improvement compared to the best reported accuracy so
  far.
