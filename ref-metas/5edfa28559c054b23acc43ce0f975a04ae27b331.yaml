paperAbstract: Tree-structured models have been widely used for human pose estimation,
  in either 2D or 3D. While such models allow efficient learning and inference, they
  fail to capture additional dependencies between body parts, other than kinematic
  constraints between connected parts. In this paper, we consider the use of multiple
  tree models, rather than a single tree model for human pose estimation. Our model
  can alleviate the limitations of a single tree-structured model by combining information
  provided across different tree models. The parameters of each individual tree model
  are trained via standard learning algorithms in a single tree-structured model.
  Different tree models can be combined in a discriminative fashion by a boosting
  procedure. We present experimental results showing the improvement of our approaches
  on two different datasets. On the first dataset, we use our multiple tree framework
  for occlusion reasoning. On the second dataset, we combine multiple deformable trees
  for capturing spatial constraints between non-connected body parts.
