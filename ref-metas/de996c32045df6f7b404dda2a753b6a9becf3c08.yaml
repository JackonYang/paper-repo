paperAbstract: 'This paper describes NETtalk, a class of massively-parallel network
  systems that learn to convert English text to speech. The memory representations
  for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing
  units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance.
  (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the
  better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance
  of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no
  single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much
  faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice
  is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can
  be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a
  particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit
  responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal
  that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound
  correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant
  internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size
  between highly localized and completely distributed representations.'
