paperAbstract: This paper describes a universal technology for automated data capture
  from documents with similar data but different layouts, such as invoices, claim
  forms, resumes, contracts, loan documents, etc. Prior to data capture, the relevant
  data are detected on the document image. A formalization of top-down document analysis
  is suggested and a language for describing document structures is presented. Formalized
  descriptions in this language can be compiled into executable code. The process
  of matching such formalized descriptions with actual semi-structured documents in
  order to find the relevant data is described.
