paperAbstract: "We describe a simple, fast, and accurate system for document image\
  \ zone classification \u2014 an important subproblem of document image analysis\
  \ \u2014 that results from a detailed analysis of different features. Using a novel\
  \ combination of known algorithms, we achieve a very competitive error rate of 1.46%\
  \ (n = 13811) in comparison to (Wang et al., 2006) who report an error rate of 1.55%\
  \ (n = 24177) using more complicated techniques. The experiments were performed\
  \ on zones extracted from the widely used UW-III database, which is representative\
  \ of images of scanned journal pages and contains ground-truthed real-world data."
