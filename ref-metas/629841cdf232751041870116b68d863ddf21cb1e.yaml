paperAbstract: Chinese is the most widely used language in the world. Algorithms that
  read Chinese text in natural images facilitate applications of various kinds. Despite
  the large potential value, datasets and competitions in the past primarily focus
  on English, which bares very different characteristics than Chinese. This report
  introduces RCTW, a new competition that focuses on Chinese text reading. The competition
  features a large-scale dataset with over 12,000 annotated images. Two tasks, namely
  text localization and end-to-end recognition, are set up. The competition took place
  from January 20 to May 31, 2017. 23 valid submissions were received from 19 teams.
  This report includes dataset description, task definitions, evaluation protocols,
  and results summaries and analysis. Through this competition, we call for more future
  research on the Chinese text reading problem.
