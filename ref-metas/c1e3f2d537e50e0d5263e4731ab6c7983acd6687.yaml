paperAbstract: A new method of estimating the entropy and redundancy of a language
  is described. This method exploits the knowledge of the language statistics possessed
  by those who speak the language, and depends on experimental results in prediction
  of the next letter when the preceding text is known. Results of experiments in prediction
  are given, and some properties of an ideal predictor are developed.
