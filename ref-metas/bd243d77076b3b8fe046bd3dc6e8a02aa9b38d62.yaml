paperAbstract: 'Videos have become ubiquitous due to the ease of capturing and sharing
  via social platforms like Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and others. The computer
  vision community has tried to tackle various video analysis problems independently.
  As a consequence, even though some really good hand-crafted features have been proposed
  there is a lack of generic features for video analysis. On the other hand, the image
  domain has progressed rapidly by using features from deep convolutional networks.
  These deep features are proving to be generic and perform well on variety of image
  tasks. In this work we propose Convolution 3D (C3D) feature, a generic spatio-temporal
  feature obtained by training a deep 3-dimensional convolutional network on a large
  annotated video dataset comprising objects, scenes, actions, and other frequently
  occurring concepts. We show that by using spatio-temporal convolutions the trained
  features encapsulate appearance and motion cues and perform well on different video
  classification tasks. C3D has three main advantages. First, it is generic: achieving
  state-ofthe-art results on object recognition, scene classification, sport classification,
  and action similarity labeling in videos. Second, it is compact: obtaining better
  accuracy than best hand-crafted features and best deep image features with a lower
  dimensional feature descriptor. Third, it is efficient to compute: 91 times faster
  than current hand-crafted features, and two orders of magnitude faster than current
  deeplearning based video classification methods.'
