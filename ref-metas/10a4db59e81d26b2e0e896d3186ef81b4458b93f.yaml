paperAbstract: Named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally
  required large amounts of knowledge in the form of feature engineering and lexicons
  to achieve high performance. In this paper, we present a novel neural network architecture
  that automatically detects word- and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional
  LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature engineering. We
  also propose a novel method of encoding partial lexicon matches in neural networks
  and compare it to existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given only
  tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings, our system is competitive
  on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and surpasses the previously reported state of the art
  performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.13 F1 points. By using two lexicons
  constructed from publicly-available sources, we establish new state of the art performance
  with an F1 score of 91.62 on CoNLL-2003 and 86.28 on OntoNotes, surpassing systems
  that employ heavy feature engineering, proprietary lexicons, and rich entity linking
  information.
