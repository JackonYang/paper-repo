paperAbstract: Text detection and recognition in natural images are popular yet unsolved
  problems in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a technique that attempts
  to detect and recognize text in a unified manner by searching for words directly
  without reducing the image into text regions or individual characters. We present
  three contributions. First, we modify an object detection framework called Hough
  Forests (Gall et al., 2011) by introducing "Cross-Scale Binary Features" that compares
  the information between the same image patch at different scales. We use this modified
  technique to produce likelihood maps for every text character. Second, our word-formation
  cost function and computed likelihood maps are used to detect and recognize the
  text in natural images. We test our technique with the Street View House Numbers
  (Netzer et al., 2011) and the ICDAR 2003 (Lucas et al., 2003) datasets. For the
  SVHN dataset, our algorithm outperforms recent methods and has comparable performance
  using fewer training samples. We also exceed the state-of-the-art word recognition
  performance for ICDAR 2003 dataset by 4%. Our final contribution is a realistic
  dataset generation code for text characters.
