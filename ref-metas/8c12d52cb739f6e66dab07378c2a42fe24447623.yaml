paperAbstract: Pool of knowledge available to the mankind depends on the source of
  learning resources, which can vary from ancient printed documents to present electronic
  material. The rapid conversion of material available in traditional libraries to
  digital form needs a significant amount of work if we are to maintain the format
  and the look of the electronic documents as same as their printed counterparts.
  Most of the printed documents contain not only characters and its formatting but
  also some associated non text objects such as tables, charts and graphical objects.
  It is challenging to detect them and to concentrate on the format preservation of
  the contents while reproducing them. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm
  using local thresholds for word space and line height to locate and extract all
  categories of tables from scanned document images. From the experiments performed
  on 298 documents, we conclude that our algorithm has an overall accuracy of about
  75% in detecting tables from the scanned document images. Since the algorithm does
  not completely depend on rule lines, it can detect all categories of tables in a
  range of scanned documents with different font types, styles and sizes to extract
  their formatting features. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to locate tables
  in multi column layouts with small modification in layout analysis. Treating tables
  with their existing formatting features will tremendously help the reproducing of
  printed documents for reprinting and updating purposes.
