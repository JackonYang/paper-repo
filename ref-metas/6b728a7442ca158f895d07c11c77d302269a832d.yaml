paperAbstract: 'We describe a novel method for real-time, simultaneous multi-view
  face detection and facial pose estimation. The method employs a convolutional network
  to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images
  to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function
  of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting
  system, in a single configuration, on three standard data sets - one for frontal
  pose, one for rotated faces, and one for profiles - and find that its performance
  on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle
  one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system''s accuracy
  on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks
  together.'
