paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an alternative to the Turing Test that has
  some conceptual and practical advantages. Like the original, it involves responding
  to typed English sentences, and English-speaking adults will have no difficulty
  with it. Unlike the original, the subject is not required to engage in a conversation
  and fool an interrogator into believing she is dealing with a person. Moreover,
  the test is arranged in such a way that having full access to a large corpus of
  English text might not help much. Finally, the interrogator or a third party will
  be able to decide unambiguously after a few minutes whether or not a subject has
  passed the test.
