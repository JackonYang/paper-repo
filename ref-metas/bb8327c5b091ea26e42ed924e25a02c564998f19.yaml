paperAbstract: This dissertation investigates the composition of high-quality tables
  with the use of electronic tools. A generic model is designed to support the different
  stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification
  of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates
  table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology
  and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical
  relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations
  is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract
  table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological
  rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions,
  and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items.
  The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying
  a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the
  formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical
  dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has
  been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables.
  Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented
  in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface
  to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows
  us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless
  of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting
  a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality
  layout structure.
