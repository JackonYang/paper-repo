paperAbstract: Given a static scene, a human can trivially enumerate the myriad of
  things that can happen next and characterize the relative likelihood of each. In
  the process, we make use of enormous amounts of commonsense knowledge about how
  the world works. In this paper, we investigate learning this commonsense knowledge
  from data. To overcome a lack of densely annotated spatiotemporal data, we learn
  from sequences of abstract images gathered using crowd-sourcing. The abstract scenes
  provide both object location and attribute information. We demonstrate qualitatively
  and quantitatively that our models produce plausible scene predictions on both the
  abstract images, as well as natural images taken from the Internet.
