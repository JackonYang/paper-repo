paperAbstract: We propose an approach to find and describe objects within broad domains.
  We introduce a new dataset that provides annotation for sharing models of appearance
  and correlation across categories. We use it to learn part and category detectors.
  These serve as the visual basis for an integrated model of objects. We describe
  objects by the spatial arrangement of their attributes and the interactions between
  them. Using this model, our system can find animals and vehicles that it has not
  seen and infer attributes, such as function and pose. Our experiments demonstrate
  that we can more reliably locate and describe both familiar and unfamiliar objects,
  compared to a baseline that relies purely on basic category detectors.
