paperAbstract: Probablistic models are becoming increasingly important in analyzing
  the huge amount of data being produced by large-scale DNA-sequencing efforts such
  as the Human Genome Project. For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing
  biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying
  RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies
  of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and
  self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally
  to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team
  of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians
  with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the
  state of the art in this new and important field.
