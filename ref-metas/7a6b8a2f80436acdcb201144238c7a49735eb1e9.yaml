paperAbstract: Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and
  I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set of ideas exists that
  could be called a "theory." What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of
  science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic
  growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has
  come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being
  and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent,
  and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous
  requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood
  the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity,
  uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more
  effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt
  of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing
  aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very
  long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In
  any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems
  in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content.
  He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he
  ask?
