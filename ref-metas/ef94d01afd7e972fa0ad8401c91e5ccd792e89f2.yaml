paperAbstract: This paper surveys theoretical and practical issues associated with
  a particular type of information retrieval problem, namely that where the information
  need is pictorial. The paper is contextualised by the notion of a visually stimulated
  society, in which the ease of record creation and transmission in the visual medium
  is contrasted with the difficulty of gaining effective subject access to the world's
  stores of such records. The technological developments which, in casting the visual
  image in electronic form, have contributed so significantly to its availability
  are reviewed briefly, as a prelude to the main thrust of the paper. Concentrating
  on still and moving pictorial forms of the visual image, the paper dwells on issues
  related to the subject indexing of pictorial material and discusses four models
  of pictorial information retrieval corresponding with permutations of the verbal
  and visual modes for the representation of picture content and of information need.
