paperAbstract: A scheme suitable for visual information representation in a combined
  frequency-position space is investigated through image decomposition into a finite
  set of two-dimensional Gabor elementary functions (GEF). The scheme is generalized
  to account for the position-dependent Gabor-sampling rate, oversampling, logarithmic
  frequency scaling and phase-quantization characteristic of the visual system. Comparison
  of reconstructed signal highlights the advantages of the generalized Gabor scheme
  in coding typical bandlimited images. It is shown that there exists a tradeoff between
  the number of frequency components used per position and the number of such clusters
  (sampling rate) utilized along the spatial coordinate. >
