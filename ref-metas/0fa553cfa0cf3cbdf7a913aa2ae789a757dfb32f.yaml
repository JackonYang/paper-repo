paperAbstract: This paper presents a speech recognition system that directly transcribes
  audio data with text, without requiring an intermediate phonetic representation.
  The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural
  network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function.
  A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to
  minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows
  a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or
  language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street
  Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of
  allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with
  a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%.
