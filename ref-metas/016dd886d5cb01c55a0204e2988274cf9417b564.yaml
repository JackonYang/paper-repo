paperAbstract: 'Typical approaches to articulated pose estimation combine spatial
  modelling of the human body with appearance modelling of body parts. This paper
  aims to push the state-of-the-art in articulated pose estimation in two ways. First
  we explore various types of appearance representations aiming to substantially improve
  the body part hypotheses. And second, we draw on and combine several recently proposed
  powerful ideas such as more flexible spatial models as well as image-conditioned
  spatial models. In a series of experiments we draw several important conclusions:
  (1) we show that the proposed appearance representations are complementary, (2)
  we demonstrate that even a basic tree-structure spatial human body model achieves
  state-of-the-art performance when augmented with the proper appearance representation,
  and (3) we show that the combination of the best performing appearance model with
  a flexible image-conditioned spatial model achieves the best result, significantly
  improving over the state of the art, on the ``Leeds Sports Poses'''' and ``Parse''''
  benchmarks.'
