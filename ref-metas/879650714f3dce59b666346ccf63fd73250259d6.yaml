paperAbstract: A general discussion of ideas and definitions relating to self-organizing
  systems and their synthesis is given, together with remarks concerning their simulation
  by digital computer. Synthesis and simulation of an actual system is then described.
  This system, initially randomly organized within wide limits, organizes itself to
  perform a simple prescribed task.
