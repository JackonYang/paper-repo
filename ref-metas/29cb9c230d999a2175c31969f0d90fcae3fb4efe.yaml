paperAbstract: 'We present a model of human preattentive texture perception. This
  model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric
  linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling
  outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among
  the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when
  there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary
  detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience
  of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation
  of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical
  literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different
  texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human
  observers.'
