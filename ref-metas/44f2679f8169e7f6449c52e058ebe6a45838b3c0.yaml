paperAbstract: "Threshold functions and related operators are widely used as basic\
  \ elements of adaptive and associative networks [Nakano 72, Amari 72, Hopfield 82].\
  \ There exist numerous learning rules for finding a set of weights to achieve a\
  \ particular correspondence between input-output pairs. But early works in the field\
  \ have shown that the number of threshold functions (or linearly separable functions)\
  \ in N binary variables is small compared to the number of all possible boolean\
  \ mappings in N variables, especially if N is large. This problem is one of the\
  \ main limitations of most neural networks models where the state is fully specified\
  \ by the environment during learning: they can only learn linearly separable functions\
  \ of their inputs. Moreover, a learning procedure which requires the outside world\
  \ to specify the state of every neuron during the learning session can hardly be\
  \ considered as a general learning rule because in real-world conditions, only a\
  \ partial information on the \u201Cideal\u201D network state for each task is available\
  \ from the environment. It is possible to use a set of so-called \u201Chidden units\u201D\
  \ [Hinton,Sejnowski,Ackley. 84], without direct interaction with the environment,\
  \ which can compute intermediate predicates. Unfortunately, the global response\
  \ depends on the output of a particular hidden unit in a highly non-linear way,\
  \ moreover the nature of this dependence is influenced by the states of the other\
  \ cells."
