paperAbstract: 'An automatic bitmap-level, set-based benchmarking scheme for page
  segmentation, comparing results with predefined `ground truth files'' containing
  all the possible correct solutions, is presented. A successful page segmentation
  is a necessary precondition for a document recognition process to be successful.
  The problems addressed here are: design methods to describe all possible correct
  segmentations for a given page and design methods to compare two segmentations.
  The proposed segmentation ground truth representation scheme defines ground truth
  text regions as non-mergeable maximal sets of text lines, merged in a language-
  dependent direction. It includes the other possible correct segmentations in that
  authorized cuts in the region are explicitly specified. At this low-level stage,
  quality criteria for a page segmentation are mainly defined as providing correct
  input for region ordering and classification. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation
  method tests the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are
  defined as being the black pixels contained in the derived polygons.'
