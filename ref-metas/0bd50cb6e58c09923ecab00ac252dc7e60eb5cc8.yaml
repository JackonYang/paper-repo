paperAbstract: The growing demand for structured knowledge has led to great interest
  in relation extraction, especially in cases with limited supervision. However, existing
  distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in single sentences.
  In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is under-explored, even in the supervised-learning
  setting. In this paper, we propose the first approach for applying distant supervision
  to cross-sentence relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation
  that can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus providing
  a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We extract features
  from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and robustness when confronted
  with linguistic variation and analysis error. Experiments on an important extraction
  task for precision medicine show that our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence
  extractor, using only a small existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical
  research articles. Compared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach
  extracted twice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence
  of cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.
