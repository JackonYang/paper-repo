paperAbstract: 'This paper discusses how local measurements of positions and surface
  normals may be used to identify and locate overlapping objects. The objects are
  modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom
  relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about
  pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent
  ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face
  normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed
  points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and
  localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15].'
