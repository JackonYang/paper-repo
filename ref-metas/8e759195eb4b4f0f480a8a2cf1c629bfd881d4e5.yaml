paperAbstract: "Recently, a number of deep-learning based models have been proposed\
  \ for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). The performance of most models\
  \ is clustered around 60-70%. In this paper we propose systematic methods to analyze\
  \ the behavior of these models as a first step towards recognizing their strengths\
  \ and weaknesses, and identifying the most fruitful directions for progress. We\
  \ analyze two models, one each from two major classes of VQA models -- with-attention\
  \ and without-attention and show the similarities and differences in the behavior\
  \ of these models. We also analyze the winning entry of the VQA Challenge 2016.\
  \ \nOur behavior analysis reveals that despite recent progress, today's VQA models\
  \ are \"myopic\" (tend to fail on sufficiently novel instances), often \"jump to\
  \ conclusions\" (converge on a predicted answer after 'listening' to just half the\
  \ question), and are \"stubborn\" (do not change their answers across images)."
