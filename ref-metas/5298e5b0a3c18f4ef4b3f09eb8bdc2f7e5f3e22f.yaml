paperAbstract: By applying semantic analysis to images of extended passages of text,
  several volumes of a chess encyclopedia have been read with high accuracy. Although
  carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge
  to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental
  page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification
  of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks
  to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching,
  and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic
  search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions
  and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from
  what was achievable through shape analysis alone. Several computer vision systems
  integration issues suggested by this experience are discussed. >
