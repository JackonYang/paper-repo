paperAbstract: "In this article, we describe an automatic differentiation module of\
  \ PyTorch \u2014 a library designed to enable rapid research on machine learning\
  \ models. It builds upon a few projects, most notably Lua Torch, Chainer, and HIPS\
  \ Autograd [4], and provides a high performance environment with easy access to\
  \ automatic differentiation of models executed on different devices (CPU and GPU).\
  \ To make prototyping easier, PyTorch does not follow the symbolic approach used\
  \ in many other deep learning frameworks, but focuses on differentiation of purely\
  \ imperative programs, with a focus on extensibility and low overhead. Note that\
  \ this preprint is a draft of certain sections from an upcoming paper covering all\
  \ PyTorch features."
