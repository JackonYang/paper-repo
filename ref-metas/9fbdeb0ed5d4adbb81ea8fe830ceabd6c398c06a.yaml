paperAbstract: "\n \n In digital libraries, a table, as a specific document component\
  \ as well as a condensed way to present structured and relational data, contains\
  \ rich information and often the only source of .that information. In order to explore,\
  \ retrieve, and reuse that data, tables should be identified and the data extracted.\
  \ Table recognition is an old field of research. However, due to the diversity of\
  \ table styles, the results are still far from satisfactory, and not a single algorithm\
  \ performs well on all different types of tables. In this paper, we randomly take\
  \ samples from the CiteSeerX to investigate diverse table styles for automatic table\
  \ extraction. We find that table headers are one of the main characteristics of\
  \ complex table styles. We identify a set of features that can be used to segregate\
  \ headers from tabular data and build a classifier to detect table headers. Our\
  \ empirical evaluation on PDF documents shows that using a Random Forest classifier\
  \ achieves an accuracy of 92%.\n \n"
