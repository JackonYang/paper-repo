paperAbstract: 'This classic work on cyclopean perception has influenced a generation
  of vision researchers, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists and has inspired
  artists, designers, and computer graphics pioneers. In Foundations of Cyclopean
  Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced
  the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate
  images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed
  novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early
  digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses
  that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode
  of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This
  reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well
  as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception
  has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one
  of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted
  by the University of Minnesota''s Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are
  "permanently borrowed" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online.
  Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive
  scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers.'
