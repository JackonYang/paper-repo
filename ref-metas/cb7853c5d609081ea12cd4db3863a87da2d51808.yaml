paperAbstract: "A\_plausible definition of \u201Creasoning\u201D could be \u201Calgebraically\
  \ manipulating previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question\u201D\
  . This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference.\
  \ It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning\
  \ systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by\
  \ first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a\
  \ language model, using appropriate labelled training sets. Adequately concatenating\
  \ these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic\
  \ operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that\
  \ is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.This observation\
  \ suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems,\
  \ such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as\
  \ the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying\
  \ to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated \u201Call-purpose\u201D\
  \ inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations\
  \ applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground\
  \ up."
