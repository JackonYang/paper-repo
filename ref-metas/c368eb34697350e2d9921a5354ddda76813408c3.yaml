paperAbstract: "This paper address the problems of modeling the appearance of humans\
  \ and distinguishing human appearance from the appearance of general scenes. We\
  \ seek a model of appearance and motion that is generic in that it accounts for\
  \ the ways in which people's appearance varies and, at the same time, is specific\
  \ enough to be useful for tracking people in natural scenes. Given a 3D model of\
  \ the person projected into an image we model the likelihood of observing various\
  \ image cues conditioned on the predicted locations and orientations of the limbs.\
  \ These cues are taken to be steered filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges,\
  \ and motion-compensated temporal differences. Motivated by work on the statistics\
  \ of natural scenes, the statistics of these filter responses for human limbs are\
  \ learned from training images containing hand-labeled limb regions. Similarly,\
  \ the statistics of the filter responses in general scenes are learned to define\
  \ a \u201Cbackground\u201D distribution. The likelihood of observing a scene given\
  \ a predicted pose of a person is computed, for each limb, using the likelihood\
  \ ratio between the learned foreground (person) and background distributions. Adopting\
  \ a Bayesian formulation allows cues to be combined in a principled way. Furthermore,\
  \ the use of learned distributions obviates the need for hand-tuned image noise\
  \ models and thresholds. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the statistics\
  \ of how people appear in scenes and provides a connection between work on natural\
  \ image statistics and the Bayesian tracking of people."
