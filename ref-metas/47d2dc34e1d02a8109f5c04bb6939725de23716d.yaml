paperAbstract: 'We replace the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is traditionally used
  in in continuous speech recognition with a bi-directional recurrent neural network
  encoder coupled to a recurrent neural network decoder that directly emits a stream
  of phonemes. The alignment between the input and output sequences is established
  using an attention mechanism: the decoder emits each symbol based on a context created
  with a subset of input symbols elected by the attention mechanism. We report initial
  results demonstrating that this new approach achieves phoneme error rates that are
  comparable to the state-of-the-art HMM-based decoders, on the TIMIT dataset.'
