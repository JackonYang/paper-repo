paperAbstract: "Since at most T of these equations can come from (7), at least (m\
  \ T) of them come from (8\u2019). Thus, for the distribution (PI\u2019, . . . ,\
  \ p,\u2018), at most T of the probabilities are nonzero. The proof of our contention\
  \ now follows by letting plo, . . . , 10~0 in the above argument be a distribution\
  \ for which channel capacity is attained. It should be remarked that this proof\
  \ provides (via the Simplex Method of linear programming) a means for reducing any\
  \ transmitter with more than r symbols, to another, equally good or better, with\
  \ at most T symbols. For a discussion of the possibility of reducing the number\
  \ of receiver symbols, see Feinstein.5"
