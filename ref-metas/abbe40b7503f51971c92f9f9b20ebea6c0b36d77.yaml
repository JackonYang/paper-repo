paperAbstract: 'This paper presents an application of nonlinear neural networks to
  topic spotting. Neural networks allow us to model higher-order interaction between
  document terms and to simultaneously predict multiple topics using shared hidden
  features. In the context of this model, we compare two approaches to dimensionality
  reduction in representation: one based on term selection and another based on Latent
  Semantic Indexing (LSI). Two diierent methods are proposed for improving LSI representations
  for the topic spotting task. We nd that term selection and our modiied LSI representations
  lead to similar topic spotting performance, and that this performance is equal to
  or better than other published results on the same corpus.'
