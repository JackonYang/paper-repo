paperAbstract: "Internal models of the environment have an important role to play\
  \ in adaptive systems, in general, and are of particular importance for the supervised\
  \ learning paradigm. In this article we demonstrate that certain classical problems\
  \ associated with the notion of the \u201Cteacher\u201D in supervised learning can\
  \ be solved by judicious use of learned internal models as components of the adaptive\
  \ system. In particular, we show how supervised learning algorithms can be utilized\
  \ in cases in which an unknown dynamical system intervenes between actions and desired\
  \ outcomes. Our approach applies to any supervised learning algorithm that is capable\
  \ of learning in multilayer networks."
