paperAbstract: We report on results of training backpropagation nets with samples
  of hand-printed digits scanned off of bank checks and hand-printed letters interactively
  entered into a computer through a stylus digitizer. Generalization results are reported
  as a function of training set size and network capacity. Given a large training
  set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training
  set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at
  a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number
  of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For
  those developing hand-printed character recognition systems, these results suggest
  that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important
  factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. Benefits of reducing the number of
  net connections, other than improving generalization, are discussed.
