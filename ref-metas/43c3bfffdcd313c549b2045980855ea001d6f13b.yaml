paperAbstract: Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description
  of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing
  interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the
  methods that are best suited to practical problems. For this new edition the book
  has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior
  methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely
  in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical
  methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible
  to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations
  research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook
  for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce
  a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both
  the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.
