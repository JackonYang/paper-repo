paperAbstract: 'A system for isolating blocks, lines, words, and symbols within images
  of machine-printed textual documents that is, to a large existent, independent of
  language and writing system is described. This is achieved by exploiting a small
  number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not
  require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well
  with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks
  of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown
  or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers
  text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol
  set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols,
  and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language:
  this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms
  are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry,
  and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms
  that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum).
  The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents
  is discussed.<<ETX>>'
