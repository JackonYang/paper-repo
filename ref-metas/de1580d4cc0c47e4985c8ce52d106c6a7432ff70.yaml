paperAbstract: The design of a comprehensive standard document database for machine-printed
  documents is presented. The effort to produce a series of carefully ground-truthed
  document databases to be issued on CD-ROMs is described in detail. The databases
  can be utilized by the OCR and document understanding community as a common platform
  to develop, test, and evaluate their algorithms.<<ETX>>
