paperAbstract: "We characterize some properties of the zero crossings of the Laplacian\
  \ of signals\xBFin particular images\xBFfiltered with linear filters, as a function\
  \ of the scale of the filter (extending recent work by Witkin [16]). We prove that\
  \ in any dimension the only filter that does not create generic zero crossings as\
  \ the scale increases is the Gaussian. This result can be generalized to apply to\
  \ level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular\
  \ to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative\
  \ along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings,\
  \ unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied."
