paperAbstract: In this paper we show that a geometric representation of an object
  occurring in indoor scenes, along with rich scene structure can be used to produce
  a detector for that object in a single image. Using perspective cues from the global
  scene geometry, we first develop a 3D based object detector. This detector is competitive
  with an image based detector built using state-of-the-art methods; however, combining
  the two produces a notably improved detector, because it unifies contextual and
  geometric information. We then use a probabilistic model that explicitly uses constraints
  imposed by spatial layout - the locations of walls and floor in the image - to refine
  the 3D object estimates. We use an existing approach to compute spatial layout [1],
  and use constraints such as objects are supported by floor and can not stick through
  the walls. The resulting detector (a) has significantly improved accuracy when compared
  to the state-of-the-art 2D detectors and (b) gives a 3D interpretation of the location
  of the object, derived from a 2D image. We evaluate the detector on beds, for which
  we give extensive quantitative results derived from images of real scenes.
