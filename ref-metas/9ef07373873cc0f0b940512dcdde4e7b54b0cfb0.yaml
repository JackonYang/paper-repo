paperAbstract: Manually querying search engines in order to accumulate a large bodyof
  factual information is a tedious, error-prone process of piecemealsearch. Search
  engines retrieve and rank potentially relevantdocuments for human perusal, but do
  not extract facts, assessconfidence, or fuse information from multiple documents.
  This paperintroduces KnowItAll, a system that aims to automate the tedious process
  ofextracting large collections of facts from the web in an autonomous,domain-independent,
  and scalable manner.The paper describes preliminary experiments in which an instance
  of KnowItAll, running for four days on a single machine, was able to automatically
  extract 54,753 facts. KnowItAll associates a probability with each fact enabling
  it to trade off precision and recall. The paper analyzes KnowItAll's architecture
  and reports on lessons learned for the design of large-scale information extraction
  systems.
