paperAbstract: Recently, several learning algorithms relying on models with deep architectures
  have been proposed. Though they have demonstrated impressive performance, to date,
  they have only been evaluated on relatively simple problems such as digit recognition
  in a controlled environment, for which many machine learning algorithms already
  report reasonable results. Here, we present a series of experiments which indicate
  that these models show promise in solving harder learning problems that exhibit
  many factors of variation. These models are compared with well-established algorithms
  such as Support Vector Machines and single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks.
