paperAbstract: Visual scene understanding is a difficult problem interleaving object
  detection, geometric reasoning and scene classification. We present a hierarchical
  scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally
  tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids
  oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model
  which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects which frequently
  co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration. Experiments show that this model
  effectively explains scene semantics, geometry and object groupings from a single
  image, while also improving individual object detections.
