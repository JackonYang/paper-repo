paperAbstract: The ICDAR Robust Reading Competition (RRC), initiated in 2003 and re-established
  in 2011, has become a de-facto evaluation standard for robust reading systems and
  algorithms. Concurrent with its second incarnation in 2011, a continuous effort
  started to develop an on-line framework to facilitate the hosting and management
  of competitions. This paper outlines the Robust Reading Competition Annotation and
  Evaluation Platform, the backbone of the competitions. The RRC Annotation and Evaluation
  Platform is a modular framework, fully accessible through on-line interfaces. It
  comprises a collection of tools and services for managing all processes involved
  with defining and evaluating a research task, from dataset definition to annotation
  management, evaluation specification and results analysis. Although the framework
  has been designed with robust reading research in mind, many of the provided tools
  are generic by design. All aspects of the RRC Annotation and Evaluation Framework
  are available for research use.
