paperAbstract: A crucial issue in triphone based continuous speech recognition is
  the large number of models to be estimated against the limited availability of training
  data. This problem can be relieved by composing a triphone model from less context-dependent
  models. This paper introduces a new statistical framework, derived from the Bayesian
  principle, to perform such a composition. The potential power of this new framework
  is explored, both algorithmically and experimentally, by an implementation with
  hidden Markov modeling techniques. This implementation is applied to the recognition
  of the 39-phone set on the TIMIT database. The new model achieves 74.4% and 75.6%
  accuracy, respectively, on the core and complete test sets.
