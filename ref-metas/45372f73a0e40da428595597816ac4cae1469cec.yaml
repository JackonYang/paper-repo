paperAbstract: Promising approaches to structured learning problems have recently
  been developed in the maximum margin framework. Unfortunately, algorithms that are
  computationally and memory efficient enough to solve large scale problems have lagged
  behind. We propose using simple subgradient-based techniques for optimizing a regularized
  risk formulation of these problems in both online and batch settings, and analyze
  the theoretical convergence, generalization, and robustness properties of the resulting
  techniques. These algorithms are are simple, memory efficient, fast to converge,
  and have small regret in the online setting. We also investigate a novel convex
  regression formulation of structured learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits
  of the subgradient approach on three structured prediction problems.
