paperAbstract: Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and
  bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become
  interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards
  (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as
  French and English). One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify
  correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This
  paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based
  on a simple statistical model of character lengths. The program uses the fact that
  longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in
  the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter
  sentences. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of
  sentences, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two sentences (in characters)
  and the variance of this difference. This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic
  programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.It is
  remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does. An evaluation was
  performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank
  of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned
  all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus
  that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments,
  the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French
  subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend
  on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method
  will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora,
  a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half
  in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will
  be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational
  Linguistics (ACL/DCI). In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align
  program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core
  of the align program.
