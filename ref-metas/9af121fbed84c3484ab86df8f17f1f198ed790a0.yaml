paperAbstract: "The time-frequency and time-scale communities have recently developed\
  \ a large number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries --- stationary wavelets,\
  \ wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition\
  \ into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition\
  \ have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), Matching pursuit (MP),\
  \ and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). \nBasis Pursuit\
  \ (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an \"optimal\" superposition\
  \ of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients\
  \ among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages\
  \ over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting\
  \ relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract harmonic\
  \ analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising. \nBP in highly\
  \ overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals\
  \ of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear\
  \ program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only\
  \ because of recent advances in linear programming by interior-point methods. We\
  \ obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient\
  \ solver."
