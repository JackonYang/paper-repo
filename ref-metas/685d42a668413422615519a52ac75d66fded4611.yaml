paperAbstract: In this paper, we apply bidirectional training to a long short term
  memory (LSTM) network for the first time. We also present a modified, full gradient
  version of the LSTM learning algorithm. We discuss the significance of framewise
  phoneme classification to continuous speech recognition, and the validity of using
  bidirectional networks for online causal tasks. On the TIMIT speech database, we
  measure the framewise phoneme classification scores of bidirectional and unidirectional
  variants of both LSTM and conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We find
  that bidirectional LSTM outperforms both RNNs and unidirectional LSTM.
