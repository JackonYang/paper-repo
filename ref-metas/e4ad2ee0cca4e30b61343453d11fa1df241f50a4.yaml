paperAbstract: 'Abstract. This paper presents an end-to-end system for reading handwritten
  page images. Five functional modules included in the system are introduced in this
  paper: (i) pre-processing, which concerns introducing an image representation for
  easy manipulation of large page images and image handling procedures using the image
  representation; (ii) line separation, concerning text line detection and extracting
  images of lines of text from a page image; (iii) word segmentation, which concerns
  locating word gaps and isolating words from a line of text image obtained efficiently
  and in an intelligent manner; (iv) word recognition, concerning handwritten word
  recognition algorithms; and (v) linguistic post-pro- cessing, which concerns the
  use of linguistic constraints to intelligently parse and recognize text. Key ideas
  employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the
  diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability
  and robustness, are described in this paper. Preliminary experiments show promising
  results in terms of speed and accuracy.'
