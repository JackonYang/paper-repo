paperAbstract: "It is shown that a convolution with certain reasonable receptive field\
  \ (RF) profiles yields the exact partial derivatives of the retinal illuminance\
  \ blurred to a specified degree. Arbitrary concatenations of such RF profiles yield\
  \ again similar ones of higher order and for a greater degree of blurring.By replacing\
  \ the illuminance with its third order jet extension we obtain position dependent\
  \ geometries. It is shown how such a representation can function as the substrate\
  \ for \u201Cpoint processors\u201D computing geometrical features such as edge curvature.\
  \ We obtain a clear dichotomy between local and multilocal visual routines. The\
  \ terms of the truncated Taylor series representing the jets are partial derivatives\
  \ whose corresponding RF profiles closely mimic the well known units in the primary\
  \ visual cortex. Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and\
  \ classify these units.Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input data\
  \ one may devise visual routines that compute geometric features on the basis of\
  \ standard differential geometry exploiting the equivalence with the local jets\
  \ (partial derivatives with respect to the space coordinates)."
