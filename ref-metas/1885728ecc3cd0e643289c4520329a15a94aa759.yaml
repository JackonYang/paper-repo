paperAbstract: 'Model order selection and cue combination are both difficult open
  problems in the area of clustering. In this work we build upon stability-based approaches
  to develop a new method for automatic model order selection and cue combination
  with applications to visual grouping. Novel features of our approach include the
  ability to detect multiple stable clusterings (instead of only one), a simpler means
  of calculating stability that does not require training a classifier, and a new
  characterization of the space of stabilities for a continuum of segmentations that
  provides for an efficient sampling scheme. Our contribution is a framework for visual
  grouping that frees the user from the hassles of parameter tuning and model order
  selection: the input is an image, the output is a shortlist of segmentations.'
