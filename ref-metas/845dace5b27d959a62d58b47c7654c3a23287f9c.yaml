paperAbstract: Textual information in images and video frames constitutes a valuable
  source of high-level semantics for multimedia indexing and retrieval systems. Text
  detection is the most crucial step in a multimedia text extraction system and although
  it has been extensively studied the past decade still, it does not exist a generic
  architecture that would work for artificial and scene text in multimedia content.
  In this paper we propose a system for text detection of both artificial and scene
  text in images and video frames. The system is based on a machine learning stage
  which uses an Random Forest classifier and a highly discriminative feature set produced
  by using a new texture operator called Multilevel Adaptive Color edge Local Binary
  Pattern (MACeLBP). MACeLBP describes the spatial distribution of color edges in
  multiple adaptive levels of contrast. Then, a gradient-based algorithm is applied
  to achieve distinction among text lines as well as refinement in the localization
  of the text lines. The whole algorithm is situated in a multiresolution framework
  to achieve invariance to scale for the detection of text lines. Finally, an optional
  connected-component step segments text lines into words based on the distances between
  the resulting components. The experimental results are produced by applying a concise
  evaluation methodology and prove the superior performance achieved by the proposed
  text detection system for artificial and scene text in images and video frames.
