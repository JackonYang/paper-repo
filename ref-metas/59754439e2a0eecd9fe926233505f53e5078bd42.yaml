paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new class of distinguished regions based on detecting
  the most salient convex local arrangements of contours in the image. The regions
  are used in a similar way to the local interest points extracted from gray-level
  images, but they capture shape rather than texture. Local convexity is characterized
  by measuring the extent to which the detected image contours support circle or arc-like
  local structures at each position and scale in the image. Our saliency measure combines
  two cost functions defined on the tangential edges near the circle: a tangential-gradient
  energy term, and an entropy term that ensures local support from a wide range of
  angular positions around the circle. The detected regions are invariant to scale
  changes and rotations, and robust against clutter, occlusions and spurious edge
  detections. Experimental results show very good performance for both shape matching
  and recognition of object categories.'
