paperAbstract: 'We propose to use text recognition to aid in visual object class recognition.
  To this end we first propose a new algorithm for text detection in natural images.
  The proposed text detection is based on saliency cues and a context fusion step.
  The algorithm does not need any parameter tuning and can deal with varying imaging
  conditions. We evaluate three different tasks: 1. Scene text recognition, where
  we increase the state-of-the-art by 0.17 on the ICDAR 2003 dataset. 2. Saliency
  based object recognition, where we outperform other state-of-the-art saliency methods
  for object recognition on the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset. 3. Object recognition with
  the aid of recognized text, where we are the first to report multi-modal results
  on the IMET set. Results show that text helps for object class recognition if the
  text is not uniquely coupled to individual object instances.'
