paperAbstract: Recent work on deep neural networks as acoustic models for automatic
  speech recognition (ASR) have demonstrated substantial performance improvements.
  We introduce a model which uses a deep recurrent auto encoder neural network to
  denoise input features for robust ASR. The model is trained on stereo (noisy and
  clean) audio features to predict clean features given noisy input. The model makes
  no assumptions about how noise affects the signal, nor the existence of distinct
  noise environments. Instead, the model can learn to model any type of distortion
  or additive noise given sufficient training data. We demonstrate the model is competitive
  with existing feature denoising approaches on the Aurora2 task, and outperforms
  a tandem approach where deep networks are used to predict phoneme posteriors directly.
