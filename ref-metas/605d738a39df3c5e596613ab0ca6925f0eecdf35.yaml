paperAbstract: 'AbstractIn this paper three problems for a connectionist account of
  language are considered1.What is the nature of linguistic representations?2.How
  can complex structural relationships such as constituent be represented?3.How can
  the apparently open-ended nature of language be accommodated by a fixed-resource
  system?

  Using a prediction task, a simple recurrent network (SRN) is trained on multiclausal
  sentences which contain multiply-embedded relative clauses. Principal component
  analysis of the hidden unit activation patterns reveals that the network solves
  the task by developing complex distributed representations which encode the relevant
  grammatical relations and hierarchical constituent structure. Differences between
  the SRN state representations and the more traditional pushdown store are discussed
  in the final section.'
