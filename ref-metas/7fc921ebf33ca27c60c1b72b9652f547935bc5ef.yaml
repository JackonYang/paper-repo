paperAbstract: We present two solutions for the scale selection problem in computer
  vision. The first one is completely nonparametric and is based on the the adaptive
  estimation of the normalized density gradient. Employing the sample point estimator,
  we define the Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift, prove its convergence, and show its
  superiority over the fixed bandwidth procedure. The second technique has a semiparametric
  nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information.
  The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes
  the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Both estimators provide practical
  tools for autonomous image and quasi real-time video analysis and several examples
  are shown to illustrate their effectiveness.
