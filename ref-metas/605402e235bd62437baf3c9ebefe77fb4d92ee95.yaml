paperAbstract: Discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental
  aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized
  stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce
  the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated
  in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize
  the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial
  explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the
  observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised
  learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing
  pathways.
