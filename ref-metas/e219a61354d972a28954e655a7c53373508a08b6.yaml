paperAbstract: Past empirical work has shown that learning multiple related tasks
  from data simultaneously can be advantageous in terms of predictive performance
  relative to learning these tasks independently. In this paper we present an approach
  to multi--task learning based on the minimization of regularization functionals
  similar to existing ones, such as the one for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), that
  have been successfully used in the past for single--task learning. Our approach
  allows to model the relation between tasks in terms of a novel kernel function that
  uses a task--coupling parameter. We implement an instance of the proposed approach
  similar to SVMs and test it empirically using simulated as well as real data. The
  experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than existing
  multi--task learning methods and largely outperforms single--task learning using
  SVMs.
