paperAbstract: In this paper we describe a flexible approach for determining the relative
  orientation of the camera with respect to the scene. The main premise of the approach
  is the fact that in man-made environments, the majority of lines is aligned with
  the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We exploit this
  observation towards efficient detection and estimation of vanishing points, which
  provide strong constraints on camera parameters and relative orientation of the
  camera with respect to the scene.By combining efficient image processing techniques
  in the line detection and initialization stage we demonstrate that simultaneous
  grouping and estimation of vanishing directions can be achieved in the absence of
  internal parameters of the camera. Constraints between vanishing points are then
  used for partial calibration and relative rotation estimation. The algorithm has
  been tested in a variety of indoors and outdoors scenes and its efficiency and automation
  makes it amenable for implementation on robotic platforms.
