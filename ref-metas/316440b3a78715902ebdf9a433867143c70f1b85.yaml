paperAbstract: This paper describes a project in which an analysis was undertaken
  of user queries addressed to seven libraries which manage archives of widely varying
  still and moving image material. The sampling procedure is described, in which queries
  obtained from each library were broadly categorised by image content, identification
  and accessibility. Attention is focused on the image content requests, for which
  a categorisation based on facet analysis is developed. The analytical tool which
  is used for this purpose is based on a schema already well established for the analysis
  of levels of meaning in images. The project demonstrates the possibility of formulating
  a general categorisation of requests which seek widely different still and moving
  image material. The paper concludes with observations on the potential value of
  embedding such a schema within the user interface of unmediated-query visual information
  retrieval systems.
