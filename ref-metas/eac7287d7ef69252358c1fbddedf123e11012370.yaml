paperAbstract: A common method for real-time segmentation of moving regions in image
  sequences involves "background subtraction", or thresholding the error between an
  estimate of the image without moving objects and the current image. The numerous
  approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure
  used to update the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture
  of Gaussians and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The Gaussian,
  distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then evaluated to determine which
  are most likely to result from a background process. Each pixel is classified based
  on whether the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively is considered
  part of the background model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker
  which reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and
  long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously for 16 months,
  24 hours a day, through rain and snow.
