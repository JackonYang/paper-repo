paperAbstract: Superior to state-of-the-art approaches which compete performances
  of table recognition on 67 annotated government documents released by ICDAR 2013
  Table Competition, this paper contributes a novel paradigm on large-scale unlabeled
  PDF files. We integrate the paradigm into our latest developed system (PdfExtra)
  to detect the region of tables by means of 9,466 academic articles from the entire
  repository of ACL Anthology, where almost all papers are archived by PDF format
  without annotation. The paradigm first adopts heuristics to automatically construct
  weakly labeled data, then feeds diverse evidences, such as font-styles, layouts
  and even linguistic features extracted by Apache PDFBox and processed by Stanford
  NLP toolkit, into different canonical classifiers, and finally uses these models
  to collaboratively vote on the boundary of tables. Experimental results show that
  PdfExtra performs a great leap forward, compared with the state-ofthe-arts. Moreover,
  we discuss the factors of different features, learning models and even domains that
  may impact the performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our paradigm
  is compatible enough to leverage various features and learning models for cross-domain
  table region detection.
