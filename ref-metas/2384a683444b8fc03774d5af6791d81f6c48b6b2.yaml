paperAbstract: Two different procedures for effecting a frequency analysis of a time-dependent
  signal locally in time are studied. The first procedure is the short-time or windowed
  Fourier transform; the second is the wavelet transform, in which high-frequency
  components are studied with sharper time resolution than low-frequency components.
  The similarities and the differences between these two methods are discussed. For
  both schemes a detailed study is made of the reconstruction method and its stability
  as a function of the chosen time-frequency density. Finally, the notion of time-frequency
  localization is made precise, within this framework, by two localization theorems.
