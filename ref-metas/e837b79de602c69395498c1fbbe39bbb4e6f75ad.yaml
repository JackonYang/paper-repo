paperAbstract: Recently, strong results have been demonstrated by Deep Recurrent Neural
  Networks on natural language transduction problems. In this paper we explore the
  representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to exhibit
  phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as machine translation.
  These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recurrent networks that implement
  continuously differentiable analogues of traditional data structures such as Stacks,
  Queues, and DeQues. We show that these architectures exhibit superior generalisation
  performance to Deep RNNs and are often able to learn the underlying generating algorithms
  in our transduction experiments.
