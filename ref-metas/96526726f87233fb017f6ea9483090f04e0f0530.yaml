paperAbstract: We present extensions to a continuousstate dependency parsing method
  that makes it applicable to morphologically rich languages. Starting with a highperformance
  transition-based parser that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
  networks to learn representations of the parser state, we replace lookup-based word
  representations with representations constructed from the orthographic representations
  of the words, also using LSTMs. This allows statistical sharing across word forms
  that are similar on the surface. Experiments for morphologically rich languages
  show that the parsing model benefits from incorporating the character-based encodings
  of words.
