paperAbstract: Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization
  have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences. For longer documents
  and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases.
  We introduce a neural network model with a novel intra-attention that attends over
  the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method
  that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL).
  Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit "exposure bias" - they
  assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard
  word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the
  resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily
  Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the
  CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. Human
  evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.
