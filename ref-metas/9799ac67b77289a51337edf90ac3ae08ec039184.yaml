paperAbstract: "The present paper presents a model for texture discrimination based\
  \ on Gabor functions. In this model the Gabor power spectrum of the micropatterns\
  \ corresponding to different textures is calculated. A function that measures the\
  \ difference between the spectrum of two micropatterns is introduced and its values\
  \ are correlated with human performance in preattentive detection tasks. In addition,\
  \ a two stage algorithm for texture segregation is presented. In the first stage\
  \ the input image is transformed via Gabor filters into a representation image that\
  \ allows discrimination between features by means of intensity differences. In the\
  \ second stage the borders between areas of different textures are found using a\
  \ Laplacian of Gaussian operator. This algorithm is sensitive to energy differences,\
  \ rotation and spatial frequency and is insensitive to local translation. The model\
  \ was tested by means of several simulations and was found to be in good correlation\
  \ with known psychophysical characteristics as texton based texture segregation\
  \ and micropattern density sensitivity. However, this simple model fails to predict\
  \ human performance in discrimination tasks based on differences in the density\
  \ of \u201Cterminators\u201D. In this case human performance is better than expected."
