paperAbstract: This paper presents a comparison between three classifiers based on
  Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Gaussian Mixture Models respectively
  to detect physical structure of historical documents. Each classifier segments a
  scaled image of historical document into four classes, i.e., areas of periphery,
  background, text and decoration. We evaluate them on three data sets of historical
  documents. Depending on data sets, the best classification rates obtained vary from
  90.35% to 97.47%.
