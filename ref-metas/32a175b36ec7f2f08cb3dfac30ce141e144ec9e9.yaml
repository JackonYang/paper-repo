paperAbstract: Statistical methods useful in automatic recognition of continuous speech
  are described. They concern modeling of a speaker and of an acoustic processor,
  extraction of the models' statistical parameters and hypothesis search procedures
  and likelihood computations of linguistic decoding. Experimental results are presented
  that indicate the power of the methods.
