paperAbstract: In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the
  macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased
  even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical
  areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database
  for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns,
  and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization
  of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes
  25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus
  an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of
  their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual
  and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible
  number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree
  of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve
  reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with
  cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex,
  as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal
  and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways
  linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based
  on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of
  visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those
  suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes
  10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes
  the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal
  cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined
  processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization
  of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between
  processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways
  and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly
  into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though,
  it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather
  than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.
