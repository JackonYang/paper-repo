paperAbstract: 'Human linguistic annotation is crucial for many natural language processing
  tasks but can be expensive and time-consuming. We explore the use of Amazon''s Mechanical
  Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations
  from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five
  tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event
  temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement
  between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels
  provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that
  using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective
  as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias
  correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude
  that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this
  method at a fraction of the usual expense.'
