paperAbstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical
  modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families
  and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein
  kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the
  parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After
  the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training
  sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences
  that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM
  produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments
  produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information.
  When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in
  a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish
  members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both
  the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between
  a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests
  than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to
  have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives
  and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences,
  whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the
  presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary
  preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of
  L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling.
  This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical
  or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to
  ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.
