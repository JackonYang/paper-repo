paperAbstract: 'In this work we resolve the long-outstanding problem of how to effectively
  train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on complex and difficult sequence modeling
  problems which may contain long-term data dependencies. Utilizing recent advances
  in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel
  damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems.
  First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible
  for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies),
  and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where
  we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
  method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach
  of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation
  of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within
  the HF approach of Martens.'
