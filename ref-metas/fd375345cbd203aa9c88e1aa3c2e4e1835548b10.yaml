paperAbstract: "We study the performance of \u2018integral channel features\u2019\
  \ for image classification tasks, \nfocusing in particular on pedestrian detection.\
  \ The general idea behind integral channel features is that multiple registered\
  \ image channels are computed using linear and \nnon-linear transformations of the\
  \ input image, and then features such as local sums, histograms, and Haar features\
  \ and their various generalizations are efficiently computed \nusing integral images.\
  \ Such features have been used in recent literature for a variety of \ntasks \u2013\
  \ indeed, variations appear to have been invented independently multiple times.\
  \ \nAlthough integral channel features have proven effective, little effort has\
  \ been devoted to \nanalyzing or optimizing the features themselves. In this work\
  \ we present a unified view \nof the relevant work in this area and perform a detailed\
  \ experimental evaluation. We \ndemonstrate that when designed properly, integral\
  \ channel features not only outperform \nother features including histogram of oriented\
  \ gradient (HOG), they also (1) naturally \nintegrate heterogeneous sources of information,\
  \ (2) have few parameters and are insensitive to exact parameter settings, (3) allow\
  \ for more accurate spatial localization during \ndetection, and (4) result in fast\
  \ detectors when coupled with cascade classifiers."
