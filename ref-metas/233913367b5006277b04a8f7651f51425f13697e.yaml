paperAbstract: We address the problem of estimating human pose in a single image using
  a part based approach. Pose accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the
  part detectors but more accurate detectors are likely to be also more computationally
  expensive. We propose to use multiple, heterogeneous part detectors with varying
  accuracy and computation requirements, ordered in a hierarchy, to achieve more accurate
  and efficient pose estimation. For inference, we propose an algorithm to localize
  articulated objects by exploiting an ordered hierarchy of detectors with increasing
  accuracy. The inference uses branch and bound method to search for each part and
  use kinematics from neighboring parts to guide the branching behavior and compute
  bounds on the best part estimate. We demonstrate our approach on a publicly available
  People dataset and outperform the state-of-art methods. Our inference is 3 times
  faster than one based on using a single, highly accurate detector.
