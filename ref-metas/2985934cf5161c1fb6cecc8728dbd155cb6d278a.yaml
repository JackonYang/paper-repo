paperAbstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) allows a person to access a great amount of
  data provided by a wide variety of entities. However, the content varies widely
  in expression. This makes it difficult to browse many pages effectively, even if
  the contents of the pages are quite similar. This study is the first step toward
  the reduction of such variety of WWW contents. The method proposed in this paper
  enables us to easily obtain information about similar objects scattered over the
  WWW. We focus on the tables contained in the WWW pages and propose a method to integrate
  them according to the category of objects presented in each table. The table integrated
  in a uniform format enables us to easily compare the objects of different locations
  and styles of expressions.
