paperAbstract: This article describes two complementary models that represent dependencies
  between words in local and non-local contexts. The type of local dependencies considered
  are sequences of part of speech categories for words. The non-local context of word
  dependency considered here is that of word recurrence, which is typical in a text.
  Both are models of phenomena that are to a reasonable extent domain independent,
  and thus are useful for doing prediction in systems using large vocabularies.
