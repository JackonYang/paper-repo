paperAbstract: Complex documents stored in a flat or partially marked up file format
  require layout sensitive preprocessing before any natural language processing can
  be carried out on their textual content. Contemporary technology for the discovery
  of basic textual units is based on either spatial or other content insensitive methods.
  However, there are many cases where knowledge of both the language and layout is
  required in order to establish the boundaries of the basic textual blocks. This
  paper describes a number of these cases and proposes the application of a general
  method combining knowledge about language with knowledge about the spatial arrangement
  of text. We claim that the comprehensive understanding of layout can only be achieved
  through the exploitation of layout knowledge and language knowledge in an inter-dependent
  manner.
