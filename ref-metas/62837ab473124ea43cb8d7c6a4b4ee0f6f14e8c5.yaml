paperAbstract: 'We present a method to learn and recognize object class models from
  unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes in a scale invariant manner. Objects
  are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation
  is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative
  scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale
  within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model
  are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood
  setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.
  The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range
  of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible
  objects (such as animals).'
