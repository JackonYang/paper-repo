paperAbstract: This paper describes a discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable
  part model for object detection. Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average
  precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge.
  It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty
  categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part
  models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult
  benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods
  for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining
  hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a
  hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex
  and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for
  the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make
  possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar)
  models and models involving latent three dimensional pose.
