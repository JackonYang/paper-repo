paperAbstract: The Fisher kernel is a generic framework which combines the benefits
  of generative and discriminative approaches to pattern classification. In this contribution,
  we propose to apply this framework to handwritten word-spotting. Given a word image
  and a keyword generative model, the idea is to generate a vector which describes
  how the parameters of the keyword model should be modified to best fit the word
  image.This vector can then be used as the input of a discriminative classifier.
  We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline
  on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by
  the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed
  system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear
  kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15\% relative reduction of the error but
  the detector is approximately 15 times slower.
