paperAbstract: Semantic parsing aims at mapping natural language utterances into structured
  meaning representations. In this work, we propose a structure-aware neural architecture
  which decomposes the semantic parsing process into two stages. Given an input utterance,
  we first generate a rough sketch of its meaning, where low-level information (such
  as variable names and arguments) is glossed over. Then, we fill in missing details
  by taking into account the natural language input and the sketch itself. Experimental
  results on four datasets characteristic of different domains and meaning representations
  show that our approach consistently improves performance, achieving competitive
  results despite the use of relatively simple decoders.
