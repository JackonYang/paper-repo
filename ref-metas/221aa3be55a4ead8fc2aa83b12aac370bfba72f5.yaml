paperAbstract: Although the problem of determining the minimum cost path through a
  graph arises naturally in a number of interesting applications, there has been no
  underlying theory to guide the development of efficient search procedures. Moreover,
  there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search
  strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic
  information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical
  theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of
  search strategies.
