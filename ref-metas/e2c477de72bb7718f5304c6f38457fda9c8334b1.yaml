paperAbstract: This work proposes a learning method for deep architectures that takes
  advantage of sequential data, in particular from the temporal coherence that naturally
  exists in unlabeled video recordings. That is, two successive frames are likely
  to contain the same object or objects. This coherence is used as a supervisory signal
  over the unlabeled data, and is used to improve the performance on a supervised
  task of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on some pose invariant
  object and face recognition tasks.
