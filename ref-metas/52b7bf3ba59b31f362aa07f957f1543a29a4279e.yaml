paperAbstract: 'The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group
  classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea:
  input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In
  this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties
  of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine.
  The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted
  case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this
  result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector
  networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare
  the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms
  that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.'
