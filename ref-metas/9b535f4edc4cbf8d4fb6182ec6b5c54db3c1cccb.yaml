paperAbstract: "We study visual selection: Detect and roughly localize all instances\
  \ of a generic object class, such as a face, in a greyscale scene, measuring performance\
  \ in terms of computation and false alarms. Our approach is sequential testing which\
  \ is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of\
  \ objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose\
  \ spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples,\
  \ we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201Cdecomposable,\u201D\
  \ which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays\
  \ slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements\
  \ of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the\
  \ tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the\
  \ false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating,\
  \ but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial\
  \ distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the\
  \ expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with\
  \ localized, more intensive, processing."
