paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient scene text localization method
  using gradient local correlation, which can characterize the density of pair wise
  edges and stroke width consistency to get a text confidence map. Gradient local
  correlation is insensitive to the gradient direction and robust to noise, small
  character size and shadow. Based on the text confidence map, the regions with high
  confidence are segmented into connected components (CCs), which are classified to
  text CCs and non-text CCs using an SVM classifier. Then, the text CCs with similar
  color and stroke width are grouped into text lines, which are in turn partitioned
  into words. Experimental results on the ICDAR 2003 text locating competition dataset
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
