paperAbstract: "We address the task of computing vector space representations for\
  \ the meaning of word occurrences, which can vary widely according to context. This\
  \ task is a crucial step towards a robust, vector-based compositional account of\
  \ sentence meaning. We argue that existing models for this task do not take syntactic\
  \ structure sufficiently into account. \n \nWe present a novel structured vector\
  \ space model that addresses these issues by incorporating the selectional preferences\
  \ for words' argument positions. This makes it possible to integrate syntax into\
  \ the computation of word meaning in context. In addition, the model performs at\
  \ and above the state of the art for modeling the contextual adequacy of paraphrases."
