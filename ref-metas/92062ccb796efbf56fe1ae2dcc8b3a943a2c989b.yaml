paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we compare learning techniques based on statistical
  classification to traditional methods of relevance feedback for the document routing
  problem. We consider three classification techniques which have decision rules that
  are derived via explicit error minimization: linear discriminant analysis, logistic
  regression, and neural networks. We demonstrate that the classifiers perform 1015%
  better than relevance feedback via Rocchio expansion for the TREC-2 and TREC-3 routing
  tasks. Error minimization is difficult in high-dimensional feature spaces because
  the convergence process is slow and the models are prone to overfitting. We use
  two different strategies, latent semantic indexing and optimal term selection, to
  reduce the number of features. Our results indicate that features based on latent
  semantic indexing are more effective for techniques such as linear discriminant
  analysis and logistic regression, which have no way to protect against overfitting.
  Neural networks perform equally well with either set of features and can take advantage
  of the additional information available when both feature sets are used as input.'
