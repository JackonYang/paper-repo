paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new neural architecture and an unsupervised algorithm
  for learning invariant representations from temporal sequence of images. The system
  uses two groups of complex cells whose outputs are combined multiplicatively: one
  that represents the content of the image, constrained to be constant over several
  consecutive frames, and one that represents the precise location of features, which
  is allowed to vary over time but constrained to be sparse. The architecture uses
  an encoder to extract features, and a decoder to reconstruct the input from the
  features. The method was applied to patches extracted from consecutive movie frames
  and produces orientation and frequency selective units analogous to the complex
  cells in V1. An extension of the method is proposed to train a network composed
  of units with local receptive field spread over a large image of arbitrary size.
  A layer of complex cells, subject to sparsity constraints, pool feature units over
  overlapping local neighborhoods, which causes the feature units to organize themselves
  into pinwheel patterns of orientation-selective receptive fields, similar to those
  observed in the mammalian visual cortex. A feed-forward encoder efficiently computes
  the feature representation of full images.'
