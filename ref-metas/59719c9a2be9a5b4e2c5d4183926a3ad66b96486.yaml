paperAbstract: This paper investigates the problem of recovering information about
  the configuration of an articulated object, such as a human figure, from point correspondences
  in a single-image. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed reconstruction method
  does not assume that the imagery was acquired with a calibrated camera. An analysis
  is presented which demonstrates that there are a family of solutions to this reconstruction
  problem parameterized by a single variable. A simple and effective algorithm is
  proposed for recovering the entire set of solutions by considering the foreshortening
  of the segments of the model in the image. Results obtained by applying this algorithm
  to real images are presented.
