paperAbstract: "An end-to-end real-time scene text localization and recognition method\
  \ is presented. The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection\
  \ problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions\
  \ (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation\
  \ and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability\
  \ of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with\
  \ O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are\
  \ selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more\
  \ computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with\
  \ feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most\
  \ probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained\
  \ using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the\
  \ ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results\
  \ amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end\
  \ text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method\
  \ achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against\
  \ noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201Cfalse positives\u201D\
  \ caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."
