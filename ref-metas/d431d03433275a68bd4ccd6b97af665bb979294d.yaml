paperAbstract: Overgeneration is the main source of computational complexity in previous
  principle-based parsers. This paper presents a message passing algorithm for principle-based
  parsing that avoids the overgeneration problem. This algorithm has been implemented
  in C++ and successfully tested with example sentences from (van Riemsdijk and Williams,
  1986).
