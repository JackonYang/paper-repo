paperAbstract: As a firs l~ step in many computer language processing systems, each
  word in a natural language sentence must be coded as to its form-class or part of
  speech. This paper describes a computational grammar coder which has been completely
  programmed and is oper~tional on Lhe IBM 7090. It is part of a complete syntactic
  annlysis system for which it accomplishes word-class coding, using a computational
  approach rather than the usual method of dictionary lookup. The resulting system
  is completely contained in less than 1~,000 computer words. It processes running
  English text on the IBM 7090 at a rate of more than 1250 words per minute. Since
  the system is not dependent on large dictionaries, it operates on any ordinary English
  text. In preliminary experiments with scientific text, the system correctly and
  unambiguously coded over 90 percent of the words in two samples of scientific writing.
  A fair proportion of the remaining ambiguity can be removed at higher levels of
  synvactic analysis, but the problem of structural ambiguity in natural languages
  is seen to be a critical one in the development of practical language processing
  systems.
