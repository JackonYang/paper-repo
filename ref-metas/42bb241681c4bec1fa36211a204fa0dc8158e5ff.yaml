paperAbstract: Learning a new object class from cluttered training images is very
  challenging when the location of object instances is unknown. Previous works generally
  require objects covering a large portion of the images. We present a novel approach
  that can cope with extensive clutter as well as large scale and appearance variations
  between object instances. To make this possible we propose a conditional random
  field that starts from generic knowledge and then progressively adapts to the new
  class. Our approach simultaneously localizes object instances while learning an
  appearance model specific for the class. We demonstrate this on the challenging
  PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Furthermore, our method enables to train any state-of-the-art
  object detector in a weakly supervised fashion, although it would normally require
  object location annotations.
