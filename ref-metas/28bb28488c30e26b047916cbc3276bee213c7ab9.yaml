paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \n \nNew advances in spoken language processing:\
  \ theory and practice \nIn-depth coverage of speech processing, speech recognition,\
  \ speech synthesis, spoken language understanding, and speech interface design \n\
  Many case studies from state-of-the-art systems, including examples from Microsoft's\
  \ advanced research labs \n \n \nSpoken Language Processing draws on the latest\
  \ advances and techniques from multiple fields: computer science, electrical engineering,\
  \ acoustics, linguistics, mathematics, psychology, and beyond. Starting with the\
  \ fundamentals, it presents all this and more: \n \nEssential background on speech\
  \ production and perception, probability and information theory, and pattern recognition\
  \ \nExtracting information from the speech signal: useful representations and practical\
  \ compression solutions \nModern speech recognition techniques: hidden Markov models,\
  \ acoustic and language modeling, improving resistance to environmental noises,\
  \ search algorithms, and large vocabulary speech recognition \nText-to-speech: analyzing\
  \ documents, pitch and duration controls; trainable synthesis, and more \nSpoken\
  \ language understanding: dialog management, spoken language applications, and multimodal\
  \ interfaces \n \n \nTo illustrate the book's methods, the authors present detailed\
  \ case studies based on state-of-the-art systems, including Microsoft's Whisper\
  \ speech recognizer, Whistler text-to-speech system, Dr. Who dialog system, and\
  \ the MiPad handheld device. Whether you're planning, designing, building, or purchasing\
  \ spoken language technology, this is the state of the art\x97fromalgorithms through\
  \ business productivity."
