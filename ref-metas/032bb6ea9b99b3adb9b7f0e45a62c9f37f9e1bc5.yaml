paperAbstract: Previous work has shown that independent component analysis (ICA) applied
  to feature extraction from natural image data yields features resembling Gabor functions
  and simple-cell receptive fields. This article considers the effects of including
  chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided
  into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data,
  on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various
  disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties
  of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis
  that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was
  one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides
  a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features
  could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression,
  as well as in pattern recognition.
