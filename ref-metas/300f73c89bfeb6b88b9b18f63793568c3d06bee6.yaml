paperAbstract: Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov networks, represent
  joint distributions over a set of variables by means of a graph. When the graph
  is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988)
  are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number
  of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local
  propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this
  performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we
  derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local
  propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category
  of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably
  optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be
  incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they
  receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results
  can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results
  suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for
  a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results
  for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo
  codes.
