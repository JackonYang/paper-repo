paperAbstract: We describe a highly functional prototype system for searching by visual
  features in an image database. The VisualSEEk system is novel in that the user forms
  the queries by diagramming spatial arrangements of color regions. The system nds
  the images that contain the most similar arrangements of similar regions. Prior
  to the queries, the system automatically extracts and indexes salient color regions
  from the images. By utilizing e cient indexing techniques for color information,
  region sizes and absolute and relative spatial locations, a wide variety of complex
  joint color/spatial queries may be computed.
