paperAbstract: Remarkable performance has been reported to recognize single object
  classes. Scalability to large numbers of classes however remains an important challenge
  for today's recognition methods. Several authors have promoted knowledge transfer
  between classes as a key ingredient to address this challenge. However, in previous
  work the decision which knowledge to transfer has required either manual supervision
  or at least a few training examples limiting the scalability of these approaches.
  In this work we explicitly address the question of how to automatically decide which
  information to transfer between classes without the need of any human intervention.
  For this we tap into linguistic knowledge bases to provide the semantic link between
  sources (what) and targets (where) of knowledge transfer. We provide a rigorous
  experimental evaluation of different knowledge bases and state-of-the-art techniques
  from Natural Language Processing which goes far beyond the limited use of language
  in related work. We also give insights into the applicability (why) of different
  knowledge sources and similarity measures for knowledge transfer.
