paperAbstract: A rule-based system to make inferences about document images is introduced.
  Given a digitized document image, the sys tern controls the analysis of the document,
  and identifies all the different printed regions in the document image. Logical
  "blocks" of information on the document image are interpreted and classified by
  this system which then produces as output an editable description of the entire
  document. The system uses a goal-directed top down approach, and utilizes a three-level
  rule hierarchy to implement its control strategy.
