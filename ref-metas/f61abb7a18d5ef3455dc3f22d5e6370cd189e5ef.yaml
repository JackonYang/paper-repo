paperAbstract: 'In recent years several techniques have been proposed for modelling
  the low-dimensional manifolds, or ''subspaces'', of natural images. Examples include
  principal component analysis (as used for instance in ''eigen-faces''), independent
  component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a
  number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence
  of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in
  the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel
  and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex
  non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which
  both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces
  are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate
  our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images
  and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits.'
