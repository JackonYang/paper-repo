paperAbstract: "Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in the properties\
  \ of natural images. Their statistics are important not only in image compression\
  \ but also for the study of sensory processing in biology, which can be viewed as\
  \ satisfying certain \u2018design criteria\u2019. This review summarizes previous\
  \ work on image statistics and presents our own data. Perhaps the most notable property\
  \ of natural images is an invariance to scale. We present data to support this claim\
  \ as well as evidence for a hierarchical invariance in natural scenes. These symmetries\
  \ provide a powerful description of natural images as they greatly restrict the\
  \ class of allowed distributions."
