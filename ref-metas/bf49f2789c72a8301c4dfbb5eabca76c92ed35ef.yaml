paperAbstract: We describe a method for human pose estimation in static images based
  on a novel representation of part models. Notably, we do not use articulated limb
  parts, but rather capture orientation with a mixture of templates for each part.
  We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence
  relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations.
  We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence
  and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized
  with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks
  for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for
  pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude
  faster.
