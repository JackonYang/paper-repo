paperAbstract: "2 fi COS Xi + i X 6 S i n i = \xB0i = l ' ' i = l ' Likewise it is\
  \ easily verified directly that e is p.d. for real \\ , but it is not so straightforward\
  \ to see that such functions as e~H e~*, and (1 4x)\" ? e p.d. These and other examples\
  \ are discussed in \xA7 3. Positive definite functions and their various analogues\
  \ and generalizations have arisen in diverse parts of mathematics since the beginning\
  \ of this century. They occur naturally in Fourier analysis, probability theory,\
  \ operator theory, complex function-theory, moment problems, integral equations,\
  \ boundary-value problems for partial differential equations, embedding problems,\
  \ information theory, and other areas. Their history constitutes a good illustration\
  \ of the words of Hobson [51, p. 290] : \"Not only are special results, obtained\
  \ independently of one another, frequently seen to be really included in"
