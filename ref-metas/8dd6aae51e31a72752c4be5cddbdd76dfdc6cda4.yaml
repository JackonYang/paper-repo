paperAbstract: State-of-the-art sequence labeling systems traditionally require large
  amounts of task-specific knowledge in the form of hand-crafted features and data
  pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel neutral network architecture
  that benefits from both word- and character-level representations automatically,
  by using combination of bidirectional LSTM, CNN and CRF. Our system is truly end-to-end,
  requiring no feature engineering or data pre-processing, thus making it applicable
  to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets
  for two sequence labeling tasks --- Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech
  (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER). We obtain
  state-of-the-art performance on both the two data --- 97.55\% accuracy for POS tagging
  and 91.21\% F1 for NER.
