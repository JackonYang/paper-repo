paperAbstract: We propose an approach to learning the semantics of images which allows
  us to automatically annotate an image with keywords and to retrieve images based
  on text queries. We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated
  images. We assume that every image is divided into regions, each described by a
  continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations,
  we compute a joint probabilistic model of image features and words which allow us
  to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may
  be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments
  show that our model significantly outperforms the best of the previously reported
  results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval.
