paperAbstract: 'Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models,
  a special case of which correspond to conditionally-trained finite state machines.
  A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of
  arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom, however,
  an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents
  an efficient feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle
  of iteratively constructing feature conjunctions that would significantly increase
  conditional log-likelihood if added to the model. Automated feature induction enables
  not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the
  use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables
  that may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well
  as to more arbitrary CRF structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it
  corresponds to learning clique templates, and can also be understood as supervised
  structure learning. Experimental results on named entity extraction and noun phrase
  segmentation tasks are presented.'
