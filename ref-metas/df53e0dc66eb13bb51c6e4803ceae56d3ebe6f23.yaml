paperAbstract: This paper describes the results of our work in designing a system
  for phonetic recognition of unrestricted continuous speech. We describe several
  algorithms used to recognize phonemes using context-dependent Hidden Markov Models
  of the phonemes. We present results for several variations of the parameters of
  the algorithms. In addition, we propose a technique that makes it possible to integrate
  traditional acoustic-phonetic features into a hidden Markov process. The categorical
  decisions usually associated with heuristic acoustic-phonetic algorithms are replaced
  by automated training techniques and global search strategies. The combination of
  general spectral information and specific acoustic-phonetic features is shown to
  result in more accurate phonetic recognition than either representation by itself.
