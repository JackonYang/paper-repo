paperAbstract: FrameNet is a three-year NSF-supported project in corpus-based computational
  lexicography, now in its second year (NSF IRI-9618838, "Tools for Lexicon Building").
  The project's key features are (a) a commitment to corpus evidence for semantic
  and syntactic generalizations, and (b) the representation of the valences of its
  target words (mostly nouns, adjectives, and verbs) in which the semantic portion
  makes use of frame semantics. The resulting database will contain (a) descriptions
  of the semantic frames underlying the meanings of the words described, and (b) the
  valence representation (semantic and syntactic) of several thousand words and phrases,
  each accompanied by (c) a representative collection of annotated corpus attestations,
  which jointly exemplify the observed linkings between "frame elements" and their
  syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical function, phrase type, and other syntactic
  traits). This report will present the project's goals and workflow, and information
  about the computational tools that have been adapted or created in-house for this
  work.
