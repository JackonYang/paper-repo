paperAbstract: We introduce a behavior-based similarity measure which tells us whether
  two different space-time intensity patterns of two different video segments could
  have resulted from a similar underlying motion field. This is done directly from
  the intensity information, without explicitly computing the underlying motions.
  Such a measure allows us to detect similarity between video segments of differently
  dressed people performing the same type of activity. It requires no foreground/background
  segmentation, no prior learning of activities, and no motion estimation or tracking.
  Using this behavior-based similarity measure, we extend the notion of 2-dimensional
  image correlation into the 3-dimensional space-time volume, thus allowing to correlate
  dynamic behaviors and actions. Small space-time video segments (small video clips)
  are "correlated" against entire video sequences in all three dimensions (x,y, and
  t). Peak correlation values correspond to video locations with similar dynamic behaviors.
  Our approach can detect very complex behaviors in video sequences (e.g., ballet
  movements, pool dives, running water), even when multiple complex activities occur
  simultaneously within the field-of-view of the camera.
