paperAbstract: Mean shift, a simple interactive procedure that shifts each data point
  to the average of data points in its neighborhood is generalized and analyzed in
  the paper. This generalization makes some k-means like clustering algorithms its
  special cases. It is shown that mean shift is a mode-seeking process on the surface
  constructed with a "shadow" kernal. For Gaussian kernels, mean shift is a gradient
  mapping. Convergence is studied for mean shift iterations. Cluster analysis if treated
  as a deterministic problem of finding a fixed point of mean shift that characterizes
  the data. Applications in clustering and Hough transform are demonstrated. Mean
  shift is also considered as an evolutionary strategy that performs multistart global
  optimization. >
