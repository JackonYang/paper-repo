paperAbstract: While image alignment has been studied in different areas of computer
  vision for decades, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging
  problem. Analogous to optical flow, where an image is aligned to its temporally
  adjacent frame, we propose SIFT flow, a method to align an image to its nearest
  neighbors in a large image corpus containing a variety of scenes. The SIFT flow
  algorithm consists of matching densely sampled, pixelwise SIFT features between
  two images while preserving spatial discontinuities. The SIFT features allow robust
  matching across different scene/object appearances, whereas the discontinuity-preserving
  spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene.
  Experiments show that the proposed approach robustly aligns complex scene pairs
  containing significant spatial differences. Based on SIFT flow, we propose an alignment-based
  large database framework for image analysis and synthesis, where image information
  is transferred from the nearest neighbors to a query image according to the dense
  scene correspondence. This framework is demonstrated through concrete applications
  such as motion field prediction from a single image, motion synthesis via object
  transfer, satellite image registration, and face recognition.
