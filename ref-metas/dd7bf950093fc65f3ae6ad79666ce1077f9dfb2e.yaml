paperAbstract: "We present a simple image-based method of generating novel visual\
  \ appearance in which a new image is synthesized by stitching together small patches\
  \ of existing images. We call this process image quilting. First, we use quilting\
  \ as a fast and very simple texture synthesis algorithm which produces surprisingly\
  \ good results for a wide range of textures. Second, we extend the algorithm to\
  \ perform texture transfer \u2014 rendering an object with a texture taken from\
  \ a different object. More generally, we demonstrate how an image can be re-rendered\
  \ in the style of a different image. The method works directly on the images and\
  \ does not require 3D information."
