paperAbstract: Abstract. The automatic extraction and recognition of news captions
  and annotations can be of great help locating topics of interest in digital news
  video libraries. To achieve this goal, we present a technique, called Video OCR
  (Optical Character Reader), which detects, extracts, and reads text areas in digital
  video data. In this paper, we address problems, describe the method by which Video
  OCR operates, and suggest applications for its use in digital news archives. To
  solve two problems of character recognition for videos, low-resolution characters
  and extremely complex backgrounds, we apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame
  integration and character extraction filters. Character segmentation is performed
  by a recognition-based segmentation method, and intermediate character recognition
  results are used to improve the segmentation. We also include a method for locating
  text areas using text-like properties and the use of a language-based postprocessing
  technique to increase word recognition rates. The overall recognition results are
  satisfactory for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining
  its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding
  of the news video content.
