paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a text detection method based on a feature
  vector generated from connected components produced via the stroke width transform.
  Several properties, such as variant directionality of gradient of text edges, high
  contrast with background, and geometric properties of text components jointly with
  the properties found by the stroke width transform are considered in the formation
  of feature vectors. Then, k-means clustering is performed by employing the feature
  vectors in a bid to distinguish text and non-text components. Finally, the obtained
  text components are grouped and the remaining components are discarded. Since the
  stroke width transform relies on a precise edge detection scheme, we introduce a
  novel bandlet-based edge detector which is quite effective at obtaining text edges
  in images while dismissing noisy and foliage edges. Our experimental results indicate
  a high performance for the proposed method and the effectiveness of our proposed
  edge detector for text localization purposes.
