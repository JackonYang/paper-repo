paperAbstract: "We present a method for learning a low-dimensional representation\
  \ which is shared across a set of multiple related tasks. The method builds upon\
  \ the well-known 1-norm regularization problem using a new regularizer which controls\
  \ the number of learned features common for all the tasks. We show that this problem\
  \ is equivalent to a convex optimization problem and develop an iterative algorithm\
  \ for solving it. The algorithm has a simple interpretation: it alternately performs\
  \ a supervised and an unsupervised step, where in the latter step we learn commonacross-tasks\
  \ representations and in the former step we learn task-specific functions using\
  \ these representations. We report experiments on a simulated and a real data set\
  \ which demonstrate that the proposed method dramatically improves the performance\
  \ relative to learning each task independently. Our algorithm can also be used,\
  \ as a special case, to simply select \u2013 not learn \u2013 a few common features\
  \ across the tasks."
