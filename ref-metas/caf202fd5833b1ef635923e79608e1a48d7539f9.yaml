paperAbstract: Detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large
  shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. We propose a novel approach to
  i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly
  deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them
  when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution).
  We represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected
  model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. Our model automatically
  decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to
  detect. This enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body
  part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused
  by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. We apply our method to the six
  animal categories in the PASCAL VOC dataset and show that our method significantly
  improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% AP) and provides a richer representation for
  objects. During training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.),
  making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for PASCAL VOC 2010,
  which provides a mask for each part.
