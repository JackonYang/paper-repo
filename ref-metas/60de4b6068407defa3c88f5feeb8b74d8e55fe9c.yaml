paperAbstract: We introduce a family of kernels on graphs based on the notion of regularization
  operators. This generalizes in a natural way the notion of regularization and Greens
  functions, as commonly used for real valued functions, to graphs. It turns out that
  diffusion kernels can be found as a special case of our reasoning. We show that
  the class of positive, monotonically decreasing functions on the unit interval leads
  to kernels and corresponding regularization operators.
