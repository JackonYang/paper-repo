paperAbstract: Searching for documents by their type or genre is a natural way to
  enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval. The layout of a document contains
  a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type
  in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined
  by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is
  based on 'visual similarity' of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier,
  given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of tex
  and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures,
  variations in the point size of fonts, the density of content area, and various
  statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples
  without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we
  conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with
  respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme
  using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings.
