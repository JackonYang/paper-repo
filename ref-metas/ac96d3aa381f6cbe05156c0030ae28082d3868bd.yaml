paperAbstract: In various pattern-recognition problems such as classification of photographic
  data, preprocessing operations result in a two-dimensional array of binary random
  variables. An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines
  the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions,
  with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals.
  The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence
  represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh.
  The Markov chain has a "reflecting" property in that the r th order nonstationary
  chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning
  along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically
  close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves
  are sequences of functions which have Hilbert "space-filling" curves as their limit.
  This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that
  should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions
  leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of
  spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and
  Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters
  than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not
  be restricted to binary variables.
