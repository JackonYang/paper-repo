paperAbstract: 'This article proposes a multimedia analysis framework to process video
  and text jointly for understanding events and answering user queries. The framework
  produces a parse graph that represents the compositional structures of spatial information
  (objects and scenes), temporal information (actions and events), and causal information
  (causalities between events and fluents) in the video and text. The knowledge representation
  of the framework is based on a spatial-temporal-causal AND-OR graph (S/T/C-AOG),
  which jointly models possible hierarchical compositions of objects, scenes, and
  events as well as their interactions and mutual contexts, and specifies the prior
  probabilistic distribution of the parse graphs. The authors present a probabilistic
  generative model for joint parsing that captures the relations between the input
  video/text, their corresponding parse graphs, and the joint parse graph. Based on
  the probabilistic model, the authors propose a joint parsing system consisting of
  three modules: video parsing, text parsing, and joint inference. Video parsing and
  text parsing produce two parse graphs from the input video and text, respectively.
  The joint inference module produces a joint parse graph by performing matching,
  deduction, and revision on the video and text parse graphs. The proposed framework
  has the following objectives: to provide deep semantic parsing of video and text
  that goes beyond the traditional bag-of-words approaches; to perform parsing and
  reasoning across the spatial, temporal, and causal dimensions based on the joint
  S/T/C-AOG representation; and to show that deep joint parsing facilitates subsequent
  applications such as generating narrative text descriptions and answering queries
  in the forms of who, what, when, where, and why. The authors empirically evaluated
  the system based on comparison against ground-truth as well as accuracy of query
  answering and obtained satisfactory results.'
