paperAbstract: 'Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization.
  The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem
  of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional
  data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning
  algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional
  inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its
  inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations
  do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions,
  LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those
  generated by images of faces or documents of text.'
