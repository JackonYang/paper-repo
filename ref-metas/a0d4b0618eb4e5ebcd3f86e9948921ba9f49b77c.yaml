paperAbstract: We show that efficient object recognition can be obtained by combining
  informative features with linear classification. The results demonstrate the superiority
  of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such
  as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features
  can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic
  feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant
  because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow
  linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained
  and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality,
  using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules
  (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing
  the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification
  by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning.
