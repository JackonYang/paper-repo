paperAbstract: "In multiple regression it is shown that parameter estimates based\
  \ on minimum residual sum of squares have a high probability of being unsatisfactory,\
  \ if not incorrect, if the prediction vectors are not orthogonal. Proposed is an\
  \ estimation procedure based on adding small positive quantities to the diagonal\
  \ of X\u2032X. Introduced is the ridge trace, a method for showing in two dimensions\
  \ the effects of nonorthogonality. It is then shown how to augment X\u2032X to obtain\
  \ biased estimates with smaller mean square error."
