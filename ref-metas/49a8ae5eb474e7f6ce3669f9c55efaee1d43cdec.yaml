paperAbstract: Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIs) can benefit from the
  advances in statistical parsing over the last fifteen years or so. However, statistical
  parsers require training on a massive, labeled corpus, and manually creating such
  a corpus for each database is prohibitively expensive. To address this quandary,
  this paper reports on the PRECISE NLI, which uses a statistical parser as a "plug
  in". The paper shows how a strong semantic model coupled with "light re-training"
  enables PRECISE to overcome parser errors, and correctly map from parsed questions
  to the corresponding SQL queries. We discuss the issues in using statistical parsers
  to build database-independent NLIs, and report on experimental results with the
  benchmark ATIS data set where PRECISE achieves 94% accuracy.
