paperAbstract: An object recognition system based on the dynamic link architecture,
  an extension to classical artificial neural networks (ANNs), is presented. The dynamic
  link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of
  cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These
  entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate
  the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that
  can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects
  are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution
  description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical
  distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching,
  which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function.
  The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and
  office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is
  evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery
  comprising images of 87 persons. >
