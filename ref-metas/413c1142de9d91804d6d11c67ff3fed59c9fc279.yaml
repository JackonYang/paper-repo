paperAbstract: We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate
  knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform
  more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows
  us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features.
  Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning
  which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm.
  We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function,
  which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees
  that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight.
  We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with
  common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally
  study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform
  state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
