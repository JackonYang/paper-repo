paperAbstract: Does the human brain represent objects for recognition by storing a
  series of two-dimensional snapshots, or are the object models, in some sense, three-dimensional
  analogs of the objects they represent? One way to address this question is to explore
  the ability of the human visual system to generalize recognition from familiar to
  unfamiliar views of three-dimensional objects. Three recently proposed theories
  of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional
  models [Ullman, S. (1989) Cognition 32, 193-254], linear combination of two-dimensional
  views [Ullman, S. & Basri, R. (1990) Recognition by Linear Combinations of Models
  (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge),
  A. I. Memo No. 1152], and view approximation [Poggio, T. & Edelman, S. (1990) Nature
  (London) 343, 263-266]--predict different patterns of generalization to unfamiliar
  views. We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories
  directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional
  objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as
  recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment
  or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models.
