paperAbstract: 'Many computer vision tasks rely on feature extraction. Interest points
  are such features. This paper shows that interest points are geometrically stable
  under different transformations and have high information content (distinctiveness).
  These two properties make interest points very successful in the contest of image
  matching. To measure these two properties quantitatively, we introduce two evaluation
  criteria: repeatability rate and information content. The quality of the interest
  points depends on the detector used. In this paper several detectors are compared
  according to the criteria specified above. We determine which detector gives the
  best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well.'
