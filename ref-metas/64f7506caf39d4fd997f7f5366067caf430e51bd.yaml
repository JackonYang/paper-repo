paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a segmentation-free word spotting method
  that is able to deal with heterogeneous document image collections. We propose a
  patch-based framework where patches are represented by a bag-of-visual-words model
  powered by SIFT descriptors. A later refinement of the feature vectors is performed
  by applying the latent semantic indexing technique. The proposed method performs
  well on both handwritten and typewritten historical document images. We have also
  tested our method on documents written in non-Latin scripts.
