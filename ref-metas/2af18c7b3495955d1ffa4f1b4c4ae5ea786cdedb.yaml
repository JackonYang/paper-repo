paperAbstract: In this study we investigate temporal slowness as a learning principle
  for receptive fields using slow feature analysis, a new algorithm to determine functions
  that extract slowly varying signals from the input data. We find a good qualitative
  and quantitative match between the set of learned functions trained on image sequences
  and the population of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). The functions
  show many properties found also experimentally in complex cells, such as direction
  selectivity, non-orthogonal inhibition, end-inhibition, and side-inhibition. Our
  results demonstrate that a single unsupervised learning principle can account for
  such a rich repertoire of receptive field properties.
