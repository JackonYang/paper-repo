paperAbstract: Generative probability models such as hidden Markov models provide
  a principled way of treating missing information and dealing with variable length
  sequences. On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines
  enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification
  performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier
  should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural
  way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative
  methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide
  a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial
  improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein
  sequence analysis.
