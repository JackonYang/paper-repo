paperAbstract: This paper compares the performance of several classifier algorithms
  on a standard database of handwritten digits. We consider not only raw accuracy,
  but also training time, recognition time, and memory requirements. When available,
  we report measurements of the fraction of patterns that must be rejected so that
  the remaining patterns have misclassification rates less than a given threshold.
