paperAbstract: 'Hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques are used to model families of
  biological sequences. A smooth and convergent algorithm is introduced to iteratively
  adapt the transition and emission parameters of the models from the examples in
  a given family. The HMM approach is applied to three protein families: globins,
  immunoglobulins, and kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture the important
  statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks,
  including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification. For K sequences
  of average length N, this approach yields an effective multiple-alignment algorithm
  which requires O(KN2) operations, linear in the number of sequences.'
