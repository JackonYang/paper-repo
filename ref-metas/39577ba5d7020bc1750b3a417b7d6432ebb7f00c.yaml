paperAbstract: 'Abstract : As part of the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program,
  the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) conducted supervised government tests and
  evaluations of automatic face recognition algorithms. The goal of the tests was
  to provide an independent method of evaluating algorithms and assessing the state
  of the art in automatic face recognition. This report describes the design and presents
  the results of the August 1994 and March 1995 FERET tests. Results for FERET tests
  administered by ARL between August 1994 and August 1996 are reported.'
