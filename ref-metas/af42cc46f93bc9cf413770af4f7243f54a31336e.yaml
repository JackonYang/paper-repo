paperAbstract: "Abstract. While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level\
  \ document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance\
  \ in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms,\
  \ while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally\
  \ been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper,\
  \ we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems\
  \ of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results\
  \ of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and\
  \ the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection\
  \ problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table\
  \ regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely\
  \ (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting\
  \ errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors).\
  \ This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the\
  \ results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure\
  \ recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table\
  \ DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201Cgraph probing,\u201D for comparing the\
  \ results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during\
  \ ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to\
  \ other document recognition tasks as well."
