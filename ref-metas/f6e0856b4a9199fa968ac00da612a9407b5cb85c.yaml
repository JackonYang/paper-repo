paperAbstract: We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image
  classification. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates
  a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a
  homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set.
  This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call cardinality (the size of the
  set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of
  depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under
  the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able
  to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective
  than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt,
  are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which
  we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the
  COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The
  code and models are publicly available online.
