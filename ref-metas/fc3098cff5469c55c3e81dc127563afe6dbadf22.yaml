paperAbstract: "Discriminative learning is challenging when examples are sets of features,\
  \ and the sets vary in cardinality and lack any sort of meaningful ordering. Kernel-based\
  \ classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over\
  \ unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences \u2013 generally a\
  \ computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We\
  \ present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution\
  \ histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This\
  \ \u201Cpyramid match\u201D computation is linear in the number of features, and\
  \ it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell\
  \ where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence\
  \ of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite,\
  \ making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed\
  \ only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks\
  \ and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches."
