paperAbstract: As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more
  prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in
  on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets
  remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose
  language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with
  good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most
  prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models,
  we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it
  is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its
  language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive
  biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss
  combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller,
  faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities
  for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device
  study.
