paperAbstract: "This paper describes the use of a convolutional neural network to\
  \ perform address block location on machine-printed mail pieces. Locating the address\
  \ block is a difficult object recognition problem because there is often a large\
  \ amount of extraneous printing on a mail piece and because address blocks vary\
  \ dramatically in size and shape. \n \nWe used a convolutional locator network with\
  \ four outputs, each trained to find a different corner of the address block. A\
  \ simple set of rules was used to generate ABL candidates from the network output.\
  \ The system performs very well: when allowed five guesses, the network will tightly\
  \ bound the address delivery information in 98.2% of the cases."
