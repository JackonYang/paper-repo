paperAbstract: Digital video is rapidly becoming important for education, entertainment,
  and a host of multimedia applications. With the size of the video collections growing
  to thousands of hours, technology is needed to effectively browse segments in a
  short time without losing the content of the video. We propose a method to extract
  the significant audio and video information and create a "skim" video which represents
  a very short synopsis of the original. The goal of this work is to show the utility
  of integrating language and image understanding techniques for video skimming by
  extraction of significant information, such as specific objects, audio keywords
  and relevant video structure. The resulting skim video is much shorter, where compaction
  is as high as 20:1, and yet retains the essential content of the original segment.
