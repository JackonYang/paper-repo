paperAbstract: 'Abstract: We investigate multiple techniques to improve upon the current
  state of the art deep convolutional neural network based image classification pipeline.
  The techiques include adding more image transformations to training data, adding
  more transformations to generate additional predictions at test time and using complementary
  models applied to higher resolution images. This paper summarizes our entry in the
  Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013. Our system achieved a top
  5 classification error rate of 13.55% using no external data which is over a 20%
  relative improvement on the previous year''s winner.'
