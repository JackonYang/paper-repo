paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we present a principled Bayesian method for detecting
  and segmenting instances of a particular object category within an image, providing
  a coherent methodology for combining top down and bottom up cues. The work draws
  together two powerful formulations: pictorial structures (PS) and Markov random
  fields (MRFs) both of which have efficient algorithms for their solution. The resulting
  combination, which we call the object category specific MRF, suggests a solution
  to the problem that has long dogged MRFs namely that they provide a poor prior for
  specific shapes. In contrast, our model provides a prior that is global across the
  image plane using the PS. We develop an efficient method, OBJ CUT, to obtain segmentations
  using this model. Novel aspects of this method include an efficient algorithm for
  sampling the PS model, and the observation that the expected log likelihood of the
  model can be increased by a single graph cut. Results are presented on two object
  categories, cows and horses. We compare our methods to the state of the art in object
  category specific image segmentation and demonstrate significant improvements.'
