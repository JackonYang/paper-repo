paperAbstract: There is general consensus that context can be a rich source of information
  about an object's identity, location and scale. In fact, the structure of many real-world
  scenes is governed by strong configurational rules akin to those that apply to a
  single object. Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship
  between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics
  of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains.
  The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context
  driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes.
