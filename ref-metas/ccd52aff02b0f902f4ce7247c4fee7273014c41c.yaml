paperAbstract: We present an unsupervised method for learning a hierarchy of sparse
  feature detectors that are invariant to small shifts and distortions. The resulting
  feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling
  layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a
  point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features
  is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first
  level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on
  MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples
  per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks,
  the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization
  problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance
  with very few labeled training samples.
