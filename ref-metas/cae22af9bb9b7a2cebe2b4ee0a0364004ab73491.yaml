paperAbstract: 'In this paper, I will discuss four major topics relating to current
  research in lexical semantics: methodology, descriptive coverage, adequacy of the
  representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing
  these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing
  the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues.
  Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline
  a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type
  coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic
  load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition
  is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of
  primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen
  as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a
  representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity
  in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that
  words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated
  into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance.
  This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon,
  enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.'
