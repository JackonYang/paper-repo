paperAbstract: Text localization from scene images is a challenging task that finds
  application in many areas. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid text localization
  approach that exploits Multi-resolution Maximally Stable Extremal Regions to discard
  false-positive detections from the text confidence maps generated by a Fast Feature
  Pyramid based sliding window classifier. The use of a multi-scale approach during
  both feature computation and connected component extraction allows our method to
  identify uncommon text elements that are usually not detected by competing algorithms,
  while the adoption of approximated features and appropriately filtered connected
  components assures a low overall computational complexity of the proposed system.
