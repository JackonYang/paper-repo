paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Three dimensional images, similar to depth maps, are obtained
  with a triangulation system using a television camera, and a deflectable laser beam
  diverged into a plane by a cylindrical lens. Complex objects are represented as
  structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized
  in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve
  axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are
  shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of
  complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs
  have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all
  of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls,
  have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which
  implement generalized cylinder descriptions.'
