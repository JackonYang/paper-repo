paperAbstract: In recent years significant progress has been made in the field of
  object recognition, mostly due to the introduction of powerful local image features.
  At the same time, a growing amount of images and videos are being shared on the
  Internet. This dissertation tries to combine these developments in proposing efficient
  retrieval and mining algorithms suitable for such visual data, while exploiting
  its multimodal context. The work at hand advances the state-of-the-art with three
  main contributions. Firstly, with the investigation of itemset mining algorithms
  in the domain of visual data. This class of simple, but efficient algorithms have
  proven to be a useful tool for other kinds of data. We adapt these methods to work
  with local visual features. The resulting algorithms are successfully employed to
  mine specific objects in video data, and to identify frequent feature configurations
  as representatives of object classes. The second contribution consists of a multimodal
  data-mining method, which automatically mines objects and events from community
  photo collections on the Internet. After crawling geotagged photos, the method automatically
  clusters photos showing the same object or event using visual features. The system
  then proceeds with analyzing the multimodal context of each identified cluster,
  in particular text associated with the individual photos. This analysis results
  in a textual description of the clusters. Furthermore, it is used to identify related
  Wikipedia pages. Finally, building again on the mined visual data, this assignment
  is verified, and refined up to an object-level annotation of mined entities for
  applications such as retrieval or auto-annotation. The third and final contribution
  consist of several prototype applications for scalable retrieval in visual data,
  partly building on the data mined in the previous steps. These retrieval applications
  focus on applications for
