paperAbstract: "Maji and Berg [13] have recently introduced an explicit feature map\
  \ approximating the intersection kernel. This enables efficient learning methods\
  \ for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding\
  \ the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize\
  \ this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous,\
  \ in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and\
  \ \u03C72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are\
  \ able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels\
  \ along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding\
  \ approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem;\
  \ and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations\
  \ have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard\
  \ datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show\
  \ that the \u03C72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in\
  \ most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these\
  \ train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement\
  \ over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."
