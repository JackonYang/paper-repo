paperAbstract: "A method for learning phonetic features from speech data using connectionist\
  \ networks is described. A temporal flow model is introduced in which sampled speech\
  \ data flows through a parallel network from input to output units. The network\
  \ uses hidden units with recurrent links to capture spectral/temporal characteristics\
  \ of phonetic features. A supervised learning algorithm is presented which performs\
  \ gradient descent in weight space using a coarse approximation of the desired output\
  \ as an evaluation function. \n \nA simple connectionist network with recurrent\
  \ links was trained on a single instance of the word pair \"no\" and \"go\", and\
  \ successful learned a discriminatory mechanism. The trained network also correctly\
  \ discriminated 98% of 25 other tokens of each word by the same speaker. A single\
  \ integrated spectral feature was formed without segmentation of the input, and\
  \ without a direct comparison of the two items."
