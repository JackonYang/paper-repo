paperAbstract: This paper summarizes the core idea of the T-Recs table recognition
  system, an integrated system covering block-segmentation, table location and a model-free
  structural analysis of tables. T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems
  that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g.
  Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories,
  business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location
  heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition
  precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial
  applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance
  of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive
  approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the
  ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that
  reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results
  comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given.
