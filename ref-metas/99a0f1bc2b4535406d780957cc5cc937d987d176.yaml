paperAbstract: The cross validation mean square error technique is used to determine
  the correct degree of smoothing, in fitting smoothing solines to discrete, noisy
  observations from some unknown smooth function. Monte Cario results snow amazing
  success in estimating the true smooth function as well as its derivative.
