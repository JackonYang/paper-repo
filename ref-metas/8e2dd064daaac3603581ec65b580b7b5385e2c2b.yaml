paperAbstract: A new method for detecting remote protein homologies is introduced
  and shown to perform well in classifying protein domains by SCOP superfamily. The
  method is a variant of support vector machines using a new kernel function. The
  kernel function is derived from a generative statistical model for a protein family,
  in this case a hidden Markov model. This general approach of combining generative
  models like HMMs with discriminative methods such as support vector machines may
  have applications in other areas of biosequence analysis as well.
