paperAbstract: Is an algorithm capable of high precision and recall at classifying
  lines as part of table really good at locating tables? Several document analysis
  tasks require gluing or cutting certain document elements to form others. The suitability
  of the commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is
  arguable, since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items
  at input is the same as at output. We propose new evaluation metrics especially
  suited for this type of tasks, and show their application in several table tasks.
  In the process we present robust table location and cell segmentation algorithms.
