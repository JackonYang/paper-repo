paperAbstract: Both detection and tracking people are challenging problems, especially
  in complex real world scenes that commonly involve multiple people, complicated
  occlusions, and cluttered or even moving backgrounds. People detectors have been
  shown to be able to locate pedestrians even in complex street scenes, but false
  positives have remained frequent. The identification of particular individuals has
  remained challenging as well. Tracking methods are able to find a particular individual
  in image sequences, but are severely challenged by real-world scenarios such as
  crowded street scenes. In this paper, we combine the advantages of both detection
  and tracking in a single framework. The approximate articulation of each person
  is detected in every frame based on local features that model the appearance of
  individual body parts. Prior knowledge on possible articulations and temporal coherency
  within a walking cycle are modeled using a hierarchical Gaussian process latent
  variable model (hGPLVM). We show how the combination of these results improves hypotheses
  for position and articulation of each person in several subsequent frames. We present
  experimental results that demonstrate how this allows to detect and track multiple
  people in cluttered scenes with reoccurring occlusions.
