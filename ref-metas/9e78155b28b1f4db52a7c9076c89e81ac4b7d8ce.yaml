paperAbstract: "Traditional natural language parsers are based on rewrite rule systems\
  \ developed in an arduous, time-consuming manner by grammarians. A majority of the\
  \ grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing\
  \ rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous\
  \ sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules. \nIn this\
  \ work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a\
  \ set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input,\
  \ but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development\
  \ process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of\
  \ language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign\
  \ a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence.\
  \ These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information,\
  \ potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce\
  \ highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the\
  \ disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition,\
  \ this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human\
  \ grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules. \nIn experiments between\
  \ a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based\
  \ parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material\
  \ and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based\
  \ parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving\
  \ an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%."
