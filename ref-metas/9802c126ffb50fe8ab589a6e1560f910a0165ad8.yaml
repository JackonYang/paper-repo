paperAbstract: In this paper we propose recognizing logo images by using an adaptive
  model referred to as recursive artificial neural network. At first, logo images
  are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive
  neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets.
  On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each
  exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree
  are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter,
  surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree
  representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous
  values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information
  coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are
  reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive
  neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches.
