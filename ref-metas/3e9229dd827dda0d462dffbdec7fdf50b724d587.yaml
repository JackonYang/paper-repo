paperAbstract: "Often, we need to know some integral property of the eigenvalues {x}\
  \ of a large N \xD7 N symmetric matrix A. For example, determinants det (A) = exp(\u2211\
  \ log (x)) play a role in the classic maximum entropy algorithm [Gull, 1988] . Likewise\
  \ in physics, the specific heat of a system is a temperature- -dependent sum over\
  \ the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix. However, the matrix may be so large\
  \ that direct O (N 3 calculation of all N eigenvalues is prohibited. Indeed, if\
  \ A is coded as a \u201Cfast\u201D procedure, then O (N 2 operations may also be\
  \ prohibited."
