paperAbstract: Local Coordinate Coding (LCC), introduced in (Yu et al., 2009), is
  a high dimensional nonlinear learning method that explicitly takes advantage of
  the geometric structure of the data. Its successful use in the winning system of
  last year's Pascal image classification Challenge (Everingham, 2009) shows that
  the ability to integrate geometric information is critical for some real world machine
  learning applications. This paper further develops the idea of integrating geometry
  in machine learning by extending the original LCC method to include local tangent
  directions. These new correction terms lead to better approximation of high dimensional
  nonlinear functions when the underlying data manifold is locally relatively flat.
  The method significantly reduces the number of anchor points needed in LCC, which
  not only reduces computational cost, but also improves prediction performance. Experiments
  are included to demonstrate that this method is more effective than the original
  LCC method on some image classification tasks.
