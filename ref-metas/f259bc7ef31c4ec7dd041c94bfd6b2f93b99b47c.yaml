paperAbstract: This paper aims at learning representations for long sequences of continuous
  signals. Recently, the BERT model has demonstrated the effectiveness of stacked
  transformers for representing sequences of discrete signals (i.e. word tokens).
  Inspired by its success, we adopt the stacked transformer architecture, but generalize
  its training objective to maximize the mutual information between the masked signals,
  and the bidirectional context, via contrastive loss. This enables the model to handle
  continuous signals, such as visual features. We further consider the case when there
  are multiple sequences that are semantically aligned at the sequencelevel but not
  at the element-level (e.g. video and ASR), where we propose to use a Transformer
  to estimate the mutual information between the two sequences, which is again maximized
  via contrastive loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned representations
  on modeling long video sequences for action anticipation and video captioning. The
  results show that our method, referred to by Contrastive Bidirectional Transformer
  (CBT), outperforms various baselines significantly. Furthermore, we improve over
  the state of the art.
