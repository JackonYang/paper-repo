paperAbstract: The problem of the approximation of nonlinear mapping, (especially
  continuous mappings) is considered. Regularization theory and a theoretical framework
  for approximation (based on regularization techniques) that leads to a class of
  three-layer networks called regularization networks are discussed. Regularization
  networks are mathematically related to the radial basis functions, mainly used for
  strict interpolation tasks. Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface
  reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are
  presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes
  formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized
  to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction.
  Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >
