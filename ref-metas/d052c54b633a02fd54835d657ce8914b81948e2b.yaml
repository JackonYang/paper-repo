paperAbstract: Category detection is a lively area of research. While categorization
  algorithms tend to agree in using local descriptors, they differ in the choice of
  the classifier, with some using generative models and others discriminative approaches.
  This paper presents a method for object category detection which integrates a generative
  model with a discriminative classifier. For each object category, we generate an
  appearance codebook, which becomes a common vocabulary for the generative and discriminative
  methods. Given a query image, the generative part of the algorithm finds a set of
  hypotheses and estimates their support in location and scale. Then, the discriminative
  part verifies each hypothesis on the same codebook activations. The new algorithm
  exploits the strengths of both original methods, minimizing their weaknesses. Experiments
  on several databases show that our new approach performs better than its building
  blocks taken separately. Moreover, experiments on two challenging multi-scale databases
  show that our new algorithm outperforms previously reported results
