paperAbstract: "We consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost\
  \ performance of a learning algorit,hrn when only a small set of labeled examples\
  \ is available. In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task\
  \ of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can\
  \ be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web\
  \ page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring\
  \ in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example\
  \ would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is\
  \ to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much\
  \ smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views\
  \ of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained\
  \ separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled\
  \ examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper\
  \ is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style\
  \ framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled\
  \ data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that\
  \ this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses\
  \ in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under\
