paperAbstract: We introduce and analyze a new algorithm for linear classification
  which combines Rosenblatt's perceptron algorithm with Helmbold and Warmuth's leave-one-out
  method. Like Vapnik's maximal-margin classifier, our algorithm takes advantage of
  data that are linearly separable with large margins. Compared to Vapnik's algorithm,
  however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of
  computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very
  high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using
  our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits.
  The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance
  of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on
  computation time and programming effort.
