paperAbstract: We introduce a novel representation of two-dimensional shape that we
  call smoothed local symmetries (SLS). Smoothed local symmetries represent both the
  bounding contour of a shape fragment and the region that it occupies. In this paper
  we develop the main features of the SLS repre sentation and describe an implemented
  algorithm that com putes it. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated for
  a set of tools. We conclude by sketching a method for deter mining the articulation
  of a shape into subshapes.
