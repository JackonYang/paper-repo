paperAbstract: The problem we consider in this paper is to take a single two-dimensional
  image containing a human body, locate the joint positions, and use these to estimate
  the body configuration and pose in three-dimensional space. The basic approach is
  to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different
  configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored
  views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually
  marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored
  view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic
  chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently
  similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The
  locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the
  test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then
  estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently
  - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of
  datasets.
