paperAbstract: Recognizing text in images taken in the wild is a challenging problem
  that has received great attention in recent years. Previous methods addressed this
  problem by first detecting individual characters, and then forming them into words.
  Such approaches often suffer from weak character detections, due to large intra-class
  variations, even more so than characters from scanned documents. We take a different
  view of the problem and present a holistic word recognition framework. In this,
  we first represent the scene text image and synthetic images generated from lexicon
  words using gradient-based features. We then recognize the text in the image by
  matching the scene and synthetic image features with our novel weighted Dynamic
  Time Warping (wDTW) approach. We perform experimental analysis on challenging public
  datasets, such as Street View Text and ICDAR 2003. Our proposed method significantly
  outperforms our earlier work in Mishra et al. (CVPR 2012), as well as many other
  recent works, such as Novikova et al. (ECCV 2012), Wang et al. al.(ICPR 2012), Wang
  et al.(ICCV 2011).
