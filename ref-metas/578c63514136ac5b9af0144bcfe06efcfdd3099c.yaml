paperAbstract: Table is a very common presentation scheme, but few papers touch on
  table extraction in text data mining. This paper focuses on mining tables from large-scale
  HTML texts. Table filtering, recognition, interpretation, and presentation are discussed.
  Heuristic rules and cell similarities are employed to identify tables. The F-measure
  of table recognition is 86.50%. We also propose an algorithm to capture attribute-value
  relationships among table cells. Finally, more structured data is extracted and
  presented.
