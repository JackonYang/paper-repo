paperAbstract: "This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of\
  \ processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There\
  \ are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation\
  \ called the \u201CIntegral Image\u201D which allows the features used by our detector\
  \ to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which\
  \ is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to\
  \ select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential\
  \ features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201C\
  cascade\u201D which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded\
  \ while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments\
  \ in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection\
  \ performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley\
  \ et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on\
  \ a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."
