paperAbstract: On the basis of measured receptive field profiles and spatial frequency
  tuning characteristics of simple cortical cells, it can be concluded that the representation
  of an image in the visual cortex must involve both spatial and spatial frequency
  variables. In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized
  symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields
  and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form
  of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation
  corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the
  subsequent problem of pattern recognition.
