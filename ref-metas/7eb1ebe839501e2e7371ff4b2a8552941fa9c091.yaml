paperAbstract: This paper empirically compares nine image dissimilarity measures that
  are based on distributions of color and texture features summarizing over 1,000
  CPU hours of computational experiments. Ground truth is collected via a novel random
  sampling scheme for color and via an image partitioning method for texture. Quantitative
  performance evaluations are given for classification, image retrieval, and segmentation
  tasks, and for a wide variety of dissimilarity measures. It is demonstrated how
  the selection of a measure, based on large scale evaluation, substantially improves
  the quality of classification, retrieval, and unsupervised segmentation of color
  and texture images.
