paperAbstract: 'Abstract : This report describes a knowledge-base system in which
  the information is stored in a network of small parallel processing elements--node
  and link units--which are controlled by an external serial computer. Discussed is
  NETL, a language for storing real-world information in such a network. A simulator
  for the parallel network system has been implemented in MACLISP, and an experimental
  version of NETL is running on this simulator. A number of test-case results and
  simulated timings will be presented. (Author)'
