paperAbstract: To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited
  number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the unlabeled
  examples. The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure
  in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation
  criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way
  classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution.
  The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set
  through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend
  this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate
  the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems.
