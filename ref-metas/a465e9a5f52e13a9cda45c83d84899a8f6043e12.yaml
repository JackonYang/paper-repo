paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of computing cues to the three-dimensional
  structure of surfaces in the world directly from the local structure of the brightness
  pattern of a binocular image pair. The geometric information content of the gradient
  of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with
  symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry.
  A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed.
  This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly
  from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without
  iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental
  results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images.
