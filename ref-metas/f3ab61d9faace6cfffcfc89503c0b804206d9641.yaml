paperAbstract: 'A recent paper posed the question: "Graph Matching: What are we really
  talking about?". Far from providing a definite answer to that question, in this
  paper we will try to characterize the role that graphs play within the Pattern Recognition
  field. To this aim two taxonomies are presented and discussed. The first includes
  almost all the graph matching algorithms proposed from the late seventies, and describes
  the different classes of algorithms. The second taxonomy considers the types of
  common applications of graph-based techniques in the Pattern Recognition and Machine
  Vision field.'
