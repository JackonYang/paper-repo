paperAbstract: "In today\u2019s world, form processing systems must be able to recognize\
  \ mutant forms that appear to be based on differing templates but are actually only\
  \ a variation of the original. A single definition of a representative template\
  \ actually covers large varieties of the same logical templates. We developed a\
  \ method and system, similar to the human visual system, which differentiates between\
  \ templates via features such as logos, dominant words, and geometrical shapes,\
  \ while ignoring minor details and variations. When the system finds an appropriate\
  \ template, it then decodes the content of the form. Our approach has been applied\
  \ in several scenarios with encouraging results."
