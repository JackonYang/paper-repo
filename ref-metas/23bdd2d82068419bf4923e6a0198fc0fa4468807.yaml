paperAbstract: We propose an architecture for fine-grained visual categorization that
  approaches expert human performance in the classification of bird species. Our architecture
  first computes an estimate of the object's pose; this is used to compute local image
  features which are, in turn, used for classification. The features are computed
  by applying deep convolutional nets to image patches that are located and normalized
  by the pose. We perform an empirical study of a number of pose normalization schemes,
  including an investigation of higher order geometric warping functions. We propose
  a novel graph-based clustering algorithm for learning a compact pose normalization
  space. We perform a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep convolutional
  feature implementations and fine-tuning feature learning for fine-grained classification.
  We observe that a model that integrates lower-level feature layers with pose-normalized
  extraction routines and higher-level feature layers with unaligned image features
  works best. Our experiments advance state-of-the-art performance on bird species
  recognition, with a large improvement of correct classification rates over previous
  methods (75% vs. 55-65%).
