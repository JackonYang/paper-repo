paperAbstract: It is demonstrated that the affine viewing transformation is a reasonable
  approximation to perspective. A group of image vertices and edges, called the vertex-pair,
  which fully determines the affine transformation between a three-dimensional model
  and a two-dimensional image is defined. A clustering approach, which produces a
  set of consistent assignments between vertex-pairs in the model and in the image
  is described. A number of experimental results on outdoor images are presented.
