paperAbstract: 'We propose a novel global pose estimation method to detect body parts
  of articulated objects in images based on non-tree graph models. There are two kinds
  of edges defined in the body part relation graph: Strong (tree) edges corresponding
  to the body plan that can enforce any type of constraint, and weak (non-tree) edges
  that express exclusion constraints arising from inter-part occlusion and symmetry
  conditions. We express optimal part localization as a multiple shortest path problem
  in a set of correlated trellises constructed from the graph model. Strong model
  edges generate the trellises, while weak model edges prohibit implausible poses
  by generating exclusion constraints among trellis nodes and edges. The optimization
  may be expressed as an integer linear program and solved using a novel two-stage
  relaxation scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method has a high chance of
  obtaining the globally optimal pose at low computational cost.'
