paperAbstract: A series of information retrieval experiments was carried out with
  a computer installed in a medical practice setting for relatively inexperienced
  physician end-users. Using a commercial MEDLINE product based on the vector space
  model, these physicians searched just as effectively as more experienced searchers
  using Boolean searching. The results of this experiment were subsequently used to
  create a new large medical test collection, which was used in experiments with the
  SMART retrieval system to obtain baseline performance data as well as compare SMART
  with the other searchers.
