paperAbstract: "Recent research has demonstrated the strong performance of hidden\
  \ Markov models applied to information extraction\u2014the task of populating database\
  \ slots with corresponding phrases from text documents. A remaining problem, however,\
  \ is the selection of state-transition structure for the model. This paper demonstrates\
  \ that extraction accuracy strongly depends on the selection of structure, and presents\
  \ an algorithm for automatically finding good structures by stochastic optimization.\
  \ Our algorithm begins with a simple model and then performs hill-climbing in the\
  \ space of possible structures by splitting states and gauging performance on a\
  \ validation set. Experimental results show that this technique finds HMM models\
  \ that almost always out-perform a fixed model, and have superior average performance\
  \ across tasks."
