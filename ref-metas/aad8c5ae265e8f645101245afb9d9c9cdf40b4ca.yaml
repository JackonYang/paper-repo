paperAbstract: By a "tree-bank grammar" we mean a context-free grammar created by
  reading the production rules directly from hand-parsed sentences in a tree bank.
  Common wisdom has it that such grammars do not perform we & though we know of no
  published data on the issue. The primary purpose of this paper is to show that the
  common wisdom is wrong. In particular, we present results on a tree-bank grammar
  based on the Penn WaII Street Journal tree bank. To the best of our knowledge, this
  grammar outperforms ah other non-word-based statistical parsers/grammars on this
  corpus. That is, it outperforms parsers that consider the input as a string of tags
  and ignore the actual words of the corpus.
