paperAbstract: 'Experiments on the use of a probabilistic model to tag English text,
  that is, to assign to each word the correct tag (part of speech) in the context
  of the sentence, are presented. A simple triclass Markov model is used, and the
  best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount
  of training data that is provided, is found. Two approaches are compared: the use
  of text that has been tagged by hand and comparing relative frequency counts; and
  use text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according
  to a maximum likelihood principle. Experiments show that the best training is obtained
  by using as much tagged text as is available, a maximum likelihood training may
  improve the accuracy of the tagging.<<ETX>>'
