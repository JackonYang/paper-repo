paperAbstract: Table form document structure analysis is an important problem in the
  document processing domain. The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning
  (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching
  characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach.
  Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in
  characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions
  directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that
  BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters
  and broken lines.
