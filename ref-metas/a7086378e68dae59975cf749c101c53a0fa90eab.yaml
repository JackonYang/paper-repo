paperAbstract: Straightforward classification using kernelized SVMs requires evaluating
  the kernel for a test vector and each of the support vectors. For a class of kernels
  we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one
  can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of
  the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear
  for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables
  we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements,
  independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification
  accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other
  kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level
  histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection
  datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based
  on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at
  10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On
  the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best
  results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments
  our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and
  requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible
  using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset
  with negligible loss of accuracy.
