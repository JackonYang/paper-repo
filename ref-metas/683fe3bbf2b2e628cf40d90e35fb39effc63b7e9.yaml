paperAbstract: A method is presented to approximate optimally an n -dimensional discrete
  probability distribution by a product of second-order distributions, or the distribution
  of the first-order tree dependence. The problem is to find an optimum set of n -
  1 first order dependence relationship among the n variables. It is shown that the
  procedure derived in this paper yields an approximation of a minimum difference
  in information. It is further shown that when this procedure is applied to empirical
  observations from an unknown distribution of tree dependence, the procedure is the
  maximum-likelihood estimate of the distribution.
