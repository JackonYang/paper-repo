paperAbstract: The problem of recognizing classes of objects as opposed to special
  instances requires methods of comparing images that capture the variation within
  the class while they discriminate against objects outside the class. We present
  a simple method for image description based on histograms of qualitative shape indexes
  computed from the combination of triplets of sampled locations and gradient directions
  in the image. We demonstrate that this method indeed is able to capture variation
  within classes of objects and we apply it to the problem of recognizing four different
  categories from a large database. Using our descriptor on the whole image, containing
  varying degrees of background clutter, we obtain results for two of the objects
  that are superior to the best results published so far for this database. By cropping
  images manually we demonstrate that our method has a potential to handle also the
  other objects when supplied with an algorithm for searching the image. We argue
  that our method, based on qualitative image properties, capture the large range
  of variation that is typically encountered within an object class. This means that
  our method can be used on substantially larger patches of images than existing methods
  based on simpler criteria for evaluating image similarity.
