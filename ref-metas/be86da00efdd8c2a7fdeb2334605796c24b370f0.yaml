paperAbstract: We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large
  variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification
  approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional
  space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face,
  under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high
  dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However,
  since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing,
  images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this
  deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts
  those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on
  Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional
  subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface
  technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low
  dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental
  results demonstrate that the proposed "Fisherface" method has error rates that are
  lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face
  databases.
