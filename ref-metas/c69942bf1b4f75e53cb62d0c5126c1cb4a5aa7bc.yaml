paperAbstract: OCR is inevitably linked to NLP since its final output is in text.
  Advances in document intelligence are driving the need for a unified technology
  that integrates OCR with various NLP tasks, especially semantic parsing. Since OCR
  and semantic parsing have been studied as separate tasks so far, the datasets for
  each task on their own are rich, while those for the integrated post-OCR parsing
  tasks are relatively insufficient. In this study, we publish a consolidated dataset
  for receipt parsing as the first step towards post-OCR parsing tasks. The dataset
  consists of thousands of Indonesian receipts, which contains images and box/text
  annotations for OCR, and multi-level semantic labels for parsing. The proposed dataset
  can be used to address various OCR and parsing tasks.
