paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel framework to extract text regions
  from scene images with complex backgrounds and multiple text appearances. This framework
  consists of three main steps: boundary clustering (BC), stroke segmentation, and
  string fragment classification. In BC, we propose a new bigram-color-uniformity-based
  method to model both text and attachment surface, and cluster edge pixels based
  on color pairs and spatial positions into boundary layers. Then, stroke segmentation
  is performed at each boundary layer by color assignment to extract character candidates.
  We propose two algorithms to combine the structural analysis of text stroke with
  color assignment and filter out background interferences. Further, we design a robust
  string fragment classification based on Gabor-based text features. The features
  are obtained from feature maps of gradient, stroke distribution, and stroke width.
  The proposed framework of text localization is evaluated on scene images, born-digital
  images, broadcast video images, and images of handheld objects captured by blind
  persons. Experimental results on respective datasets demonstrate that the framework
  outperforms state-of-the-art localization algorithms.'
