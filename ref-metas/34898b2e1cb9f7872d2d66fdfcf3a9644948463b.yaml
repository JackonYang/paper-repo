paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Cells were recorded with tungsten electrodes in the dorsal
  lateral geniculate body of the cat. Receptive fields of these units were mapped
  out, in the light-adapted state, with small sports of light. In their general arrangement
  geniculate receptive fields resembled those of retinal ganglion cells, having an
  excitatory (''on'') centre and inhibitory (''off'') preriphery, or reverse. The
  two portions of a receptive field were mutually antagonistic; the decrease in centre
  responses cauded by inclusion of peripheral portions of receptive fields was termed
  peripheral suppression. Cells recorded in layers A and B of the lateral geniculate
  body were driven from the contralateral eye; cells in layer A1 from the ipsilateral
  eye. In penetrations normal to the layers receptive fields of cells in a single
  layer were close together or superimposed, and from one layer to the next occupied
  exactly homologous positions in the two retinas. Binocular interaction was not observed
  in any of the cells studied. All three layers of the lateral geniculate contained
  both ''on''-centre and ''off''-centre units. Cells in layers A and A1 were similar
  both in their firing patterns and in average receptive field size. Cells in layer
  B were more sluggish in their responses to light stimuli, and tended to have larger
  receptive field centres. Cells with receptive fields within or near the area centralis
  tended to have smaller field centres and stronger suppression by the receptive field
  periphery than cells with their fields situated in more peripheral regions of the
  retina.'
