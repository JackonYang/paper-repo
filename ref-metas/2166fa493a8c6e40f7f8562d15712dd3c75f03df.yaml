paperAbstract: 'An approach to automatic translation is outlined that utilizes techniques
  of statistical information extraction from large data bases. The method is based
  on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are translations
  of each other. In our case, the texts are in English and French.Fundamental to the
  technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions. The steps
  of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set
  of fixed locutions. (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the
  corresponding set of fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence.
  (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence forming the
  target sentence.We have developed statistical techniques facilitating both the automatic
  creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps, all
  on the basis of an alignment of corresponding sentences in the two texts.While we
  are not yet able to provide examples of French / English translation, we present
  some encouraging intermediate results concerning glossary creation and the arrangement
  of target word sequences.'
