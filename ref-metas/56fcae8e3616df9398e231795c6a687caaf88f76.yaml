paperAbstract: We investigate several conceptions of linguistic structure to determine
  whether or not they can provide simple and "revealing" grammars that generate all
  of the sentences of English and only these. We find that no finite-state Markov
  process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an
  English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce
  n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing
  n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase
  structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is
  essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type
  of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small
  subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical
  transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with
  derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of
  the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English
  is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel
  of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations;
  and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use
  and understanding of language.
