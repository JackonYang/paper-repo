paperAbstract: "Current work in object categorization discriminates among objects\
  \ that typically possess gross differences which are readily apparent. However,\
  \ many applications require making much finer distinctions. We address an insect\
  \ categorization problem that is so challenging that even trained human experts\
  \ cannot readily categorize images of insects considered in this paper. The state\
  \ of the art that uses visual dictionaries, when applied to this problem, yields\
  \ mediocre results (16.1% error). Three possible explanations for this are (a) the\
  \ dictionaries are unsupervised, (b) the dictionaries lose the detailed information\
  \ contained in each keypoint, and (c) these methods rely on hand-engineered decisions\
  \ about dictionary size. This paper presents a novel, dictionary-free methodology.\
  \ A random forest of trees is first trained to predict the class of an image based\
  \ on individual keypoint descriptors. A unique aspect of these trees is that they\
  \ do not make decisions but instead merely record evidence-i.e., the number of descriptors\
  \ from training examples of each category that reached each leaf of the tree. We\
  \ provide a mathematical model showing that voting evidence is better than voting\
  \ decisions. To categorize a new image, descriptors for all detected keypoints are\
  \ \u201Cdropped\u201D through the trees, and the evidence at each leaf is summed\
  \ to obtain an overall evidence vector. This is then sent to a second-level classifier\
  \ to make the categorization decision. We achieve excellent performance (6.4% error)\
  \ on the 9-class STONEFLY9 data set. Also, our method achieves an average AUC of\
  \ 0.921 on the PASCAL06 VOC, which places it fifth out of 21 methods reported in\
  \ the literature and demonstrates that the method also works well for generic object\
  \ categorization."
