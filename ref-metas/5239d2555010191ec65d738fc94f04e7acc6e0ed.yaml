paperAbstract: 'Retrieving images from very large collections, using image content
  as a key, is becoming an important problem. Users prefer to ask for pictures using
  notions of content that are strongly oriented to the presence of abstractly defined
  objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable,
  but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer
  vision cannot recognize very general objects in very general contexts. This paper
  describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence
  of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of
  image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints
  that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite general contexts.
  This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual
  primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies
  in the classification process; the ability to deal with rather general objects in
  uncontrolled configurations and contexts. We illustrate these properties with four
  case-studies: one demonstrating the use of color and texture descriptors; one showing
  how trees can be described by fusing texture and geometric properties; one learning
  scenery concepts using grouped features; and one showing how this view of recognition
  yields a program that can tell, quite accurately, whether a picture contains naked
  people or not.'
