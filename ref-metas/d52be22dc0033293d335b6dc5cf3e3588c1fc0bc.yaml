paperAbstract: The human visual system analyzes shapes and objects in a series of
  stages in which stimulus features of increasing complexity are extracted and analyzed.
  The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented
  in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate
  complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations
  remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex.
  Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic
  visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative
  for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally
  by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class
  of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing
  and a principle for their extraction.
