paperAbstract: 'We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually
  infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate
  prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds
  to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are
  in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating
  power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes
  of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure
  and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will
  answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability,
  since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier
  based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine
  a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative
  features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect,
  each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen
  depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries,
  standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not
  feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node,
  constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees.
  The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution
  over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating
  the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits
  and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art
  error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database
  of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance,
  generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural
  networks methods is presented in this context. Figure 1: LATEX Symbol'
