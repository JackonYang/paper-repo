paperAbstract: 'Important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision,
  error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated
  as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs. The belief propagation
  (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the
  factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We
  show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation
  of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free
  energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized
  belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation
  must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. We describe
  the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid
  approximations: the "Bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation
  method", and the "region graph method". Finally, we explain how to tell whether
  a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to
  be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform
  BP.'
