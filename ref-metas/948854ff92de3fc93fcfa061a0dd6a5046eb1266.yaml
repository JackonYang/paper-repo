paperAbstract: It is very difficult to analyze form structures because of breaks in
  lines and additional noises in the form image. This paper focuses on cell recognition
  in low quality form images. The recognition method has two features to achieve robustness
  in cell recognition. One is grid representation using several types of intersection
  and the terminal points of the frame lines. The other is the recursive modification
  of the representation. A new representation is created according to the determination
  of the breaks in the line and the hypothesized location of the missed intersections
  by using the previous representation. The modification is processed recursively
  until the representation has perfect consistency and all form cells are detected.
  In an experiment using 1565 form samples, all cells in 1538 samples (98.3% of 1565
  samples) were recognized correctly by this method.
