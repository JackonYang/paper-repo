paperAbstract: One of the central problems in machine learning and pattern recognition
  is to develop appropriate representations for complex data. We consider the problem
  of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded
  in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian,
  the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation,
  we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional
  data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality
  reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering.
  Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed.
