paperAbstract: "We present two novel methods for face verification. Our first method\
  \ - \u201Cattribute\u201D classifiers - uses binary classifiers trained to recognize\
  \ the presence or absence of describable aspects of visual appearance (e.g., gender,\
  \ race, and age). Our second method - \u201Csimile\u201D classifiers - removes the\
  \ manual labeling required for attribute classification and instead learns the similarity\
  \ of faces, or regions of faces, to specific reference people. Neither method requires\
  \ costly, often brittle, alignment between image pairs; yet, both methods produce\
  \ compact visual descriptions, and work on real-world images. Furthermore, both\
  \ the attribute and simile classifiers improve on the current state-of-the-art for\
  \ the LFW data set, reducing the error rates compared to the current best by 23.92%\
  \ and 26.34%, respectively, and 31.68% when combined. For further testing across\
  \ pose, illumination, and expression, we introduce a new data set - termed PubFig\
  \ - of real-world images of public figures (celebrities and politicians) acquired\
  \ from the internet. This data set is both larger (60,000 images) and deeper (300\
  \ images per individual) than existing data sets of its kind. Finally, we present\
  \ an evaluation of human performance."
