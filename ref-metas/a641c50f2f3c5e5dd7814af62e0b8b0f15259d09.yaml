paperAbstract: This paper presents a systematic analysis of the role of opponent type
  processing in colour vision and the relation between opponent type colour transformations
  and the initial three colour mechanisms. It is shown that efficient information
  transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms
  into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation
  is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical
  rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after
  the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz
  approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral
  response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point
  of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic
  readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour
  information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations
  to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed.
  Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that
  a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three
  significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system.
