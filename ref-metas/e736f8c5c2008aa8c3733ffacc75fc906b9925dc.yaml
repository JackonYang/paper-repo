paperAbstract: We suggest from the psychophysical data on two-point and line acuity
  that the smallest foveal channel in human vision must have an excitatory center
  with a diameter of around 1' 20". Taking into account the optics of the eye and
  the finite size of the receptors, we show that this would correspond well to the
  properties of a retinal ganglion cell receiving excitatory input from a single cone.
