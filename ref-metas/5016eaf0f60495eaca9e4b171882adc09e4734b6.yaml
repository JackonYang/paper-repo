paperAbstract: 'Spatial pyramid matching (SPM) based pooling has been the dominant
  choice for state-of-art image classification systems. In contrast, we propose a
  novel object-centric spatial pooling (OCP) approach, following the intuition that
  knowing the location of the object of interest can be useful for image classification.
  OCP consists of two steps: (1) inferring the location of the objects, and (2) using
  the location information to pool foreground and background features separately to
  form the image-level representation. Step (1) is particularly challenging in a typical
  classification setting where precise object location annotations are not available
  during training. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that learns object
  detectors using only image-level class labels, or so-called weak labels. We validate
  our approach on the challenging PASCAL07 dataset. Our learned detectors are comparable
  in accuracy with state-of-the-art weakly supervised detection methods. More importantly,
  the resulting OCP approach significantly outperforms SPM-based pooling in image
  classification.'
