paperAbstract: The distance transform (DT) is a general operator forming the basis
  of many methods in computer vision and geometry, with great potential for practical
  applications. However, all the optimal algorithms for the computation of the exact
  Euclidean DT (EDT) were proposed only since the 1990s. In this work, state-of-the-art
  sequential 2D EDT algorithms are reviewed and compared, in an effort to reach more
  solid conclusions regarding their differences in speed and their exactness. Six
  of the best algorithms were fully implemented and compared in practice.
