paperAbstract: The theory behind the success of adaptive reweighting and combining
  algorithms (arcing) such as Adaboost (Freund & Schapire, 1996a, 1997) and others
  in reducing generalization error has not been well understood. By formulating prediction
  as a game where one player makes a selection from instances in the training set
  and the other a convex linear combination of predictors from a finite set, existing
  arcing algorithms are shown to be algorithms for finding good game strategies. The
  minimax theorem is an essential ingredient of the convergence proofs. An arcing
  algorithm is described that converges to the optimal strategy. A bound on the generalization
  error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error is proven that
  is sharper than bounds to date. Schapire, Freund, Bartlett, and Lee (1997) offered
  an explanation of why Adaboost works in terms of its ability to produce generally
  high margins. The empirical comparison of Adaboost to the optimal arcing algorithm
  shows that their explanation is not complete.
