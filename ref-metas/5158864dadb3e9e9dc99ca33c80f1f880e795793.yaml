paperAbstract: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are an effective tool for a variety
  of different data segmentation and labeling tasks including visual scene interpretation,
  which seeks to partition images into their constituent semantic-level regions and
  assign appropriate class labels to each region. For accurate labeling it is important
  to capture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce
  a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features
  aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF
  learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to
  produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled
  nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the
  known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used
  to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations
  and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control
  the step size. Our experimental results show that effective models can be learned
  from fragmentary labelings and that incorporating top-down aggregate features significantly
  improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art
  on three different image datasets.
