paperAbstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of locating and extracting text
  from WWW images. A previous algorithm based on color clustering and connected components
  analysis works well as long as the color of each character is relatively uniform
  and the typography is fairly simple. It breaks down quickly, however, when these
  assumptions are violated. In this paper, we describe more robust techniques for
  dealing with this challenging problem. We present an improved color clustering algorithm
  that measures similarity based on both RGB and spatial proximity. Layout analysis
  is also incorporated to handle more complex typography. THese changes significantly
  enhance the performance of our text detection procedure.
