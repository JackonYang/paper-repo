paperAbstract: "In very fast recognition tasks, scenes are identified as fast as isolated\
  \ objects How can this efficiency be achieved, considering the large number of component\
  \ objects and interfering factors, such as cast shadows and occlusions? Scene categories\
  \ tend to have distinct and typical spatial organizations of their major components\
  \ If human perceptual structures were tuned to extract this information early in\
  \ processing, a coarse-to-fine process could account for efficient scene recognition\
  \ A coarse description of the input scene (oriented \u201Cblobs\u201D in a particular\
  \ spatial organization) would initiate recognition before the identity of the objects\
  \ is processed We report two experiments that contrast the respective roles of coarse\
  \ and fine information in fast identification of natural scenes The first experiment\
  \ investigated whether coarse and fine information were used at different stages\
  \ of processing The second experiment tested whether coarse-to-fine processing accounts\
  \ for fast scene categorization The data suggest that recognition occurs at both\
  \ coarse and fine spatial scales By attending first to the coarse scale, the visual\
  \ system can get a quick and rough estimate of the input to activate scene schemas\
  \ in memory, attending to fine information allows refinement, or refutation, of\
  \ the raw estimate"
