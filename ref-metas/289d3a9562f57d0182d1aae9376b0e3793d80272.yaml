paperAbstract: Publisher Summary This chapter discusses data concerning the time course
  of word identification in a discourse context. A simulation of arithmetic word-problem
  understanding provides a plausible account for some well-known phenomena. The current
  theories use representations with several mutually constraining layers. There is
  typically a linguistic level of representation, conceptual levels to represent both
  the local and global meaning and structure of a text, and a level at which the text
  itself has lost its individuality and its information content. Knowledge provides
  part of the context within which a discourse interpreted. The integration phase
  is the price the model pays for the necessary flexibility in the construction process.
