paperAbstract: Semantic hashing[1] seeks compact binary codes of data-points so that
  the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with semantic similarity. In this
  paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely
  related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By
  relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply
  a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent
  results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions
  of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data-point.
  Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely
  simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art.
