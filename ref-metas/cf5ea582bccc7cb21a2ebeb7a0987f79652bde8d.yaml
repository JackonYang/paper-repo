paperAbstract: Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge
  bases, including Wikipedia, Freebase, YAGO, Microsoft's Satori, and Google's Knowledge
  Graph. To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods
  for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on
  text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault,
  a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content
  (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations)
  with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised
  machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge
  Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge
  repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated
  probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that
  explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction
  methods.
