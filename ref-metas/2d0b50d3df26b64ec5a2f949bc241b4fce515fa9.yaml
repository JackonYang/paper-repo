paperAbstract: 'We present a method for recovering 3D human body motion from monocular
  video sequences using robust image matching, joint limits and non-self-intersection
  constraints, and a new sample-and-refine search strategy guided by rescaled cost-function
  covariances. Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: for reliable tracking at
  least 30 joint parameters need to be estimated, subject to highly nonlinear physical
  constraints; the problem is chronically ill conditioned as about 1/3 of the d.o.f.
  (the depth-related ones) are almost unobservable in any given monocular image; and
  matching an imperfect, highly flexible self-occluding model to cluttered image features
  is intrinsically hard. To reduce correspondence ambiguities we use a carefully designed
  robust matching-cost metric that combines robust optical flow, edge energy, and
  motion boundaries. Even so, the ambiguity, nonlinearity and non-observability make
  the parameter-space cost surface multi-modal, unpredictable and ill conditioned,
  so minimizing it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers,
  and introduce a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled
  sampling and continuous optimization subject to physical constraints. Experiments
  on some challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modelling, joint and
  self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable
  monocular 3D body tracking.'
