paperAbstract: In stochastic language modeling, backing-off is a widely used method
  to cope with the sparse data problem. In case of unseen events this method backs
  off to a less specific distribution. In this paper we propose to use distributions
  which are especially optimized for the task of backing-off. Two different theoretical
  derivations lead to distributions which are quite different from the probability
  distributions that are usually used for backing-off. Experiments show an improvement
  of about 10% in terms of perplexity and 5% in terms of word error rate.
