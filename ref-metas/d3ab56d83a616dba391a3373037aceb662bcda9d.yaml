paperAbstract: "One of the main challenges in learning fine-grained visual categories\
  \ is gathering training images. Recent work in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) circumvents\
  \ this challenge by describing categories via attributes or text. However, not all\
  \ visual concepts, e.g., two people dancing, are easily amenable to such descriptions.\
  \ In this paper, we propose a new modality for ZSL using visual abstraction to learn\
  \ difficult-to-describe concepts. Specifically, we explore concepts related to people\
  \ and their interactions with others. Our proposed modality allows one to provide\
  \ training data by manipulating abstract visualizations, e.g., one can illustrate\
  \ interactions between two clipart people by manipulating each person\u2019s pose,\
  \ expression, gaze, and gender. The feasibility of our approach is shown on a human\
  \ pose dataset and a new dataset containing complex interactions between two people,\
  \ where we outperform several baselines. To better match across the two domains,\
  \ we learn an explicit mapping between the abstract and real worlds."
