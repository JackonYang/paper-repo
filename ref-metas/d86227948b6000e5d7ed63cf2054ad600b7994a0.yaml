paperAbstract: Many existing deep learning models for natural language processing
  tasks focus on learning the compositionality of their inputs, which requires many
  expensive computations. We present a simple deep neural network that competes with
  and, in some cases, outperforms such models on sentiment analysis and factoid question
  answering tasks while taking only a fraction of the training time. While our model
  is syntactically-ignorant, we show significant improvements over previous bag-of-words
  models by deepening our network and applying a novel variant of dropout. Moreover,
  our model performs better than syntactic models on datasets with high syntactic
  variance. We show that our model makes similar errors to syntactically-aware models,
  indicating that for the tasks we consider, nonlinearly transforming the input is
  more important than tailoring a network to incorporate word order and syntax.
