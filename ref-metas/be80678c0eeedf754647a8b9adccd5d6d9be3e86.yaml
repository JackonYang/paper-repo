paperAbstract: "This paper presents a method of page segmentation based on the approximated\
  \ area Voronoi diagram. The characteristics of the proposed method are as follows:\
  \ (1) The Voronoi diagram enables us to obtain the candidates of boundaries of document\
  \ components from page images with non-Manhattan layout and a skew. (2) The candidates\
  \ are utilized to estimate the intercharacter and interline gaps without the use\
  \ of domain-specific parameters to select the boundaries. From the experimental\
  \ results for 128 images with non-Manhattan layout and the skew of 0\xB0~45\xB0\
  \ as well as 98 images with Manhattan layout, we have confirmed that the method\
  \ is effective for extraction of body text regions, and it is as efficient as other\
  \ methods based on connected component analysis."
