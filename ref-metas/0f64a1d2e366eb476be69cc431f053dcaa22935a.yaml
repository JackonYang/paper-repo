paperAbstract: Text detection is fundamental to video information retrieval and indexing.
  Existing methods cannot handle well those texts with different contrast or embedded
  in a complex background. To handle these difficulties, this paper proposes an efficient
  text detection approach, which is based on invariant features, such as edge strength,
  edge density, and horizontal distribution. First, it applies edge detection and
  uses a low threshold to filter out definitely non-text edges. Then, a local threshold
  is selected to both keep low-contrast text and simplify complex background of high-contrast
  text. Next, two text-area enhancement operators are proposed to highlight those
  areas with either high edge strength or high edge density. Finally, coarse-to-fine
  detection locates text regions efficiently. Experimental results show that this
  approach is robust for contrast, font-size, font-color, language, and background
  complexity.
