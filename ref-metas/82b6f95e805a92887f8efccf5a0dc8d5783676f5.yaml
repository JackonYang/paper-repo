paperAbstract: Abstract.The increasing availability of high-performance, low-priced,
  portable digital imaging devices has created a tremendous opportunity for supplementing
  traditional scanning for document image acquisition. Digital cameras attached to
  cellular phones, PDAs, or wearable computers, and standalone image or video devices
  are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of thick books, historical
  manuscripts too fragile to touch, and text in scenes, making them much more versatile
  than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured
  with such devices become available, there will clearly be a demand in many domains.
  Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference
  and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images.
  Camera-captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion,
  as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this
  paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges, and solutions
  for the analysis of documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing
  typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from
  a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample
  applications under development and feasible ideas for future development.
