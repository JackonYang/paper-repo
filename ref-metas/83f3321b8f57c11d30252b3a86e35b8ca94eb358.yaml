paperAbstract: The projection of depth or orientation discontinuities in a physical
  scene results in image intensity edges which are not ideal step edges but are more
  typically a combination of step, peak and roof profiles. Most edge detection schemes
  ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection
  and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed,
  along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant
  gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic
  filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance
  criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses
  of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A
  two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being
  able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation
  of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without
  rounding. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>
