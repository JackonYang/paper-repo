paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThis book is a comprehensive introduction to\
  \ the neural network models currently under intensive study for computational applications.\
  \ It is a detailed, logically-developed treatment that covers the theory and uses\
  \ of collective computational networks, including associative memory, feed forward\
  \ networks, and unsupervised learning. It also provides coverage of neural network\
  \ applications in a variety of problems of both theoretical and practical interest."
