paperAbstract: Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) are stationary and
  feedforward. They neither change their parameters during evaluation nor use feedback
  from higher to lower layers. Real brains, however, do. So does our Deep Attention
  Selective Network (dasNet) architecture. DasNets feedback structure can dynamically
  alter its convolutional filter sensitivities during classification. It harnesses
  the power of sequential processing to improve classification performance, by allowing
  the network to iteratively focus its internal attention on some of its convolutional
  filters. Feedback is trained through direct policy search in a huge million-dimensional
  parameter space, through scalable natural evolution strategies (SNES). On the CIFAR-10
  and CIFAR-100 datasets, dasNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model.
