paperAbstract: 'specifically on the difficulty of recognizing learning versus language
  difficulties, that is, how to identify a nonnative-speaking child''s need for special
  education services. They propose a model that administrators can employ that minimizes
  bias. In a similar vein, the next chapter, by Jeffery Braden and Sandra Fradd, suggests
  ways that administrators can anticipate difficulties and intervene before such referrals
  are necessary. William Tikunoff, in the eighth chapter, focuses on instructional
  leadership. He discusses the characteristics of an effective principal and targets
  specific areas, such as effective time management. The final chapter, by Beatrice
  Ward, addresses the greatest resource of any educational institution: the teachers.
  She describes the clinical approach to teacher development and how it can be implemented.
  Overall, this book fills a need for basic, factual information about legal requirements,
  program types, and effective instructional and leadership strategies with respect
  to the LEP population. Furthermore, it provides guidance on the complex issue of
  special education for LEP students, particularly the referral process. An additional
  chapter exploring different models for assessment and program design for these students
  would have provided depth and balance. Although there is necessarily some overlap
  between the chapters, it is reinforcing, not repetitive. In addition to being extremely
  useful to administrators, this book would be of value to school personnel such as
  psychologists, special education consultants, LEP consultants, instructors-in short,
  for anyone committed to the design and delivery of effective instructional programs
  for LEP students.'
