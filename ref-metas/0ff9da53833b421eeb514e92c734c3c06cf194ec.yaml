paperAbstract: Support vector machines have demonstrated excellent results in pattern
  recognition tasks and 3D object recognition. We confirm some of the results in 3D
  object recognition and compare it to other object recognition systems. We use different
  pixel-level representations to perform the experiments, while we extend the setting
  to the more challenging and practical case when only a limited number of views of
  the object are presented during training. We report high correct classification
  of unseen views, especially considering that no domain knowledge is including into
  the proposed system. Finally, we suggest an active learning algorithm to reduce
  further the required number of training views.
