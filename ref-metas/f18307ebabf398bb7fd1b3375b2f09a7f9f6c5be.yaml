paperAbstract: "These notes cover the basic definitions of discrete probability theory,\
  \ and then present some results including Bayes' rule, inclusion-exclusion formula,\
  \ Chebyshev's inequality, and the weak law of large numbers. 1 Sample spaces and\
  \ events To treat probability rigorously, we define a sample space S whose elements\
  \ are the possible outcomes of some process or experiment. For example, the sample\
  \ space might be the outcomes of the roll of a die, or flips of a coin. To each\
  \ element x of the sample space, we assign a probability, which will be a non-negative\
  \ number between 0 and 1, which we will denote by p(x). We require that x\u2208\
  S p(x) = 1, so the total probability of the elements of our sample space is 1. What\
  \ this means intuitively is that when we perform our process, exactly one of the\
  \ things in our sample space will happen. Example. The sample space could be S =\
  \ {a, b, c}, and the probabilities could be p(a) = 1/2, p(b) = 1/3, p(c) = 1/6.\
  \ If all elements of our sample space have equal probabilities, we call this the\
  \ uniform probability distribution on our sample space. For example, if our sample\
  \ space was the outcomes of a die roll, the sample space could be denoted S = {x\
  \ 1 , x 2 ,. .. , x 6 }, where the event x i correspond to rolling i. The uniform\
  \ distribution, in which every outcome x i has probability 1/6 describes the situation\
  \ for a fair die. Similarly, if we consider tossing a fair coin, the outcomes would\
  \ be H (heads) and T (tails), each with probability 1/2. In this situation we have\
  \ the uniform probability distribution on the sample space S = {H, T }. We define\
  \ an event A to be a subset of the sample space. For example, in the roll of a die,\
  \ if the event A was rolling an even number, then A = {x 2 , x 4 , x 6 }. The probability\
  \ of an event A, denoted by P(A), is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding\
  \ elements in the sample space. For rolling an even number, we have P(A) = p(x 2)\
  \ + p(x 4) + p(x 6) = 1 2 Given an event A of our sample space, there is a complementary\
  \ event which consists of all points in our sample space that are not \u2026"
