paperAbstract: BackgroundThe functions of chemical compounds and drugs that affect
  biological processes and their particular effect on the onset and treatment of diseases
  have attracted increasing interest with the advancement of research in the life
  sciences. To extract knowledge from the extensive literatures on such compounds
  and drugs, the organizers of BioCreative IV administered the CHEMical Compound and
  Drug Named Entity Recognition (CHEMDNER) task to establish a standard dataset for
  evaluating state-of-the-art chemical entity recognition methods.MethodsThis study
  introduces the approach of our CHEMDNER system. Instead of emphasizing the development
  of novel feature sets for machine learning, this study investigates the effect of
  various tag schemes on the recognition of the names of chemicals and drugs by using
  conditional random fields. Experiments were conducted using combinations of different
  tokenization strategies and tag schemes to investigate the effects of tag set selection
  and tokenization method on the CHEMDNER task.ResultsThis study presents the performance
  of CHEMDNER of three more representative tag schemes-IOBE, IOBES, and IOB12E-when
  applied to a widely utilized IOB tag set and combined with the coarse-/fine-grained
  tokenization methods. The experimental results thus reveal that the fine-grained
  tokenization strategy performance best in terms of precision, recall and F-scores
  when the IOBES tag set was utilized. The IOBES model with fine-grained tokenization
  yielded the best-F-scores in the six chemical entity categories other than the "Multiple"
  entity category. Nonetheless, no significant improvement was observed when a more
  representative tag schemes was used with the coarse or fine-grained tokenization
  rules. The best F-scores that were achieved using the developed system on the test
  dataset of the CHEMDNER task were 0.833 and 0.815 for the chemical documents indexing
  and the chemical entity mention recognition tasks, respectively.ConclusionsThe results
  herein highlight the importance of tag set selection and the use of different tokenization
  strategies. Fine-grained tokenization combined with the tag set IOBES most effectively
  recognizes chemical and drug names. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
  investigation is the first comprehensive investigation use of various tag set schemes
  combined with different tokenization strategies for the recognition of chemical
  entities.
