paperAbstract: Recently, methods based on local image features have shown promise
  for texture and object recognition tasks. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation
  of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms)
  of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support
  Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing
  distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first
  evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors,
  as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation
  with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object
  databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported
  results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate
  the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive
  tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information
  is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions
  of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object
  images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class
  variations and substantial background clutter.
