paperAbstract: In this paper we present Discriminative Random Fields (DRF), a discriminative
  framework for the classification of natural image regions by incorporating neighborhood
  spatial dependencies in the labels as well as the observed data. The proposed model
  exploits local discriminative models and allows to relax the assumption of conditional
  independence of the observed data given the labels, commonly used in the Markov
  Random Field (MRF) framework. The parameters of the DRF model are learned using
  penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model
  allows the MAP inference for binary classification problems using the graph min-cut
  algorithms. The performance of the model was verified on the synthetic as well as
  the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments.
