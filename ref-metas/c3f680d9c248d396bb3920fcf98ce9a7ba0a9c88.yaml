paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nProbabilistic expert systems are graphical networks\
  \ that support the modelling of uncertainty and decisions in large complex domains,\
  \ while retaining ease of calculation. Building on original research by the authors\
  \ over a number of years, this book gives a thorough and rigorous mathematical treatment\
  \ of the underlying ideas, structures, and algorithms, emphasizing those cases in\
  \ which exact answers are obtainable. The book will be of interest to researchers\
  \ and graduate students in artificial intelligence who desire an understanding of\
  \ the mathematical and statistical basis of probabilistic expert systems, and to\
  \ students and research workers in statistics wanting an introduction to this fascinating\
  \ and rapidly developing field. The careful attention to detail will also make this\
  \ work an important reference source for all those involved in the theory and applications\
  \ of probabilistic expert systems."
