paperAbstract: Many neural network classifiers provide outputs which estimate Bayesian
  a posteriori probabilities. When the estimation is accurate, network outputs can
  be treated as probabilities and sum to one. Simple proofs show that Bayesian probabilities
  are estimated when desired network outputs are 1 of M (one output unity, all others
  zero) and a squared-error or cross-entropy cost function is used. Results of Monte
  Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with
  backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial
  networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of
  Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount
  of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood
  distributions and a priori class probabilities. Interpretation of network outputs
  as Bayesian probabilities allows outputs from multiple networks to be combined for
  higher level decision making, simplifies creation of rejection thresholds, makes
  it possible to compensate for differences between pattern class probabilities in
  training and test data, allows outputs to be used to minimize alternative risk functions,
  and suggests alternative measures of network performance.
