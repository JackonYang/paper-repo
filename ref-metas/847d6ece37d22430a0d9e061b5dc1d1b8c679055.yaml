paperAbstract: 'Neural network algorithms have proven useful for recognition of individual,
  segmented characters. However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the
  accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation
  algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy.
  The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character
  until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is
  segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments
  and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features:
  it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent
  information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive
  fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping
  handprinted numerals.'
