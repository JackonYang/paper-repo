paperAbstract: A vision system has been developed which can determine the position
  and orientation of complex curved objects in gray-level noisy scenes. The system
  organizes and reduces the image data from a digitized picture to a compact representation
  having the appearance of a line drawing. This compact image representation can be
  used for forming a model under favorable viewing conditions or for locating a part
  under poor viewing conditions by a matching process that uses a previously formed
  model. Thus, models are formed automatically by having the program view the part
  under favorable lighting and background conditions. The compact image representation
  describes the boundaries of the part.
