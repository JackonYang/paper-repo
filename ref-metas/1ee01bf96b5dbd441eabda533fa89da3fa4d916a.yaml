paperAbstract: The recognition of human movements such as walking, running or climbing
  has been approached previously by tracking a number of feature points and either
  classifying the trajectories directly or matching them with a high-level model of
  the movement. A major difficulty with these methods is acquiring and trading the
  requisite feature points, which are generally specific joints such as knees or angles.
  This requires previous recognition and/or part segmentation of the actor. We show
  that the recognition of walking or any repetitive motion activity can be accomplished
  on the basis of bottom up processing, which does not require the prior identification
  of specific parts, or classification of the actor. In particular, we demonstrate
  that repetitive motion is such a strong cue, that the moving actor can be segmented,
  normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatiotemporal
  template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize
  and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences.<<ETX>>
