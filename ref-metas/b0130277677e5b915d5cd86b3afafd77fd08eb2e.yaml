paperAbstract: The description of a novel type of m-gram language model is given.
  The model offers, via a nonlinear recursive procedure, a computation and space efficient
  solution to the problem of estimating probabilities from sparse data. This solution
  compares favorably to other proposed methods. While the method has been developed
  for and successfully implemented in the IBM Real Time Speech Recognizers, its generality
  makes it applicable in other areas where the problem of estimating probabilities
  from sparse data arises.
