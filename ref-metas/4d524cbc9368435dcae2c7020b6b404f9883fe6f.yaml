paperAbstract: 'In this paper we present two contributions to improve accuracy and
  speed of an image search system based on bag-of-features: a contextual dissimilarity
  measure (CDM) and an efficient search structure for visual word vectors. Our measure
  (CDM) takes into account the local distribution of the vectors and iteratively estimates
  distance correcting terms. These terms are subsequently used to update an existing
  distance, thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimental results on
  the Nister-Stewenius dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the
  state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Our efficient search structure for visual
  word vectors is a two-level scheme using inverted files. The first level partitions
  the image set into clusters of images. At query time, only a subset of clusters
  of the second level has to be searched. This method allows fast querying in large
  sets of images. We evaluate the gain in speed and the loss in accuracy on large
  datasets (up to 500k images).'
