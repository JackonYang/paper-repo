paperAbstract: Local space-time features have recently become a popular video representation
  for action recognition. Several methods for feature localization and description
  have been proposed in the literature and promising recognition results were demonstrated
  for a number of action classes. The comparison of existing methods, however, is
  often limited given the different experimental settings used. The purpose of this
  paper is to evaluate and compare previously proposed space-time features in a common
  experimental setup. In particular, we consider four different feature detectors
  and six local feature descriptors and use a standard bag-of-features SVM approach
  for action recognition. We investigate the performance of these methods on a total
  of 25 action classes distributed over three datasets with varying difficulty. Among
  interesting conclusions, we demonstrate that regular sampling of space-time features
  consistently outperforms all tested space-time interest point detectors for human
  actions in realistic settings. We also demonstrate a consistent ranking for the
  majority of methods over different datasets and discuss their advantages and limitations.
