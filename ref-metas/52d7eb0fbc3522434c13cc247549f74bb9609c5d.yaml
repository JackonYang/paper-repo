paperAbstract: Face detection is one of the most studied topics in the computer vision
  community. Much of the progresses have been made by the availability of face detection
  benchmark datasets. We show that there is a gap between current face detection performance
  and the real world requirements. To facilitate future face detection research, we
  introduce the WIDER FACE dataset1, which is 10 times larger than existing datasets.
  The dataset contains rich annotations, including occlusions, poses, event categories,
  and face bounding boxes. Faces in the proposed dataset are extremely challenging
  due to large variations in scale, pose and occlusion, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore,
  we show that WIDER FACE dataset is an effective training source for face detection.
  We benchmark several representative detection systems, providing an overview of
  state-of-the-art performance and propose a solution to deal with large scale variation.
  Finally, we discuss common failure cases that worth to be further investigated.
