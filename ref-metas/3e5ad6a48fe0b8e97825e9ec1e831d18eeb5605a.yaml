paperAbstract: A scheme is developed for classifying the types of motion perceived
  by a humanlike robot. It is assumed that the robot receives visual images of the
  scene using a perspective system model. Equations, theorems, concepts, clues, etc.,
  relating the objects, their positions, and their motion to their images on the focal
  plane are presented.<<ETX>>
