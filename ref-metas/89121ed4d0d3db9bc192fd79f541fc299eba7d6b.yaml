paperAbstract: Computer vision researchers are developing new approaches to object
  recognition and detection that are based almost directly on images and avoid the
  use of intermediate three-dimensional models. Many of these techniques depend on
  a representation of images that induces a linear vector space structure and in principle
  requires dense feature correspondence. This image representation allows the use
  of learning techniques for the analysis of images (for computer vision) as well
  as for the synthesis of images (for computer graphics).
