paperAbstract: "Information extraction (IE) holds the promise of generating a large-scale\
  \ knowledge base from the Web's natural language text. Knowledge-based weak supervision,\
  \ using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards\
  \ this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number\
  \ of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning\
  \ algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling,\
  \ but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract\
  \ the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). \n \nThis paper presents\
  \ a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines\
  \ a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating\
  \ the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text\
  \ using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs\
  \ quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence\
  \ level."
