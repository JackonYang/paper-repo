paperAbstract: A new exemplar-based, probabilistic paradigm for visual tracking is
  presented. Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of
  information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected
  representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture
  distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction
  of object models and problems with changes of topology. Using exemplars in place
  of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call
  the "Metric Mixture" (M/sup 2/) approach. The M/sup 2/ model has several valuable
  properties. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms
  by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly,
  it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates
  any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence. Experiments
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the M/sup 2/ model in two domains tracking walking
  people using chamfer distances on binary edge images and tracking mouth movements
  by means of a shuffle distance.
