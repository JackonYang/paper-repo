paperAbstract: This paper describes a method for finding the rectangle of minimum
  area in which a given arbitrary plane curve can be contained. The method is of interest
  in certain packing and optimum layout problems. It consists of first determining
  the minimal-perimeter convex polygon that encloses the given curve and then selecting
  the rectangle of minimum area capable of containing this polygon. Three theorems
  are introduced to show that one side of the minimum-area rectangle must be collinear
  with an edge of the enclosed polygon and that the minimum-area encasing rectangle
  for the convex polygon is also the minimum-area rectangle for the curve.
