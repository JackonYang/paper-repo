paperAbstract: 'We propose and implement a robust text detection system, which is
  a prominent step-in for text retrieval in natural scene images or videos. Our system
  includes several key components: (1) A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed
  to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as character candidates using the strategy
  of minimizing regularized variations. (2) Character candidates are grouped into
  text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights
  and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance
  metric learning algorithm. (3) The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding
  to non-text are estimated with an character classifier; text candidates with high
  probabilities are then eliminated and finally texts are identified with a text classifier.
  The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset
  and a publicly available multilingual dataset; the f measures are over 76% and 74%
  which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art performances of 71% and
  65%, respectively.'
