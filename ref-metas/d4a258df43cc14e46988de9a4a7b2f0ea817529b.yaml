paperAbstract: "Statistical machine translation systems are based on one or more translation\
  \ models and a language model of the target language. While many different translation\
  \ models and phrase extraction algorithms have been proposed, a standard word n-gram\
  \ back-off language model is used in most systems. \n \nIn this work, we propose\
  \ to use a new statistical language model that is based on a continuous representation\
  \ of the words in the vocabulary. A neural network is used to perform the projection\
  \ and the probability estimation. We consider the translation of European Parliament\
  \ Speeches. This task is part of an international evaluation organized by the TC-STAR\
  \ project in 2006. The proposed method achieves consistent improvements in the BLEU\
  \ score on the development and test data. \n \nWe also present algorithms to improve\
  \ the estimation of the language model probabilities when splitting long sentences\
  \ into shorter chunks."
