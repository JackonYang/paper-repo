paperAbstract: Cheap and versatile cameras make it possible to easily and quickly
  capture a wide variety of documents. However, low resolution cameras present a challenge
  to OCR because it is virtually impossible to do character segmentation independently
  from recognition. In this paper we solve these problems simultaneously by applying
  methods borrowed from cursive handwriting recognition. To achieve maximum robustness,
  we use a machine learning approach based on a convolutional neural network. When
  our system is combined with a language model using dynamic programming, the overall
  performance is in the vicinity of 80-95% word accuracy on pages captured with a
  1024/spl times/768 webcam and 10-point text.
