paperAbstract: The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning
  an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which
  is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in
  the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function
  for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2,
  * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42
  dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends
  to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some
  extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the
  k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that
  it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications
  include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate
  distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables.
  In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means
  has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization
  of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic
  behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the
  k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good
  portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main
  results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The
  rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes
  several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from
  computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means
  idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4.
  The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems
  in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special
