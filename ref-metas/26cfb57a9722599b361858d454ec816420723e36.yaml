paperAbstract: 'Recent Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models have revolutionized
  vision-and-language (V+L) research. Models such as ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER have
  significantly lifted state of the art across a wide range of V+L benchmarks with
  joint image-text pre-training. However, little is known about the inner mechanisms
  that destine their impressive success. To reveal the secrets behind the scene of
  these powerful models, we present VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation),
  a set of meticulously designed probing tasks (e.g., Visual Coreference Resolution,
  Visual Relation Detection, Linguistic Probing Tasks) generalizable to standard pre-trained
  V+L models, aiming to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g.,
  the implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, the inherent cross-modal
  alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings). Through extensive
  analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these probing tasks, our key
  observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a propensity for attending over
  text rather than images during inference. (ii) There exists a subset of attention
  heads that are tailored for capturing cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention
  matrix in pre-trained models demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment
  between image regions and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal
  visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic knowledge
  is also effectively encoded in the attention heads. These are valuable insights
  serving to guide future work towards designing better model architecture and objectives
  for multimodal pre-training.'
