paperAbstract: We report on the third international Competition on Handwritten Mathematical
  Expression Recognition (CROHME), in which eight teams from academia and industry
  took part. For the third CROHME, the training dataset was expanded to over 8000
  expressions, and new tools were developed for evaluating performance at the level
  of strokes as well as expressions and symbols. As an informal measure of progress,
  the performance of the participating systems on the CROHME 2012 data set is also
  reported. Data and tools used for the competition will be made publicly available.
