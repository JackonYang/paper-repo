paperAbstract: The authors introduce a physically correct model of elastic nonrigid
  motion. This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees
  of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation
  modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion
  that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion
  is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters
  involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates
  of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates
  can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable
  and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity.
  The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples
  of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented.
