paperAbstract: This paper describes a new statistical parser which is based on probabilities
  of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree. Standard bigram probability
  estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between
  pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs
  at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94), which has the best
  published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach
  means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search
  strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible
  loss in accuracy.
