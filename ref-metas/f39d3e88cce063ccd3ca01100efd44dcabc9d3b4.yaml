paperAbstract: Automatic linguistic indexing of pictures is an important but highly
  challenging problem for researchers in computer vision and content-based image retrieval.
  In this paper, we introduce a statistical modeling approach to this problem. Categorized
  images are used to train a dictionary of hundreds of statistical models each representing
  a concept. Images of any given concept are regarded as instances of a stochastic
  process that characterizes the concept. To measure the extent of association between
  an image and the textual description of a concept, the likelihood of the occurrence
  of the image based on the characterizing stochastic process is computed. A high
  likelihood indicates a strong association. In our experimental implementation, we
  focus on a particular group of stochastic processes, that is, the two-dimensional
  multiresolution hidden Markov models (2D MHMMs). We implemented and tested our ALIP
  (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures) system on a photographic image database
  of 600 different concepts, each with about 40 training images. The system is evaluated
  quantitatively using more than 4,600 images outside the training database and compared
  with a random annotation scheme. Experiments have demonstrated the good accuracy
  of the system and its high potential in linguistic indexing of photographic images.
