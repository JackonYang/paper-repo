paperAbstract: "The striate cortex of the macaque monkey is subdivided into two independent\
  \ and overlapping systems of columns termed \u201Corientation columns\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cocular dominance columns.\u201D The present paper is concerned with the\
  \ orientation columns, particularly their geometry and the relationship between\
  \ successive columns. The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great\
  \ majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations\
  \ of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise\
  \ direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight\
  \ lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were\
  \ often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from\
  \ clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals\
  \ occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\xB0 were frequently\
  \ seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation\
  \ shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating\
  \ that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u2013\
  50 \u03BC, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations\
  \ that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track\
  \ distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation\
  \ are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of\
  \ about 10\xB0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation\
  \ persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of\
  \ discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation\
  \ in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely\
  \ ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large\
  \ shift in orientation of up to 90\xB0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly\
  \ every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple\
  \ parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03BC the slopes of the orientation\
  \ vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations\
  \ indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing\
  \ perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\xB0 took place\
  \ over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation,\
  \ and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to\
  \ be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\xB0 and 15\xB0 from the fovea.\
  \ A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed\
  \ similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."
