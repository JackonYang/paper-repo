paperAbstract: The prevalent scene text detection approach follows four sequential
  steps comprising character candidate detection, false character candidate removal,
  text line extraction, and text line verification. However, errors occur and accumulate
  throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance.
  To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely
  Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character
  candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates
  the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation
  problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique
  has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset
  and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all
  three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the
  multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection
  of texts in different languages.
