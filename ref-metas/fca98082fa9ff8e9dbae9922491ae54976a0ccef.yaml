paperAbstract: The authors introduce an index of resolvability that is proved to bound
  the rate of convergence of minimum complexity density estimators as well as the
  information-theoretic redundancy of the corresponding total description length.
  The results on the index of resolvability demonstrate the statistical effectiveness
  of the minimum description-length principle as a method of inference. The minimum
  complexity estimator converges to true density nearly as fast as an estimator based
  on prior knowledge of the true subclass of densities. Interpretations and basic
  properties of minimum complexity estimators are discussed. Some regression and classification
  problems that can be examined from the minimum description-length framework are
  considered. >
