paperAbstract: 'We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes
  the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does
  not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the
  zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties
  not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer
  function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and
  perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output
  representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components
  in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We
  apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully
  separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on
  the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of
  unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies
  of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization
  provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.'
