paperAbstract: Abstract. In this paper we describe a database that consists of handwritten
  English sentences. It is based on the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus. This corpus
  is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database
  includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of
  82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection.
  The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety
  of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would
  be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the
  lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from
  the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures
  for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text
  into lines and words.
