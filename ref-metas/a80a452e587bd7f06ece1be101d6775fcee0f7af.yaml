paperAbstract: We survey the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) in speech
  recognition. We show that WFSTs provide a common and natural representation for
  hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency, pronunciation dictionaries, grammars,
  and alternative recognition outputs. Furthermore, general transducer operations
  combine these representations flexibly and efficiently. Weighted determinization
  and minimization algorithms optimize their time and space requirements, and a weight
  pushing algorithm distributes the weights along the paths of a weighted transducer
  optimally for speech recognition. As an example, we describe a North American Business
  News (NAB) recognition system built using these techniques that combines the HMMs,
  full cross-word triphones, a lexicon of 40 000 words, and a large trigram grammar
  into a single weighted transducer that is only somewhat larger than the trigram
  word grammar and that runs NAB in real-time on a very simple decoder. In another
  example, we show that the same techniques can be used to optimize lattices for second-pass
  recognition. In a third example, we show how general automata operations can be
  used to assemble lattices from different recognizers to improve recognition performance.
