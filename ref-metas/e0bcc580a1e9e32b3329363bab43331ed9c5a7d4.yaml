paperAbstract: Algorithms for discrete energy minimization are of fundamental importance
  in computer vision. In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by
  Wainwright et al. (Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW).
  It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However,
  the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down.
  In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm
  which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that
  the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition
  which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We
  prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally,
  we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message
  passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and
  real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and
  tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition,
  on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph
  cuts
