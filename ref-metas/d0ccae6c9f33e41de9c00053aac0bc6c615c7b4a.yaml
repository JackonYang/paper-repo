paperAbstract: We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural language, which
  we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve
  ambiguity. HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information
  from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus
  of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building
  to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct
  parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar
  tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct
  parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic
  parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG,
  increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.
