paperAbstract: The functional architecture of mammalian visual cortex has been elucidated
  in impressive detail by experimental work of the past 20-25 years. The origin of
  many of the salient features of this architecture, however, has remained unexplained.
  This paper is the first of three (the others will appear in subsequent issues of
  these Proceedings) that address the origin and organization of feature-analyzing
  (spatial-opponent and orientation-selective) cells in simple systems governed by
  biologically plausible development rules. I analyze the progressive maturation of
  a system composed of a few layers of cells, with connections that develop according
  to a simple set of rules (including Hebb-type modification). To understand the prenatal
  origin of orientation-selective cells in certain primates, I consider the case in
  which there is no external input, with the first layer exhibiting random spontaneous
  electrical activity. No orientation preference is specified to the system at any
  stage, and none of the basic developmental rules is specific to visual processing.
  Here I introduce the theory of "modular self-adaptive networks," of which this system
  is an example, and explicitly demonstrate the emergence of a layer of spatial-opponent
  cells. This sets the stage for the emergence, in succeeding layers, of an orientation-selective
  cell population.
