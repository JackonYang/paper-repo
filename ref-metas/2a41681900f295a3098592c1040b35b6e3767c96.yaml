paperAbstract: We present here SIMPLIcity (semantics-sensitive integrated matching
  for picture libraries), an image retrieval system, which uses semantics classification
  methods, a wavelet-based approach for feature extraction, and integrated region
  matching based upon image segmentation. An image is represented by a set of regions,
  roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape,
  and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially,
  the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching
  methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the
  overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that
  integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity
  to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better
  and faster than existing ones. The system is fairly robust to image alterations.
