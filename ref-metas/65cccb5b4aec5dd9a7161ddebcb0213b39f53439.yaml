paperAbstract: In this paper we study interest point descriptors for image matching
  and 3D reconstruction. We examine the building blocks of descriptor algorithms and
  evaluate numerous combinations of components. Various published descriptors such
  as SIFT, GLOH, and Spin images can be cast into our framework. For each candidate
  algorithm we learn good choices for parameters using a training set consisting of
  patches from a multi-image 3D reconstruction where accurate ground-truth matches
  are known. The best descriptors were those with log polar histogramming regions
  and feature vectors constructed from rectified outputs of steerable quadrature filters.
  At a 95% detection rate these gave one third of the incorrect matches produced by
  SIFT.
