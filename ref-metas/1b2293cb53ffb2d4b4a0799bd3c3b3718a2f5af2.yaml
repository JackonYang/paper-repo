paperAbstract: Detecting incidental scene text is a challenging task because of multi-orientation,
  perspective distortion, and variation of text size, color and scale. Retrospective
  research has only focused on using rectangular bounding box or horizontal sliding
  window to localize text, which may result in redundant background noise, unnecessary
  overlap or even information loss. To address these issues, we propose a new Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs) based method, named Deep Matching Prior Network (DMPNet),
  to detect text with tighter quadrangle. First, we use quadrilateral sliding windows
  in several specific intermediate convolutional layers to roughly recall the text
  with higher overlapping area and then a shared Monte-Carlo method is proposed for
  fast and accurate computing of the polygonal areas. After that, we designed a sequential
  protocol for relative regression which can exactly predict text with compact quadrangle.
  Moreover, a auxiliary smooth Ln loss is also proposed for further regressing the
  position of text, which has better overall performance than L2 loss and smooth L1
  loss in terms of robustness and stability. The effectiveness of our approach is
  evaluated on a public word-level, multi-oriented scene text database, ICDAR 2015
  Robust Reading Competition Challenge 4 Incidental scene text localization. The performance
  of our method is evaluated by using F-measure and found to be 70.64%, outperforming
  the existing state-of-the-art method with F-measure 63.76%.
