paperAbstract: Overlay text brings important semantic clues in video content analysis
  such as video information retrieval and summarization, since the content of the
  scene or the editor's intention can be well represented by using inserted text.
  Most of the previous approaches to extracting overlay text from videos are based
  on low-level features, such as edge, color, and texture information. However, existing
  methods experience difficulties in handling texts with various contrasts or inserted
  in a complex background. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to detect and
  extract the overlay text from the video scene. Based on our observation that there
  exist transient colors between inserted text and its adjacent background, a transition
  map is first generated. Then candidate regions are extracted by a reshaping method
  and the overlay text regions are determined based on the occurrence of overlay text
  in each candidate. The detected overlay text regions are localized accurately using
  the projection of overlay text pixels in the transition map and the text extraction
  is finally conducted. The proposed method is robust to different character size,
  position, contrast, and color. It is also language independent. Overlay text region
  update between frames is also employed to reduce the processing time. Experiments
  are performed on diverse videos to confirm the efficiency of the proposed method.
