paperAbstract: Extracting key information from documents, such as receipts or invoices,
  and preserving the interested texts to structured data is crucial in the document-intensive
  streamline processes of office automation in areas that includes but not limited
  to accounting, financial, and taxation areas. To avoid designing expert rules for
  each specific type of document, some published works attempt to tackle the problem
  by learning a model to explore the semantic context in text sequences based on the
  Named Entity Recognition (NER) method in the NLP field. In this paper, we propose
  to harness the effective information from both semantic meaning and spatial distribution
  of texts in documents. Specifically, our proposed model, Convolutional Universal
  Text Information Extractor (CUTIE), applies convolutional neural networks on gridded
  texts where texts are embedded as features with semantical connotations. We further
  explore the effect of employing different structures of convolutional neural network
  and propose a fast and portable structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method on a dataset with up to $4,484$ labelled receipts, without any pre-training
  or post-processing, achieving state of the art performance that is much better than
  the NER based methods in terms of either speed and accuracy. Experimental results
  also demonstrate that the proposed CUTIE model being able to achieve good performance
  with a much smaller amount of training data.
