paperAbstract: At ACM SIGIR '94, I compared the effectiveness of uncertainty sampling
  with that of random sampling and relevance sampling in choosing training data for
  a text categorization data set [1]. (Relevance sampling is the application of relevance
  feedback [3] to producing a training sample.) I have discovered a bug in my experimental
  software which caused the relevance sampling results reported in the SIGIR '94 paper
  to be incorrect. (The uncertainty sampling and random sampling results in that paper
  were correct.) I have since fixed the bug and rerun the experiments. This note presents
  the corrected results, along with additional data supporting the original claim
  that uncertainty sampling has an advantage over relevance sampling in most training
  situations.
