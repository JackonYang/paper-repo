paperAbstract: Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally efficient procedure
  for detecting lines in pictures. This paper points out that the use of angle-radius
  rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further. It also
  shows how the method can be used for more general curve fitting, and gives alternative
  interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency.
