paperAbstract: Theano is a linear algebra compiler that optimizes a user's symbolically-specified
  mathematical computations to produce efficient low-level implementations. In this
  paper, we present new features and efficiency improvements to Theano, and benchmarks
  demonstrating Theano's performance relative to Torch7, a recently introduced machine
  learning library, and to RNNLM, a C++ library targeted at recurrent neural networks.
