paperAbstract: The concept of Contrastive Learning (CL) is developed as a family of
  possible learning algorithms for neural networks. CL is an extension of Deterministic
  Boltzmann Machines to more general dynamical systems. During learning, the network
  oscillates between two phases. One phase has a teacher signal and one phase has
  no teacher signal. The weights are updated using a learning rule that corresponds
  to gradient descent on a contrast function that measures the discrepancy between
  the free network and the network with a teacher signal. The CL approach provides
  a general unified framework for developing new learning algorithms. It also shows
  that many different types of clamping and teacher signals are possible. Several
  examples are given and an analysis of the landscape of the contrast function is
  proposed with some relevant predictions for the CL curves. An approach that may
  be suitable for collective analog implementations is described. Simulation results
  and possible extensions are briefly discussed together with a new conjecture regarding
  the function of certain oscillations in the brain. In the appendix, we also examine
  two extensions of contrastive learning to time-dependent trajectories.
