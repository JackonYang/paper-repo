paperAbstract: "Simulated annealing\u2014moving from a tractable distribution to a\
  \ distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions\u2014has\
  \ traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov\
  \ chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions\
  \ for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain\
  \ aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems,\
  \ where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult,\
  \ while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge\
  \ to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed\
  \ importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied\
  \ tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed\
  \ variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic\
  \ integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance\
  \ sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates\
  \ of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful,\
  \ since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing\
  \ convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers."
