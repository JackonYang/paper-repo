paperAbstract: This paper investigates the problem of image-caption retrieval using
  joint visualsemantic embeddings. We introduce a very simple change to the loss function
  used in the original formulation by Kiros et al. (2014), which leads to drastic
  improvements in the retrieval performance. In particular, the original paper uses
  the rank loss which computes the sum of violations across the negative training
  examples. Instead, we penalize the model according to the hardest negative examples.
  We then make several additional modifications according to the current best practices
  in image-caption retrieval. We showcase our model on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets
  through comparisons and ablation studies. On MS-COCO, we improve caption retrieval
  by 21% in R@1 with respect to the original formulation. Our results outperform the
  state-of-the-art results by 8.8% in caption retrieval and 11.3% in image retrieval
  at R@1. On Flickr30K, we more than double R@1 as reported by Kiros et al. (2014)
  in both image and caption retrieval, and achieve near state-of-the-art performance.
  We further show that similar improvements also apply to the Order-embeddings by
  Vendrov et al. (2015) which builds on a similar loss function.
