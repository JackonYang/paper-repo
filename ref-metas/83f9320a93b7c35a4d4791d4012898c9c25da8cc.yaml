paperAbstract: "1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of\
  \ 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared\
  \ anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves\
  \ using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by\
  \ a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either\
  \ by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency,\
  \ or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating\
  \ that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar\
  \ tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these\
  \ 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of\
  \ preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3\u2010\u20103 c/deg, and\
  \ their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half\u2010\
  amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex\
  \ cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency,\
  \ although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency\
  \ than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty\u2010four neurones from area 18,\
  \ and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions\
  \ of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area\
  \ 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those\
  \ preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range\
  \ of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields\
  \ within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The\
  \ distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non\u2010\
  overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined.\
  \ Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones\
  \ in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some\
  \ neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen.\
  \ Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less\
  \ well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones\
  \ recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly\
  \ showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved\
  \ either above or below some optimum value (usually 2\u2010\u20108 Hz). 6. We conclude\
  \ from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects\
  \ of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex.\
  \ Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance\
  \ of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17..."
