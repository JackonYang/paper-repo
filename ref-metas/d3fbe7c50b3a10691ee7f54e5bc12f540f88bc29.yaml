paperAbstract: Proposes an approach for automatically generating a decision tree which
  is applied as a model for the logical labeling of business letters. Instead of top-down
  determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set
  of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The
  learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall
  structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood).
  The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations
  from a neighborhood. Consequently, heuristics are learned for structurally discriminating
  documents during subsequent classification.<<ETX>>
