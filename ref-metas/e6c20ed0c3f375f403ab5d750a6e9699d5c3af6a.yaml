paperAbstract: This paper presents a general, trainable system for object detection
  in unconstrained, cluttered scenes. The system derives much of its power from a
  representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary
  of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently
  computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly
  derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier
  using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face,
  people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify
  how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate
  representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time
  application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system.
