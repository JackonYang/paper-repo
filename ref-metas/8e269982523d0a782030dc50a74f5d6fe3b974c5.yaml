paperAbstract: "We present a neural network model \u2014 based on Convolutional Neural\
  \ Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and a novel attention mechanism \u2014 which\
  \ achieves 84.2% accuracy on the challenging French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset,\
  \ significantly outperforming the previous state of the art (Smith'16), which achieved\
  \ 72.46%. Furthermore, our new method is much simpler and more general than the\
  \ previous approach. To demonstrate the generality of our model, we show that it\
  \ also performs well on an even more challenging dataset derived from Google Street\
  \ View, in which the goal is to extract business names from store fronts. Finally,\
  \ we study the speed/accuracy tradeoff that results from using CNN feature extractors\
  \ of different depths. Surprisingly, we find that deeper is not always better (in\
  \ terms of accuracy, as well as speed). Our resulting model is simple, accurate\
  \ and fast, allowing it to be used at scale on a variety of challenging real-world\
  \ text extraction problems."
