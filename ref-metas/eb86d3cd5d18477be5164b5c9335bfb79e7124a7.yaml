paperAbstract: Many computer vision problems are naturally formulated as random fields,
  specifically MRFs or CRFs. The introduction of graph cuts has enabled efficient
  and optimal inference in associative random fields, greatly advancing applications
  such as segmentation, stereo reconstruction and many others. However, while fast
  inference is now widespread, parameter learning in random fields has remained an
  intractable problem. This paper shows how to apply fast inference algorithms, in
  particular graph cuts, to learn parameters of random fields with similar efficiency.
  We find optimal parameter values under standard regularized objective functions
  that ensure good generalization. Our algorithm enables learning of many parameters
  in reasonable time, and we explore further speedup techniques. We also discuss extensions
  to non-associative and multi-class problems. We evaluate the method on image segmentation
  and geometry recognition.
