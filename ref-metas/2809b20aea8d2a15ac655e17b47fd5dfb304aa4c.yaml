paperAbstract: "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object\
  \ in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face,\
  \ a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological\
  \ visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by\
  \ artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the\
  \ variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance,\
  \ and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize\
  \ the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from\
  \ cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based\
  \ representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms\
  \ of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a\
  \ large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments\
  \ are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing\
  \ the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the\
  \ purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each\
  \ type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye\
  \ regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects\
  \ fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected\
  \ fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible\
  \ to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination\
  \ and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different\
  \ from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying\
  \ complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment\
  \ types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based\
  \ approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class\
  \ while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships\
  \ between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system\
  \ involved in object perception"
