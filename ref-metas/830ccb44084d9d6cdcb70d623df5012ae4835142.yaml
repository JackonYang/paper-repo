paperAbstract: One of the attractions of neural network approaches to pattern recognition
  is the use of a discrimination-based training method. We show that once we have
  modified the output layer of a multilayer perceptron to provide mathematically correct
  probability distributions, and replaced the usual squared error criterion with a
  probability-based score, the result is equivalent to Maximum Mutual Information
  training, which has been used successfully to improve the performance of hidden
  Markov models for speech recognition. If the network is specially constructed to
  perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier
  then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the
  models. Examples include an HMM-based word discriminator, which we call an 'Alphanet'.
