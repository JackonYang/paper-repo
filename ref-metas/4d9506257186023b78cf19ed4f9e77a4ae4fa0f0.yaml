paperAbstract: "Visual relationships capture a wide variety of interactions between\
  \ pairs of objects in images (e.g. \u201Cman riding bicycle\u201D and \u201Cman\
  \ pushing bicycle\u201D). Consequently, the set of possible relationships is extremely\
  \ large and it is difficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all possible\
  \ relationships. Because of this limitation, previous work on visual relationship\
  \ detection has concentrated on predicting only a handful of relationships. Though\
  \ most relationships are infrequent, their objects (e.g. \u201Cman\u201D and \u201C\
  bicycle\u201D) and predicates (e.g. \u201Criding\u201D and \u201Cpushing\u201D)\
  \ independently occur more frequently. We propose a model that uses this insight\
  \ to train visual models for objects and predicates individually and later combines\
  \ them together to predict multiple relationships per image. We improve on prior\
  \ work by leveraging language priors from semantic word embeddings to finetune the\
  \ likelihood of a predicted relationship. Our model can scale to predict thousands\
  \ of types of relationships from a few examples. Additionally, we localize the objects\
  \ in the predicted relationships as bounding boxes in the image. We further demonstrate\
  \ that understanding relationships can improve content based image retrieval."
