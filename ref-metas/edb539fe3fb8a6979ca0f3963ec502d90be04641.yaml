paperAbstract: 'This paper describes the current state of an experimental document
  recognition system for scientific papers. A scientific paper contains not only text
  but also tables, pictures, graphics, and mathematical expressions. This system can
  convert character or symbol strings in text as well as mathematical expressions
  and tables into coded data. Out of all the functions required for the entire process
  from document scanning through recognition, these have been investigated and implemented:
  skew detection and correction, region (block) segmentation, and mathematical expression
  recognition. The algorithms have been designed for high speed as much as possible.
  This experimental system is implemented entirely in software on a work station under
  X-windows. Some experimental results on each stage of the document recognition process
  are presented.'
