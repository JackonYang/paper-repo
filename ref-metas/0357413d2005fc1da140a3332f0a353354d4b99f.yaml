paperAbstract: Because of the fundamental importance of edges as primitives of pictures,
  automatic edge finding is set as goal. A set of requirements which should be met
  by a local edge recognizer is formulated. Their main concerns are fast and reliable
  recognition in the presence of noise. A unique optimal solution for an edge operator
  results. The operator obtains the best fit of an ideal edge element to any empirically
  obtained edge element. Proof of this is given. A reliability assessment accompanies
  every recognition process.
