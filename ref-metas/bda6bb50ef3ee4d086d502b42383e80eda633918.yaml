paperAbstract: Successful visual object recognition methods typically rely on training
  datasets containing lots of richly annotated images. Annotating object bounding
  boxes is both expensive and subjective. We describe a weakly supervised convolutional
  neural network (CNN) for object recognition that does not rely on detailed object
  annotation and yet returns 86.3% mAP on the Pascal VOC classification task, outperforming
  previous fully-supervised systems by a sizable margin. Despite the lack of bounding
  box supervision, the network produces maps that clearly localize the objects in
  cluttered scenes. We also show that adding fully supervised object examples to our
  weakly supervised setup does not increase the classification performance.
