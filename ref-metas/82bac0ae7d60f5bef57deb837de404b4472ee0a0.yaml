paperAbstract: This paper presents an automatic recognition method for color text
  characters extracted from scene images, which is robust to strong distortions, complex
  background, low resolution and non uniform lightning. Based on a specific architecture
  of convolutional neural networks, the proposed system automatically learns how to
  recognize characters without making any assumptions, without applying any preprocessing
  or post-processing and without using tunable parameters. For this purpose, we use
  a training set of scene text images extracted from the ICDAR 2003 public training
  database. The proposed method is compared to recent character recognition techniques
  for scene images based on the ICDAR 2003 public samples dataset in order to contribute
  to the state-of-the-art method comparison efforts initiated in ICDAR 2003. Experimental
  results show an encouraging average recognition rate of 84.53%, ranging from 93.47%
  for clear images to 67.86% for seriously distorted images.
