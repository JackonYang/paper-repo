paperAbstract: '"Inference" problems arise in statistical physics, computer vision,
  error-correcting coding theory, and AI. We explain the principles behind the belief
  propagation (BP) algorithm, which is an efficient way to solve inference problems
  based on passing local messages. We develop a unified approach, with examples, notation,
  and graphical models borrowed from the relevant disciplines.We explain the close
  connection between the BP algorithm and the Bethe approximation of statistical physics.
  In particular, we show that BP can only converge to a fixed point that is also a
  stationary point of the Bethe approximation to the free energy. This result helps
  explaining the successes of the BP algorithm and enables connections to be made
  with variational approaches to approximate inference.The connection of BP with the
  Bethe approximation also suggests a way to construct new message-passing algorithms
  based on improvements to Bethe''s approximation introduced Kikuchi and others. The
  new generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms are significantly more accurate
  than ordinary BP for some problems. We illustrate how to construct GBP algorithms
  with a detailed example.'
