paperAbstract: 'Libraries and other institutions are interested in providing access
  to scanned versions of their large collections of handwritten historical manuscripts
  on electronic media. Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which
  is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers
  do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has
  been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established
  using image matching. By annotating "interesting" clusters, an index can be built
  automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical
  documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional
  features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental
  results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments
  show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques.'
