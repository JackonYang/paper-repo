paperAbstract: 'We present a novel method, which we refer as an integral histogram,
  to compute the histograms of all possible target regions in a Cartesian data space.
  Our method has three distinct advantages: 1) It is computationally superior to the
  conventional approach. The integral histogram method makes it possible to employ
  even an exhaustive search process in real-time, which was impractical before. 2)
  It can be extended to higher data dimensions, uniform and nonuniform bin formations,
  and multiple target scales without sacrificing its computational advantages. 3)
  It enables the description of higher level histogram features. We exploit the spatial
  arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by
  starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either
  a scan-line or a wave-front. At each step, we update a single bin using the values
  of integral histogram at the previously visited neighboring data points. After the
  integral histogram is propagated, histogram of any target region can be computed
  easily by using simple arithmetic operations.'
