paperAbstract: When the training class patterns {Um} are closely related and they
  are inseparable (according to some targeted binary output vectors {Vm}) by a one-
  layered perceptron (OLP), then {Um} must be linearly dependent, and the output-augmented
  {Um} must be positively, linearly dependent. The learning of this OLP is then impossible
  no matter what learning rules we use, because the solution of the connection matrix
  just does not exist. However, we can always use a parallel-cascaded, two-layered
  perceptron (PCTLP) to realize this inseparable mapping. The design of this PCTLP
  is derived from the positive-linear independency condition we previously studied.
  It is a very intriguing mathematical derivation and the design of the PCTLP is much
  more efficient then that of the conventional series- cascaded, three-layered, neural
  networks. Also its robustness in recognizing any untrained, closely related patterns
  can be controlled and maximized. The physical origin, the theory, and the design
  of this novel, `universal' perceptron pattern recognition system will be discussed
  in detail in this paper.
