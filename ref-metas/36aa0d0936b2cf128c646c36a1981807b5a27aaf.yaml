paperAbstract: We introduce the notion of kernel-alignment, a measure of similarity
  between two kernel functions or between a kernel and a target function. This quantity
  captures the degree of agreement between a kernel and a given learning task, and
  has very natural interpretations in machine learning, leading also to simple algorithms
  for model selection and learning. We analyse its theoretical properties, proving
  that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation
  with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms
  that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing
  that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly
  increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy.
  Hence, the approach provides a principled method of performing transduction.
