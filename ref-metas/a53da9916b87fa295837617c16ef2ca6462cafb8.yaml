paperAbstract: Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
  have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are
  usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide
  a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are
  not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper,
  we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear
  classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs
  which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve
  their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used
  directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate
  how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.
