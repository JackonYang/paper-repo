paperAbstract: "Although large language models are used in speech recognition and\
  \ machine translation applications, OCR systems are \"far behind\"\x9D in their\
  \ use of language models. The reason for this is not the laggardness of the OCR\
  \ community, but the fact that, at high accuracies, a frequency-based language model\
  \ can do more damage than good, unless carefully applied. This paper presents an\
  \ analysis of this discrepancy with the help of the Google Books n-gram Corpus,\
  \ and concludes that noisy-channel models that closely model the underlying classifier\
  \ and segmentation errors are required."
