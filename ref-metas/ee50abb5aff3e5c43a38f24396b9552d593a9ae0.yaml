paperAbstract: The statistical use of a particular classic form of a connectionist
  system, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), is described in the context of the recognition
  of continuous speech. A discriminant hidden Markov model (HMM) is defined, and it
  is shown how a particular MLP with contextual and extra feedback input units can
  be considered as a general form of such a Markov model. A link between these discriminant
  HMMs, trained along the Viterbi algorithm, and any other approach based on least
  mean square minimization of an error function (LMSE) is established. It is shown
  theoretically and experimentally that the outputs of the MLP (when trained along
  the LMSE or the entropy criterion) approximate the probability distribution over
  output classes conditioned on the input, i.e. the maximum a posteriori probabilities.
  Results of a series of speech recognition experiments are reported. The possibility
  of embedding MLP into HMM is described. Relations with other recurrent networks
  are also explained. >
