paperAbstract: Modern models of relation extraction for tasks like ACE are based on
  supervised learning of relations from small hand-labeled corpora. We investigate
  an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain
  dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size.
  Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations,
  to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase
  relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus
  and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines
  the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic
  classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large
  corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations
  at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic
  parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically
  distant in their expression.
