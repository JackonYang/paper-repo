paperAbstract: The algorithm matches edges by minimizing a generalized distance between
  them. The matching is performed in a series of images depicting the same scene with
  different resolutions, i.e. in a resolution pyramid. Using this hierarchical structure
  reduces the computational load significantly. The algorithm is reasonably simple
  to implement and is insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has
  been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first
  application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the
  same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs
  are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective
  changes. The hierarchical chamfer matching algorithm gives correct results using
  a reasonable amount of computational resources in all tested applications. >
