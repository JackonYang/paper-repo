paperAbstract: A program that makes an existing website look like a database is called
  a wrapper. Wrapper learning is the problem of learning website wrappers from examples.
  We present a wrapper-learning system called WL2 that can exploit several different
  representations of a document. Examples of such different representations include
  DOM-level and token-level representations, as well as two-dimensional geometric
  views of the rendered page (for tabular data) and representations of the visual
  appearance of text asm it will be rendered. Additionally, the learning system is
  modular, and can be easily adapted to new domains and tasks. The learning system
  described is part of an "industrial-strength" wrapper management system that is
  in active use at WhizBang Labs. Controlled experiments show that the learner has
  broader coverage and a faster learning rate than earlier wrapper-learning systems.
