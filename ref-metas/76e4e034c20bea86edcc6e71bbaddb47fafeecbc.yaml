paperAbstract: "The meaning of an English word can vary widely depending on which\
  \ sense is intended. Does a fireman feed fires or put them out? It depends on whether\
  \ or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which\
  \ sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries,\
  \ and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition\
  \ of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by\
  \ the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present\
  \ most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with\
  \ automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct\
  \ sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested\
  \ (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global\
  \ statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available\
  \ in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific\
  \ local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process\
  \ any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the\
  \ title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary\
  \ of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201Ckind of evergreen\
  \ tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201D and \u201Cwaste away through sorrow or\
  \ illness...\u201D And cone has three separate definitions: \u201Csolid body which\
  \ narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201Csomething of this shape w-hether\
  \ solid or hollow...,\u201D and \u201Cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201D\
  \ Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions:\
  \ thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the\
  \ likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"
