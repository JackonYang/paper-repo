paperAbstract: We investigate the task of 2D articulated human pose estimation in
  unconstrained still images. This is extremely challenging because of variation in
  pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models
  of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available
  training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models
  severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM)
  we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative
  classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce
  a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger
  than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement
  in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method.
