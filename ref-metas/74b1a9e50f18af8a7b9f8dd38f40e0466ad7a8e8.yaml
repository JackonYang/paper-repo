paperAbstract: This paper introduces Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs)
  for text classi cation. While regular Support Vector Machines (SVMs) try to induce
  a general decision function for a learning task, Transductive Support Vector Machines
  take into account a particular test set and try to minimize misclassi cations of
  just those particular examples. The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are
  well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments
  on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive
  methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training
  examples down to a twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes an algorithm
  for training TSVMs e ciently, handling 10,000 examples and more.
