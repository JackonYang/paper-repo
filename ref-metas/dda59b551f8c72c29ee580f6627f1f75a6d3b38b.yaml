paperAbstract: "1. Receptive fields of simple cells in area 17 of the cat were mapped\
  \ with stationary stimuli. Spatial frequency selectivities of the same cells were\
  \ measured with drifting sinusoidal gratings. 2. The reconstructed field profile\
  \ (inverse Fourier transform of selectivity curve) shows qualitative agreement with\
  \ the mapped profile, and suggests the existence of additional side\u2010lobes in\
  \ the field. The side\u2010lobes may correspond to the 'unresponsive regions' investigated\
  \ by Maffei & Fiorentini (1976). 3. Our data suggest that the simple cell may perform\
  \ approximately linear spatial summation of inputs to the visual system. However,\
  \ the output of the simple cell is generally non\u2010linear as reflected in its\
  \ truncated responses to gratings."
