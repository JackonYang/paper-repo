paperAbstract: "Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks\
  \ such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment,\
  \ and document classi\uFB01cation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant,\
  \ labeled data for learning these speci\uFB01c tasks is scarce, making it challenging\
  \ for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that\
  \ large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language\
  \ model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative \uFB01\
  ne-tuning on each speci\uFB01c task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make\
  \ use of task-aware input transformations during \uFB01ne-tuning to achieve effective\
  \ transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate\
  \ the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language\
  \ understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained\
  \ models that use architectures speci\uFB01cally crafted for each task, signi\uFB01\
  cantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For\
  \ instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories\
  \ Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment\
  \ (MultiNLI)."
