paperAbstract: We propose a learning algorithm for a variable memory length Markov
  process. Human communication, whether given as text, handwriting, or speech, has
  multi characteristic time scales. On short scales it is characterized mostly by
  the dynamics that generate the process, whereas on large scales, more syntactic
  and semantic information is carried. For that reason the conventionally used fixed
  memory Markov models cannot capture effectively the complexity of such structures.
  On the other hand using long memory models uniformly is not practical even for as
  short memory as four. The algorithm we propose is based on minimizing the statistical
  prediction error by extending the memory, or state length, adaptively, until the
  total prediction error is sufficiently small. We demonstrate the algorithm by learning
  the structure of natural English text and applying the learned model to the correction
  of corrupted text. Using less than 3000 states the model's performance is far superior
  to that of fixed memory models with similar number of states. We also show how the
  algorithm can be applied to intergenic E. coli DNA base prediction with results
  comparable to HMM based methods.
