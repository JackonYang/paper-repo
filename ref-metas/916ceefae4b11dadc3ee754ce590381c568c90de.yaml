paperAbstract: A learning algorithm for multilayer feedforward networks, RPROP (resilient
  propagation), is proposed. To overcome the inherent disadvantages of pure gradient-descent,
  RPROP performs a local adaptation of the weight-updates according to the behavior
  of the error function. Contrary to other adaptive techniques, the effect of the
  RPROP adaptation process is not blurred by the unforeseeable influence of the size
  of the derivative, but only dependent on the temporal behavior of its sign. This
  leads to an efficient and transparent adaptation process. The capabilities of RPROP
  are shown in comparison to other adaptive techniques.<<ETX>>
