paperAbstract: "Maximum-likelihood (ML) learning of Markov random fields is challenging\
  \ because it requires estimates of averages that have an exponential number of terms.\
  \ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods typically take a long time to converge on unbiased\
  \ estimates, but Hinton (2002) showed that if the Markov chain is only run for a\
  \ few steps, the learning can still work well and it approximately minimizes a different\
  \ function called \u201Ccontrastive divergence\u201D (CD). CD learning has been\
  \ successfully applied to various types of random fields. Here, we study the properties\
  \ of CD learning and show that it provides biased estimates in general, but that\
  \ the bias is typically very small. Fast CD learning can therefore be used to get\
  \ close to an ML solution and slow ML learning can then be used to fine-tune the\
  \ CD solution. Consider a probability distribution over a vector x (assumed discrete\
  \ w.l.o.g.) and with parameters W p(x;W) = 1 Z(W) e (1) where Z(W) = \u2211 x e\
  \ \u2212E(x;W) is a normalisation constant and E(x;W) is an energy function. This\
  \ class of random-field distributions has found many practical applications (Li,\
  \ 2001; Winkler, 2002; Teh et al., 2003; He et al., 2004). Maximum-likelihood (ML)\
  \ learning of the parameters W given an iid sample X = {xn}n=1 can be done by gradient\
  \ ascent: W = W + \u03B7 \u2202L(W;X ) \u2202W \u2223"
