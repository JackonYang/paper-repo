paperAbstract: Off-line handwriting recognition has wider applications than on-line
  recognition, yet it seems to be a harder problem. While on-line recognition is based
  on pen trajectory data, off-line recognition has to rely on pixel data only. We
  present a comparison between an off-line and an on-line recognition system using
  the same databases and system design. Both systems use a sliding window technique
  which avoids any segmentation before recognition. The recognizer is a hybrid system
  containing a neural network and a hidden Markov model. New normalization and feature
  extraction techniques for the off-line recognition are presented, including a connectionist
  approach for non-linear core height estimation. Results for uppercase, cursive and
  mixed case word recognition are reported. Finally a system combining the on- and
  off-line recognition is presented.
