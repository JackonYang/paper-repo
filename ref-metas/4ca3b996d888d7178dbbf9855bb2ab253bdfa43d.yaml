paperAbstract: 'Although the latest high-end smartphone has powerful CPU and GPU,
  running deeper convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for complex tasks such as ImageNet
  classification on mobile devices is challenging. To deploy deep CNNs on mobile devices,
  we present a simple and effective scheme to compress the entire CNN, which we call
  one-shot whole network compression. The proposed scheme consists of three steps:
  (1) rank selection with variational Bayesian matrix factorization, (2) Tucker decomposition
  on kernel tensor, and (3) fine-tuning to recover accumulated loss of accuracy, and
  each step can be easily implemented using publicly available tools. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by testing the performance of various compressed
  CNNs (AlexNet, VGGS, GoogLeNet, and VGG-16) on the smartphone. Significant reductions
  in model size, runtime, and energy consumption are obtained, at the cost of small
  loss in accuracy. In addition, we address the important implementation level issue
  on 1?1 convolution, which is a key operation of inception module of GoogLeNet as
  well as CNNs compressed by our proposed scheme.'
