paperAbstract: 'If we take an existing supervised NLP system, a simple and general
  way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word representations as extra word
  features. We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and
  HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use
  near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word
  representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements
  by combining different word representations. You can download our word features,
  for off-the-shelf use in existing NLP systems, as well as our code, here: http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/'
