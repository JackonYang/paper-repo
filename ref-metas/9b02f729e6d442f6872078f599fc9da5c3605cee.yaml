paperAbstract: Results of the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Competition are presented.
  A new Challenge 4 on Incidental Scene Text has been added to the Challenges on Born-Digital
  Images, Focused Scene Images and Video Text. Challenge 4 is run on a newly acquired
  dataset of 1,670 images evaluating Text Localisation, Word Recognition and End-to-End
  pipelines. In addition, the dataset for Challenge 3 on Video Text has been substantially
  updated with more video sequences and more accurate ground truth data. Finally,
  tasks assessing End-to-End system performance have been introduced to all Challenges.
  The competition took place in the first quarter of 2015, and received a total of
  44 submissions. Only the tasks newly introduced in 2015 are reported on. The datasets,
  the ground truth specification and the evaluation protocols are presented together
  with the results and a brief summary of the participating methods.
