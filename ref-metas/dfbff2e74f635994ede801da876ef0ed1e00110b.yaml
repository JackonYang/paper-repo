paperAbstract: One way of tackling document analysis is to split the document into
  different layers and then to find a segmentation for each one. The straight line
  is often one of the basic elements of the layers making up a document. The detection
  of these segments is often disturbed by the superposition of different layers in
  the same area. Therefore we developed a segment extractor, which processes masked
  areas, discontinuities and even curvatures. After showing in our previous work,
  the interest of such a system in binary image analysis, our aim was to show the
  method could be generalized to grey level images, by taking into account pixel luminosity
  as one of the parameters. The Kalman filter method combined with an adequate control
  scheme, allows the pooling of local observations, when their position, width and
  luminosity are coherent. The proposed model gives an interesting scheme to manage
  drawings masking each other (eg. cross-lines).
