paperAbstract: "Single cell recordings in monkey striate cortex have shown differences\
  \ in response properties from one cell layer to the next and have also shown that\
  \ the IVth layer, which receives most of its input from the geniculate, is subdivided\
  \ into a mosaic of regions, some connected to the left eye, others to the right.\
  \ In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers\
  \ in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with\
  \ a Fink\u2010Heimer modification of the Nauta method. We hoped to correlate the\
  \ laminar distribution of axon terminals in the cortex with functional differences\
  \ between layers, and to demonstrate the IVth\u2010layer mosaic anatomically."
