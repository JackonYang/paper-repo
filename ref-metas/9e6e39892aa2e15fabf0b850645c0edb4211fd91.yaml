paperAbstract: This paper presents an item searching method which has been applied
  to various kinds of forms. This approach is based on line detection through the
  Hough transform. After obtaining the straight lines, Hough directions are used to
  detect the real segments in the image. Segments can correspond either to continuous
  line, or to black parts of dashed or dotted lines. So, the segments are grouped
  together and classified between both adjacent line crossing points. Items are located
  by searching the minimum cycles of the graph constructed from the line intersection
  points. The last step consists of verifying the line classes based on the homogeneity
  hypothesis of item sides.
