paperAbstract: Detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing
  to the motion of the subjects, the camera and the background and to variations in
  pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and background clutter. We develop a detector
  for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds,
  testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated
  histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. These
  motion-based descriptors are combined with our Histogram of Oriented Gradient appearance
  descriptors. The resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging
  test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and
  background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. We validate our
  results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. The
  combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the
  best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000
  windows tested at 8% miss rate on our Test Set 1.
