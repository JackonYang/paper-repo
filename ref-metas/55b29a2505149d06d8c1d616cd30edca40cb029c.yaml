paperAbstract: We address the classic problems of detection, segmentation and pose
  estimation of people in images with a novel definition of a part, a poselet. We
  postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image
  (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned
  on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D,
  of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using
  anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure
  for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space
  as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond
  to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others.
  Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then
  be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet
  detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one
  can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits
  detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc.
  Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people
  detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making
  publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use
  by other researchers.
