paperAbstract: Adversarial training, which minimizes the maximal risk for label-preserving
  input perturbations, has proved to be effective for improving the generalization
  of language models. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial training algorithm
  - FreeLB, that promotes higher robustness and invariance in the embedding space,
  by adding adversarial perturbations to word embeddings and minimizing the resultant
  adversarial risk inside different regions around input samples. To validate the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply it to Transformer-based models
  for natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning tasks. Experiments
  on the GLUE benchmark show that when applied only to the finetuning stage, it is
  able to improve the overall test scores of BERT-based model from 78.3 to 79.4, and
  RoBERTa-large model from 88.5 to 88.8. In addition, the proposed approach achieves
  state-of-the-art test accuracies of 85.39\% and 67.32\% on ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge.
  Experiments on CommonsenseQA benchmark further demonstrate that FreeLB can be generalized
  and boost the performance of RoBERTa-large model on other tasks as well.
