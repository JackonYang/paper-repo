paperAbstract: "Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods\u2014\
  \ algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the\
  \ data\u2014there are several unresolved issues. First. there are a wide variety\
  \ of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many\
  \ of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable\
  \ clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that\
  \ can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation\
  \ theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected\
  \ to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of\
  \ challenging clustering problems."
