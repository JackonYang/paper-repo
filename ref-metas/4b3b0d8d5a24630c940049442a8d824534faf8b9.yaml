paperAbstract: 'This paper presents final results of ICDAR 2019 Scene Text Visual
  Question Answering competition (ST-VQA). ST-VQA introduces an important aspect that
  is not addressed by any Visual Question Answering system up to date, namely the
  incorporation of scene text to answer questions asked about an image. The competition
  introduces a new dataset comprising 23,038 images annotated with 31,791 question
  / answer pairs where the answer is always grounded on text instances present in
  the image. The images are taken from 7 different public computer vision datasets,
  covering a wide range of scenarios. The competition was structured in three tasks
  of increasing difficulty, that require reading the text in a scene and understanding
  it in the context of the scene, to correctly answer a given question. A novel evaluation
  metric is presented, which elegantly assesses both key capabilities expected from
  an optimal model: text recognition and image understanding. A detailed analysis
  of results from different participants is showcased, which provides insight into
  the current capabilities of VQA systems that can read. We firmly believe the dataset
  proposed in this challenge will be an important milestone to consider towards a
  path of more robust and general models that can exploit scene text to achieve holistic
  image understanding.'
