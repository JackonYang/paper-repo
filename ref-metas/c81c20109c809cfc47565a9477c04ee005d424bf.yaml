paperAbstract: Most state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class image segmentation
  and labeling use conditional random fields defined over pixels or image regions.
  While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level
  models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures.
  In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set
  of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional
  inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate
  inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials
  are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate
  that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and
  labeling accuracy.
