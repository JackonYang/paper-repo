paperAbstract: We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes
  and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of similarity
  is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes,
  (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve
  the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point.
  The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining
  points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization.
  Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling
  us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point
  correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes;
  regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for
  this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching
  errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude
  of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification
  framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits
  and the COIL dataset.
