paperAbstract: 'We have developed a generalized alphanumeric character extraction
  algorithm that can efficiently and accurately locate and extract characters from
  complex scene images. A scene image may be complex due to the following reasons:
  (1) the characters are embedded in an image with other objects, such as structural
  bars, company logos and smears; (2) the characters may be painted or printed in
  any color including white, and the background color may differ only slightly from
  that of the characters; (3) the font, size and format of the characters may be different;
  and (4) the lighting may be uneven. The main contribution of this research is that
  it permits the quick and accurate extraction of characters in a complex scene. A
  coarse search technique is used to locate potential characters, and then a fine
  grouping technique is used to extract characters accurately. Several additional
  techniques in the postprocessing phase eliminate spurious as well as overlapping
  characters. Experimental results of segmenting characters written on cargo container
  surfaces show that the system is feasible under real-life constraints. The program
  has been installed as part of a vision system which verifies container codes on
  vehicles passing through the Port of Singapore.'
