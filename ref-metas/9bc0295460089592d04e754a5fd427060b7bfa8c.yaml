paperAbstract: 'We study the problem of object recognition for categories for which
  we have no training examples, a task also called zero--data or zero-shot learning.
  This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though
  it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes,
  and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of
  them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects
  are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic
  attributes, such as the object''s color or shape. Because the identification of
  each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute
  classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data
  sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based
  on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In
  this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000
  images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments
  on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is
  able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes.'
