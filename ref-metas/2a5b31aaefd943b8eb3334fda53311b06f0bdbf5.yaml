paperAbstract: A large number of algorithms have been proposed for feature subset
  selection. Our experimental results show that the sequential forward floating selection
  algorithm, proposed by Pudil et al. (1994), dominates the other algorithms tested.
  We study the problem of choosing an optimal feature set for land use classification
  based on SAR satellite images using four different texture models. Pooling features
  derived from different texture models, followed by a feature selection results in
  a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy. We also illustrate the
  dangers of using feature selection in small sample size situations.
