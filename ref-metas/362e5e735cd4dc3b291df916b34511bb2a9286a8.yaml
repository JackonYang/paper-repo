paperAbstract: "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual\
  \ cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the\
  \ incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that\
  \ most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments,\
  \ and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells.\
  \ The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer\
  \ IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields\
  \ with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or\
  \ from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below\
  \ IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In\
  \ a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions\
  \ in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more\
  \ effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance\
  \ are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the\
  \ cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together\
  \ in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all\
  \ cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods\
  \ it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating\
  \ left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes\
  \ about 400 \u03BCm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells\
  \ of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be\
  \ similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked\
  \ in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally\
  \ encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise;\
  \ a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through\
  \ 180\xB0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally\
  \ by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right\
  \ eye or a complete 180\xB0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence\
  \ hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the\
  \ cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well\
  \ known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped\
  \ in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal\
  \ to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate\
  \ receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is\
  \ seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding\
  \ to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm,\
  \ traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual\
  \ field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2\
  \ mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate\
  \ receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field\
  \ is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction\
  \ in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area\
  \ of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of\
  \ visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically\
  \ but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn\
  \ monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically\
  \ programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at\
  \ birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout\
  \ its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6\
  \ weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured\
  \ closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken\
  \ and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least\
  \ in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and\
  \ retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."
