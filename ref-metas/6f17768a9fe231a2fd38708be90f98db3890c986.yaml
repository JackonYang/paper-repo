paperAbstract: This paper shows how a text classiier's need for labeled training data
  can be reduced by a combination of active learning and Expectation Maximization
  (EM) on a pool of unlabeled data. Query-by-Committee is used to actively select
  documents for labeling, then EM with a naive Bayes model further improves classiication
  accuracy by concurrently estimating probabilistic labels for the remaining unlabeled
  documents and using them to improve the model. We also present a metric for better
  measuring disagreement among committee members; it accounts for the strength of
  their disagreement and for the distribution of the documents. Experimental results
  show that our method of combining EM and active learning requires only half as many
  labeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either EM or active learning
  alone.
