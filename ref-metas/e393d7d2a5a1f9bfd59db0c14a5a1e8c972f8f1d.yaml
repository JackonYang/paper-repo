paperAbstract: This paper describes a method for extracting words, textlines and text
  blocks by analyzing the spatial configuration of bounding boxes of connected component
  on a given document image. The basic idea is that connected components of black
  pixels can be used as computational units in document image analysis. In this paper,
  the problem of extracting words, textlines and text blocks is viewed as a clustering
  problem in the 2-dimensional discrete domain. Our main strategy is that profiling
  analysis is utilized to measure horizontal or vertical gaps of (groups of) components
  during the process of image segmentation. For this purpose, we compute the smallest
  rectangular box, called the bounding box, which circumscribes a connected component.
  Those boxes are projected horizontally and/or vertically, and local and global projection
  profiles are analyzed for word, textline and text-block segmentation. In the last
  step of segmentation, the document decomposition hierarchy is produced from these
  segmented objects.
