paperAbstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of automatic caption generation
  for news images. Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available
  on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned. Inspired by recent work
  in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models.
  They both operate over the output of a probabilistic image annotation model that
  pre-processes the pictures and suggests keywords to describe their content. Experimental
  results show that an abstractive model defined over phrases is superior to extractive
  methods.
