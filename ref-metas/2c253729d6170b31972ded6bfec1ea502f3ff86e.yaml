paperAbstract: Image auto-annotation, i.e., the association of words to whole images,
  has attracted considerable attention. In particular, unsupervised, probabilistic
  latent variable models of text and image features have shown encouraging results,
  but their performance with respect to other approaches remains unknown. In this
  paper, we apply and compare two simple latent space models commonly used in text
  analysis, namely Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Probabilistic LSA (PLSA). Annotation
  strategies for each model are discussed. Remarkably, we found that, on a 8000-image
  dataset, a classic LSA model defined on keywords and a very basic image representation
  performed as well as much more complex, state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, non-probabilistic
  methods (LSA and direct image matching) outperformed PLSA on the same dataset.
