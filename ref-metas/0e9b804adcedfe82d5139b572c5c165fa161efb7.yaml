paperAbstract: Two neural mechanisms are described which exhibit recognition of forms.
  Both are independent of small perturbations at synapses of excitation, threshold,
  and synchrony, and are referred to partiular appropriate regions of the nervous
  system, thus suggesting experimental verification. The first mechanism averages
  an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested
  that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition
  to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former
  mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes
  regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism
  translating apparitions to the fovea. Both are extensions to contemporaneous functions
  of the knowing of universals heretofore treated by the authors only with respect
  to sequence in time.
