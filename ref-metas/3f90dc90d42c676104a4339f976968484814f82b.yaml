paperAbstract: We present a novel multi-person pose estimation framework, which extends
  pictorial structures (PS) to explicitly model interactions between people and to
  estimate their poses jointly. Interactions are modeled as occlusions between people.
  First, we propose an occlusion probability predictor, based on the location of persons
  automatically detected in the image, and incorporate the predictions as occlusion
  priors into our multi-person PS model. Moreover, our model includes an inter-people
  exclusion penalty, preventing body parts from different people from occupying the
  same image region. Thanks to these elements, our model has a global view of the
  scene, resulting in better pose estimates in group photos, where several persons
  stand nearby and occlude each other. In a comprehensive evaluation on a new, challenging
  group photo datasets we demonstrate the benefits of our multi-person model over
  a state-of-the-art single-person pose estimator which treats each person independently.
