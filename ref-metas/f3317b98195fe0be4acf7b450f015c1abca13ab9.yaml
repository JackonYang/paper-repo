paperAbstract: "Object and pattern detection is a classical computer vision problem\
  \ with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to\
  \ image-based industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines. While there have been\
  \ some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems\
  \ handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described\
  \ by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. \nThis thesis presents a learning\
  \ based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image\
  \ appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object\
  \ and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features\
  \ like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain\
  \ tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character,\
  \ which may be written or printed in many different styles. \nThe thesis consists\
  \ of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach\
  \ using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based\
  \ model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe\
  \ the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity\
  \ measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model.\
  \ We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example\
  \ generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the\
  \ target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target\
  \ class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by\
  \ demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems.\
  \ \nBecause our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based,\
  \ how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training\
  \ examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select\
  \ high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning\
  \ is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select\
  \ future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We\
  \ propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for\
  \ three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection\
  \ strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally,\
  \ we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to\
  \ a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern\
  \ detection problems. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, Rm. 14-0551,\
