paperAbstract: Before the step for text recognition, a text image needs to be segmented
  into foreground containing only the text area and background. In this paper, a method
  is proposed for segmenting colour natural scene texts which suffer from a wide range
  of degradations with complex background. A text image is firstly processed by two
  3-means clustering operations with different distance measurements. Then, a modified
  connected component (CC)-based validation method is used to obtain the text area
  after clustering. Thirdly, a proposed objective segmentation evaluation method is
  utilised to choose the final segmentation result from the two segmented text images.
  The proposed method is compared with other existing methods based on the ICDAR2003
  public database. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
