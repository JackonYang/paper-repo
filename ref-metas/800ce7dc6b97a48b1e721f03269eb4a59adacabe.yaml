paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel technique for automatic table detection
  in document images. Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual
  entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance
  as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection
  that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and
  vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed
  method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers
  a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals,
  tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents.'
