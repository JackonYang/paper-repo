paperAbstract: Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine
  translation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results compared
  to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation.
  Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling
  a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase
  proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method
  based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary
  without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently
  done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only
  a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed
  approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary
  as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we
  use the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we achieve
  the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the English!German
  translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art English!French translation
  system.
