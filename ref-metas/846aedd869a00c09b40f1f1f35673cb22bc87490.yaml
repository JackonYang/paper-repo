paperAbstract: "The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic\
  \ games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty\
  \ of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer\
  \ Go that uses \u2018value networks\u2019 to evaluate board positions and \u2018\
  policy networks\u2019 to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by\
  \ a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement\
  \ learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks\
  \ play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that\
  \ simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search\
  \ algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.\
  \ Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate\
  \ against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games\
  \ to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional\
  \ player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least\
  \ a decade away."
