paperAbstract: Graphical techniques for modeling the dependencies of random variables
  have been explored in a variety of different areas, including statistics, statistical
  physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image processing, and genetics.
  Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively independently
  in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs)
  and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence
  networks (PINs). The paper presents a self-contained review of the basic principles
  of PINs. It is shown that the well-known forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms
  for HMMs are special cases of more general inference algorithms for arbitrary PINs.
  Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for more general
  graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish
  to explore a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models
  to handle sensor fusion and coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced
  and treated within the graphical model framework to illustrate the advantages of
  the general approach.
