paperAbstract: "Classification \u2022 Supervised \u2013 parallelpiped \u2013 minimum\
  \ distance \u2013 maximum likelihood (Bayes Rule) > non-parametric > parametric\
  \ \u2013 support vector machines \u2013 neural networks \u2013 context classification\
  \ \u2022 Unsupervised (clustering) \u2013 K-Means \u2013 ISODATA \u2022 Pattern\
  \ recognition in remote sensing has been based on the intuitive notion that pixels\
  \ belonging to the same class should have similar gray values in a given band. \u2013\
  \ Given two spectral bands, pixels from the same class plotted in a two-dimensional\
  \ histogram should appear as a localized cluster. \u2013 If n images, each in a\
  \ different spectral band, are available, pixels from the same class should form\
  \ a localized cluster in n-space."
