paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a new method for detecting scale invariant interest
  points. The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points
  can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2)
  Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic
  local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the
  Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the
  Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points
  for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale,
  rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes
  of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant
  points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant
  descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine
  illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental
  results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for
  a database with more than 5000 images.'
