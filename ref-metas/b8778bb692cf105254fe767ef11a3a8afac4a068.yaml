paperAbstract: Artificial neural net models have been studied for many years in the
  hope of achieving human-like performance in the fields of speech and image recognition.
  These models are composed of many nonlinear computational elements operating in
  parallel and arranged in patterns reminiscent of biological neural nets. Computational
  elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use
  to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial
  neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation
  techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance
  speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of
  artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be
  used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks
  that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct
  more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is
  placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can
  be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement
  algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error
  classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision
  regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward
  manner by three-layer feed-forward nets.
