paperAbstract: We describe a tracker that can track moving people in long sequences
  without manual initialization. Moving people are modeled with the assumption that,
  while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance
  does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance
  of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses
  this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not
  rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such
  models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are
  common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure
  on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that
  this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c)
  recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly
  leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and
  (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion.
