paperAbstract: Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) offers a new approach to the theory
  of natural language grammar. Coordination, relativization, and related prosodic
  phenomena have been analyzed in CCG in terms of a radically revised notion of surface
  structure. CCG surface structures do not exhibit traditional notions of syntactic
  dominance and command, and do not constitute an autonomous level of representation.
  Instead, they reflect the computations by which a sentence may be realized or analyzed,
  to synchronously define a predicate-argument structure, or logical form. Surface
  Structure and Interpretation shows that binding and control can be captured at this
  level, preserving the advantages of CCG as an account of coordination and unbounded
  dependency.The core of the book is a detailed treatment of extraction, a focus of
  syntactic research since the early work of Chomsky and Ross. The topics addressed
  include the sources of subject-object asymmetries and phenomena attributed to the
  Empty Category Principle (ECP), asymmetric islands, parasitic gaps, and the relation
  of coordination and extraction, including their interactions with binding theory.
  In his conclusion, the author relates CCG to other categorial and type-driven approaches
  and to proposals for minimalism in linguistic theory.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph
