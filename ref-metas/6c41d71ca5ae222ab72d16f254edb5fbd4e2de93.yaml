paperAbstract: 'Recent advances in intelligent character recognition are enabling
  us to address many challenging problems in document image analysis. One of them
  is intelligent form analysis. This paper describes a generic system for form dropout
  when the filled-in characters or symbols are either touching or crossing the form
  frames. We propose a method to separate these characters from form frames whose
  locations are unknown. Since some of the character strokes are either touching or
  crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: 1) localization
  of form frames; 2) separation of characters and form frames; and 3) reconstruction
  of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically
  located by finding long straight lines based on the block adjacency graph. Form
  frame separation and character reconstruction are implemented by means of this graph.
  The proposed system includes form structure learning and form dropout. First, a
  form structure-based template is automatically generated from a blank form which
  includes form frames, preprinted data areas and skew angle. With this form template,
  our system can then extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental
  results on three different types of forms show the performance of our system. Further,
  the proposed method is robust to noise and skew that is introduced during scanning.'
