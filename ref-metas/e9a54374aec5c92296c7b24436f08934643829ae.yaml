paperAbstract: We develop a refined mean field approximation for inference and learning
  in probabilistic neural networks. Our mean field theory, unlike most, does not assume
  that the units behave as independent degrees of freedom; instead, it exploits in
  a principled way the existence of large substructures that are computationally tractable.
  To illustrate the advantages of this framework, we show how to incorporate weak
  higher order interactions into a first-order hidden Markov model, treating the corrections
  (but not the first order structure) within mean field theory.
