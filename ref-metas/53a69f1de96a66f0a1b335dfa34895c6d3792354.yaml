paperAbstract: Today, PDF is one of the most popular document formats in the web.
  Many PDF documents are not images, but remain untagged. They have no tags for identifying
  the logical reading order, paragraphs, figures, and tables. One of the challenges
  with these documents is how to extract tables from them. The paper discusses a new
  system for table structure recognition in untagged PDF documents. It is formulated
  as a set of configurable parameters and ad-hoc heuristics for recovering table cells.
  We consider two different configurations for the system and demonstrate experimental
  results based on the existing competition dataset for both of them.
