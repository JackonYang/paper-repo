paperAbstract: We present a framework for designing incremental learning algorithms
  derived from generalized entropy functionals. Our approach is based on the use of
  Bregman divergences together with the associated class of additive models constructed
  using the Legendre transform. A particular one-parameter family of Bregman divergences
  is shown to yield a family of loss functions that includes the log-likelihood criterion
  of logistic regression as a special case, and that closely approximates the exponential
  loss criterion used in the AdaBoost algorithms of Schapire et a/., as the natural
  parameter of the family varies. We also show how the quadratic approximation of
  the gain in Bregman divergence results in a weighted least-squares criterion. This
  leads to a family of incremental learning algorithms that builds upon and extends
  the recent interpretation of boosting in terms of additive models proposed by Friedman,
  Hastie, and Tibshirani.
