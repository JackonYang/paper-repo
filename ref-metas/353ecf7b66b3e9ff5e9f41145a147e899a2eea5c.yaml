paperAbstract: Generative Adversarial Nets [8] were recently introduced as a novel
  way to train generative models. In this work we introduce the conditional version
  of generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the data,
  y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. We show that
  this model can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels. We also illustrate
  how this model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and provide preliminary
  examples of an application to image tagging in which we demonstrate how this approach
  can generate descriptive tags which are not part of training labels.
