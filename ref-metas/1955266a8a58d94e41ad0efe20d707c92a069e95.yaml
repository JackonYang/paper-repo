paperAbstract: We present two algorithms for the approximate nearest neighbor problem
  in high-dimensional spaces. For data sets of size n living in R d , the algorithms
  require space that is only polynomial in n and d, while achieving query times that
  are sub-linear in n and polynomial in d. We also show applications to other high-dimensional
  geometric problems, such as the approximate minimum spanning tree. The article is
  based on the material from the authors' STOC'98 and FOCS'01 papers. It unifies,
  generalizes and simplifies the results from those papers.
