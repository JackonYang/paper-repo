paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel texture representation suitabl e for recognizing
  images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint
  changes and non-rigid deformations. Unlike many existing feature extraction methods,
  which treat the neighborhood of every pixel as a candidate texture element, the
  proposed algorithm works by selecting a sparse set of affine-invariant local patches.
  This spatial selection process, besides provi ding greater computational efficiency
  and reducing redundancy in texton dictionaries, permits the computation of characteristic
  scale and neighborhood shape for every texture element. Shape information is used
  to determine the right support region for computing intensity-based descri ptors.
  When affine invariance is not required, shape can itsel f become a discriminative
  feature. The proposed texture representation is evaluated in retrieval and classification
  tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a collection of photographs of textured
  surfaces featuring viewpoint changes and non-rigid deformations, as well as variations
  in illumination and appearance .
