paperAbstract: One of the most important issues in machine learning is whether one
  can improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by including unlabeled
  data. Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to
  as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at
  the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness.
  This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach
  to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures
  on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power)
  from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural
  learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to
  learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning
  will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will
  be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised
  learning setting.
