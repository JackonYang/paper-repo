paperAbstract: We introduce a simple and effective method for regularizing large convolutional
  neural networks. We replace the conventional deterministic pooling operations with
  a stochastic procedure, randomly picking the activation within each pooling region
  according to a multinomial distribution, given by the activities within the pooling
  region. The approach is hyper-parameter free and can be combined with other regularization
  approaches, such as dropout and data augmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
  on four image datasets, relative to other approaches that do not utilize data augmentation.
