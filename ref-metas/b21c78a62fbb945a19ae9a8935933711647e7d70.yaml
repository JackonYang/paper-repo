paperAbstract: 'Natural language generation of coherent long texts like paragraphs
  or longer documents is a challenging problem for recurrent networks models. In this
  paper, we explore an important step toward this generation task: training an LSTM
  (Longshort term memory) auto-encoder to preserve and reconstruct multi-sentence
  paragraphs. We introduce an LSTM model that hierarchically builds an embedding for
  a paragraph from embeddings for sentences and words, then decodes this embedding
  to reconstruct the original paragraph. We evaluate the reconstructed paragraph using
  standard metrics like ROUGE and Entity Grid, showing that neural models are able
  to encode texts in a way that preserve syntactic, semantic, and discourse coherence.
  While only a first step toward generating coherent text units from neural models,
  our work has the potential to significantly impact natural language generation and
  summarization1.'
