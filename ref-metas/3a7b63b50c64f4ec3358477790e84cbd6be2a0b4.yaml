paperAbstract: Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context
  paragraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the query.
  Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically
  these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the context and summarize
  it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions temporally, and/or often form a uni-directional
  attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF)
  network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different
  levels of granularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain
  a query-aware context representation without early summarization. Our experimental
  evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford
  Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze test.
