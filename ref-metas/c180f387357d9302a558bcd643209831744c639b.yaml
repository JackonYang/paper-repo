paperAbstract: This paper briefly describes the major features of the DRAGON speech
  understanding system. DRAGON makes systematic use of a general abstract model to
  represent each of the knowledge sources necessary for automatic recognition of continuous
  speech. The model--that of a probabilistic function of a Markov process--is very
  flexible and leads to features which allow DRAGON to function despite high error
  rates from individual knowledge sources. Repeated use of a simple abstract model
  produces a system which is simple in structure, but powerful in capabilities.
