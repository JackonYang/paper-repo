paperAbstract: "The paper contributes to the viewpoint invariant recognition of planar\
  \ patterns, especially labels and signs under affine deformations. By their nature,\
  \ the information of such \u2018eye-catchers\u2019 is not contained in the outline\
  \ or frame \u2014 they often are affinely equivalent like parallelograms and ellipses\
  \ \u2014 but in the intensity content within. Moment invariants are well suited\
  \ for their recognition. They need a closed bounding contour, but this is comparatively\
  \ easy to provide for the simple shapes considered. On the other hand, they characterize\
  \ the intensity patterns without the need for error prone feature extraction. This\
  \ paper uses moments as the basic features, but extends the literature in two respects:\
  \ (1) deliberate mixes of different types of moments to keep the order of the moments\
  \ (and hence also the sensitivity to noise) low and yet have a sufficiently large\
  \ number to safeguard discriminant power; and (2) invariance with respect to photometric\
  \ changes is incorporated in order to find the simplest moment invariants that can\
  \ cope with changing lighting conditions which can hardly be avoided when changing\
  \ viewpoint. The paper gives complete classifications of such affine / photometric\
  \ moment invariants. Experiments are described that illustrate the use of some of\
  \ them."
