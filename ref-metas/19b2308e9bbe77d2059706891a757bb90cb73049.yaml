paperAbstract: It is argued that it is time for a major change of approach to optical
  character recognition (OCR) research. The traditional approach, focusing on the
  correct classification of isolated characters, has been exhausted. The demonstration
  of the superiority of a new classification method under operational conditions requires
  large experimental facilities and databases beyond the resources of most researchers.
  In any case, even perfect classification of individual characters is insufficient
  for the conversion of complex archival documents to a useful computer-readable form.
  Many practical OCR tasks require integrated treatment of entire documents and well-organized
  typographic and domain-specific knowledge. New OCR systems should take advantage
  of the typographic uniformity of paragraphs or other layout components. They should
  also exploit the unavoidable interaction with human operators to improve themselves
  without explicit 'training'. >
