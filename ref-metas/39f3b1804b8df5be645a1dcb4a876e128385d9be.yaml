paperAbstract: 'The Fisher kernel (FK) is a generic framework which combines the benefits
  of generative and discriminative approaches. In the context of image classification
  the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond
  count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet
  shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several
  well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy
  of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9%
  to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A
  major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and
  costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore
  image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we
  compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet
  and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training
  images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well
  (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement
  classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets.'
