paperAbstract: 'We develop a new edge detection algorithm that addresses two important
  issues in this long-standing vision problem: (1) holistic image training and prediction;
  and (2) multi-scale and multi-level feature learning. Our proposed method, holistically-nested
  edge detection (HED), performs image-to-image prediction by means of a deep learning
  model that leverages fully convolutional neural networks and deeply-supervised nets.
  HED automatically learns rich hierarchical representations (guided by deep supervision
  on side responses) that are important in order to resolve the challenging ambiguity
  in edge and object boundary detection. We significantly advance the state-of-the-art
  on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score of 0.790) and the NYU Depth dataset (ODS F-score
  of 0.746), and do so with an improved speed (0.4 s per image) that is orders of
  magnitude faster than some CNN-based edge detection algorithms developed before
  HED. We also observe encouraging results on other boundary detection benchmark datasets
  such as Multicue and PASCAL-Context.'
