paperAbstract: A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables,
  which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n 41) vertices of a general
  simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another
  point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the
  final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact.
  A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood
  of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.
