paperAbstract: "In this paper, we present a systematic framework for recognizing realistic\
  \ actions from videos \u201Cin the wild\u201D. Such unconstrained videos are abundant\
  \ in personal collections as well as on the Web. Recognizing action from such videos\
  \ has not been addressed extensively, primarily due to the tremendous variations\
  \ that result from camera motion, background clutter, changes in object appearance,\
  \ and scale, etc. The main challenge is how to extract reliable and informative\
  \ features from the unconstrained videos. We extract both motion and static features\
  \ from the videos. Since the raw features of both types are dense yet noisy, we\
  \ propose strategies to prune these features. We use motion statistics to acquire\
  \ stable motion features and clean static features. Furthermore, PageRank is used\
  \ to mine the most informative static features. In order to further construct compact\
  \ yet discriminative visual vocabularies, a divisive information-theoretic algorithm\
  \ is employed to group semantically related features. Finally, AdaBoost is chosen\
  \ to integrate all the heterogeneous yet complementary features for recognition.\
  \ We have tested the framework on the KTH dataset and our own dataset consisting\
  \ of 11 categories of actions collected from YouTube and personal videos, and have\
  \ obtained impressive results for action recognition and action localization."
