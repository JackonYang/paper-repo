paperAbstract: We present a new formalism, probabilistic feature grammar (PFG). PFGs
  combine most of the best properties of several other formalisms, including those
  of Collins, Magerman, and Charniak, and in experiments have comparable or better
  performance. PFGs generate features one at a time, probabilistically, conditioning
  the probabilities of each feature on other features in a local context. Because
  the conditioning is local, efficient polynomial time parsing algorithms exist for
  computing inside, outside, and Viterbi parses. PFGs can produce probabilities of
  strings, making them potentially useful for language modeling. Precision and recall
  results are comparable to the state of the art with words, and the best reported
  without words.
