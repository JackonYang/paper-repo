paperAbstract: We have already shown that extracting long-term dependencies from sequential
  data is difficult, both for determimstic dynamical systems such as recurrent networks,
  and probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) or input/output hidden
  Markov models (IOHMMs). In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used
  domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables
  representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type
  of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically.
  This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long
  time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays
  and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures.
  A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs.
