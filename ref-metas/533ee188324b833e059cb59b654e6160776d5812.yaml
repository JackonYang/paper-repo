paperAbstract: In this paper, we explore different ways to extend a recurrent neural
  network (RNN) to a \textit{deep} RNN. We start by arguing that the concept of depth
  in an RNN is not as clear as it is in feedforward neural networks. By carefully
  analyzing and understanding the architecture of an RNN, however, we find three points
  of an RNN which may be made deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2) hidden-to-hidden
  transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. Based on this observation, we propose
  two novel architectures of a deep RNN which are orthogonal to an earlier attempt
  of stacking multiple recurrent layers to build a deep RNN (Schmidhuber, 1992; El
  Hihi and Bengio, 1996). We provide an alternative interpretation of these deep RNNs
  using a novel framework based on neural operators. The proposed deep RNNs are empirically
  evaluated on the tasks of polyphonic music prediction and language modeling. The
  experimental result supports our claim that the proposed deep RNNs benefit from
  the depth and outperform the conventional, shallow RNNs.
