paperAbstract: This paper investigates learning in a lifelong context. Lifelong learning
  addresses situations in which a learner faces a whole stream of learning tasks.
  Such scenarios provide the opportunity to transfer knowledge across multiple learning
  tasks, in order to generalize more accurately from less training data. In this paper,
  several different approaches to lifelong learning are described, and applied in
  an object recognition domain. It is shown that across the board, lifelong learning
  approaches generalize consistently more accurately from less training data, by their
  ability to transfer knowledge across learning tasks.
