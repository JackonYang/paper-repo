paperAbstract: Multilayer Neural Networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm
  constitute the best example of a successful Gradient-Based Learning technique. Given
  an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used
  to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns
  such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various
  methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard
  handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically
  designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all
  other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple
  modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling.
  A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module
  systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an
  overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are
  described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility
  of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check
  is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined
  with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal
  checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.
