paperAbstract: In automatic speech recognition, language models can be represented
  by Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). In this lecture we review some known
  algorithms which handle PCFGs; in particular an algorithm for the computation of
  the total probability that a PCFG generates a given sentence (Inside), an algorithm
  for finding the most probable parse tree (Viterbi), and an algorithm for the estimation
  of the probabilities of the rewriting rules of a PCFG given a corpus (Inside-Outside).
  Moreover, we introduce the Left-to-Right Inside algorithm, which computes the probability
  that successive applications of the grammar rewriting rules (beginning with the
  sentence start symbol s) produce a word string whose initial substring is a given
  one.
