paperAbstract: This paper presents a new approach for learning in structured domains
  (SDs) using a constructive neural network for graphs (NN4G). The new model allows
  the extension of the input domain for supervised neural networks to a general class
  of graphs including both acyclic/cyclic, directed/undirected labeled graphs. In
  particular, the model can realize adaptive contextual transductions, learning the
  mapping from graphs for both classification and regression tasks. In contrast to
  previous neural networks for structures that had a recursive dynamics, NN4G is based
  on a constructive feedforward architecture with state variables that uses neurons
  with no feedback connections. The neurons are applied to the input graphs by a general
  traversal process that relaxes the constraints of previous approaches derived by
  the causality assumption over hierarchical input data. Moreover, the incremental
  approach eliminates the need to introduce cyclic dependencies in the definition
  of the system state variables. In the traversal process, the NN4G units exploit
  (local) contextual information of the graphs vertices. In spite of the simplicity
  of the approach, we show that, through the compositionality of the contextual information
  developed by the learning, the model can deal with contextual information that is
  incrementally extended according to the graphs topology. The effectiveness and the
  generality of the new approach are investigated by analyzing its theoretical properties
  and providing experimental results.
