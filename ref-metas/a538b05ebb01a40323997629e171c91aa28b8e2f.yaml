paperAbstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines were developed using binary stochastic
  hidden units. These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite
  number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative
  biases. The learning and inference rules for these "Stepped Sigmoid Units" are unchanged.
  They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared
  with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition
  on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.
  Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative
  intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors.
