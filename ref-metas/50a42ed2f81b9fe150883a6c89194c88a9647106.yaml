paperAbstract: The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in
  time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis
  testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model
  identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed
  and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE)
  which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When
  there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum
  likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by
  AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters
  within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification
  which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis
  testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated
  with some numerical examples.
