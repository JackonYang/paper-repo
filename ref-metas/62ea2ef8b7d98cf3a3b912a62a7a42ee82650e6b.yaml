paperAbstract: A parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general context-free
  algorithm known is described. It is similar to both Knuth's LR(<italic>k</italic>)
  algorithm and the familiar top-down algorithm. It has a time bound proportional
  to <italic>n</italic><supscrpt>3</supscrpt> (where <italic>n</italic> is the length
  of the string being parsed) in general; it has an <italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt>
  bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars,
  which seems to include most practical context-free programming language grammars.
  In an empirical comparison it appears to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up
  algorithms studied by Griffiths and Petrick.
