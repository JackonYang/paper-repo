paperAbstract: Deep neural networks have recently become the gold standard for acoustic
  modeling in speech recognition systems. The key computational unit of a deep network
  is a linear projection followed by a point-wise non-linearity, which is typically
  a logistic function. In this work, we show that we can improve generalization and
  make training of deep networks faster and simpler by substituting the logistic units
  with rectified linear units. These units are linear when their input is positive
  and zero otherwise. In a supervised setting, we can successfully train very deep
  nets from random initialization on a large vocabulary speech recognition task achieving
  lower word error rates than using a logistic network with the same topology. Similarly
  in an unsupervised setting, we show how we can learn sparse features that can be
  useful for discriminative tasks. All our experiments are executed in a distributed
  environment using several hundred machines and several hundred hours of speech data.
