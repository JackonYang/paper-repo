paperAbstract: "Interneurons exhibiting centre-surround antagonism within their receptive\
  \ fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this\
  \ organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that\
  \ minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial\
  \ correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes\
  \ a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical\
  \ prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from\
  \ the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by\
  \ the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted\
  \ to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable\
  \ against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive\
  \ encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of\
  \ interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into\
  \ account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required\
  \ inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends\
  \ strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial\
  \ correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory\
  \ resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround\
  \ should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property\
  \ is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019\
  s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic\
  \ responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages\
  \ of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual\
  \ image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing\
  \ the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that\
  \ a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and\
  \ the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally,\
  \ the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression\
  \ hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis\
  \ (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff\
  \ 1965)."
