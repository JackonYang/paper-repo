paperAbstract: 'In this work we show how to combine bottom-up and top-down approaches
  into a single figure-ground segmentation process. This process provides accurate
  delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down
  or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned
  from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation
  to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria
  to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either
  the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation
  that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as
  possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up
  process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a
  global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements.
  We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by
  applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map
  that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up
  information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the
  results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down
  or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined
  use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations.'
