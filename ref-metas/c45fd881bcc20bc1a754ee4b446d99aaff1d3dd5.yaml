paperAbstract: "This paper introduces Logical Semantics with Perception (LSP), a model\
  \ for grounded language acquisition that learns to map natural language statements\
  \ to their referents in a physical environment. For example, given an image, LSP\
  \ can map the statement \u201Cblue mug on the table\u201D to the set of image segments\
  \ showing blue mugs on tables. LSP learns physical representations for both categorical\
  \ (\u201Cblue,\u201D \u201Cmug\u201D) and relational (\u201Con\u201D) language,\
  \ and also learns to compose these representations to produce the referents of entire\
  \ statements. We further introduce a weakly supervised training procedure that estimates\
  \ LSP\u2019s parameters using annotated referents for entire statements, without\
  \ annotated referents for individual words or the parse structure of the statement.\
  \ We perform experiments on two applications: scene understanding and geographical\
  \ question answering. We find that LSP outperforms existing, less expressive models\
  \ that cannot represent relational language. We further find that weakly supervised\
  \ training is competitive with fully supervised training while requiring significantly\
  \ less annotation effort."
