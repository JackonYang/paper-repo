paperAbstract: The effects of adding information from relevant documents are examined
  in the TREC routing environment. A modified Rocchio relevance feedback approach
  is used, with a varying number of relevant documents retrieved by an initial SMART
  search, and a varying number of terms from those relevant documents used to expand
  the initial query. Recall-precision evaluation reveals that as the amount of expansion
  of the query due to adding terms from relevant documents increases, so does the
  effectiveness. There appears to be a linear relationship between the log of the
  number of terms added and the recall-precision effectiveness. There also appears
  to be a linear relationship between the log of the number of known relevant documents
  and the recall-precision effectiveness.
