paperAbstract: We present a new framework for interpreting face images and image sequences
  using an Active Appearance Model (AAM). The AAM contains a statistical, photo-realistic
  model of the shape and grey-level appearance of faces. This paper demonstrates the
  use of the AAM's efficient iterative matching scheme for image interpretation. We
  use the AAM as a basis for face recognition, obtain good results for difficult images.
  We show how the AAM framework allows identity information to be decoupled from other
  variation, allowing evidence of identity to be integrated over a sequence. The AAM
  approach makes optimal use of the evidence from either a single image or image sequence.
  Since we derive a complete description of a given image our method can be used as
  the basis for a range of face image interpretation tasks.
