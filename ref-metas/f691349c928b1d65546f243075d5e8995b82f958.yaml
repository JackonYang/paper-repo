paperAbstract: We introduce a new type of local feature based on the phase and amplitude
  responses of complex-valued steerable filters. The design of this local feature
  is motivated by a desire to obtain feature vectors which are semi-invariant under
  common image deformations, yet distinctive enough to provide useful identity information.
  A recent proposal for such local features involves combining differential invariants
  to particular image deformations, such as rotation. Our approach differs in that
  we consider a wider class of image deformations, including the addition of noise,
  along with both global and local brightness variations. We use steerable filters
  to make the feature robust to rotation. And we exploit the fact that phase data
  is often locally stable with respect to scale changes, noise, and common brightness
  changes. We provide empirical results comparing our local feature with one based
  on differential invariants. The results show that our phase-based local feature
  leads to better performance when dealing with common illumination changes and 2-D
  rotation, while giving comparable effects in terms of scale changes.
