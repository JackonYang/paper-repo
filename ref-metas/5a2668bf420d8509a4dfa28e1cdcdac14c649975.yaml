paperAbstract: We introduce a new type of top-level model for Deep Belief Nets and
  evaluate it on a 3D object recognition task. The top-level model is a third-order
  Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative
  and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform
  version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under different lighting
  conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which
  is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural
  net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms
  shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised
  learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition
  task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations
  to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount
  of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error.
