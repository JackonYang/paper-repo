paperAbstract: Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual
  system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the
  brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility
  of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object
  recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field
  based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant
  nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues.
  The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including
  rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster)
  objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented
  in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training
  views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that
  could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor
  of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations.
  Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object
  views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of
  15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation
  conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive
  noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence
  of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in
  the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast
  hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system
  relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture
  remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model.
