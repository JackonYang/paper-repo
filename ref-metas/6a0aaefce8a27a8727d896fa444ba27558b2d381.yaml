paperAbstract: Although it is well believed for years that modeling relations between
  objects would help object recognition, there has not been evidence that the idea
  is working in the deep learning era. All state-of-the-art object detection systems
  still rely on recognizing object instances individually, without exploiting their
  relations during learning. This work proposes an object relation module. It processes
  a set of objects simultaneously through interaction between their appearance feature
  and geometry, thus allowing modeling of their relations. It is lightweight and in-place.
  It does not require additional supervision and is easy to embed in existing networks.
  It is shown effective on improving object recognition and duplicate removal steps
  in the modern object detection pipeline. It verifies the efficacy of modeling object
  relations in CNN based detection. It gives rise to the first fully end-to-end object
  detector.
