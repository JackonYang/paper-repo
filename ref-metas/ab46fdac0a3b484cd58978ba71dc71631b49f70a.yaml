paperAbstract: "An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem.\
  \ The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different\
  \ orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the\
  \ equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered\
  \ images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends\
  \ of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching\
  \ takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in\
  \ the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019\
  s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small\
  \ masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is\
  \ stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\xBD-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal\
  \ provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological\
  \ data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made,\
  \ for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The\
  \ results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity\
  \ is necessary for the matching process."
