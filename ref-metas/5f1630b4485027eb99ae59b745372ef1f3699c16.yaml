paperAbstract: Previous approaches for scene text detection have already achieved
  promising performances across various benchmarks. However, they usually fall short
  when dealing with challenging scenarios, even when equipped with deep neural network
  models, because the overall performance is determined by the interplay of multiple
  stages and components in the pipelines. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful
  pipeline that yields fast and accurate text detection in natural scenes. The pipeline
  directly predicts words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and quadrilateral
  shapes in full images, eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps (e.g., candidate
  aggregation and word partitioning), with a single neural network. The simplicity
  of our pipeline allows concentrating efforts on designing loss functions and neural
  network architecture. Experiments on standard datasets including ICDAR 2015, COCO-Text
  and MSRA-TD500 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. On the ICDAR
  2015 dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves an F-score of 0.7820 at 13.2fps at
  720p resolution.
