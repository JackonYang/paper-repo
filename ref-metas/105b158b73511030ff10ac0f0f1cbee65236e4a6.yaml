paperAbstract: Because of the size of the World Wide Web and its inherent lack of
  structure, finding what one is looking for can be a challenge. PC-Meters March,
  1996, survey found that three of the five most visited Web sites were search engines.
  However, while Web pages typically contain both text and images, all the currently
  available search engines only index text. This paper describes WebSeer, a system
  for locating images on the Web. WebSeer uses image content in addition to associated
  text to index images, presenting the user with a selection that potentially fits
  her needs.
