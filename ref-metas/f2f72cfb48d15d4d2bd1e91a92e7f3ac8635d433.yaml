paperAbstract: "Open-text semantic parsers are designed to interpret any statement\
  \ in natural language by inferring a corresponding meaning representation (MR \u2013\
  \ a formal representation of its sense). Unfortunately, large scale systems cannot\
  \ be easily machine-learned due to a lack of directly supervised data. We propose\
  \ a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary\
  \ of more than 70,000 words mapped to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training\
  \ scheme that combines learning from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning\
  \ from raw text. The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and\
  \ MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data.\
  \ Hence, the system ends up providing methods for knowledge acquisition and wordsense\
  \ disambiguation within the context of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework.\
  \ Experiments on these various tasks indicate the promise of the approach."
