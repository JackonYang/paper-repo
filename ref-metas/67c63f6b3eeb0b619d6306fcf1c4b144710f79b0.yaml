paperAbstract: 'Recently Viola et al. have introduced a rapid object detection scheme
  based on a boosted cascade of simple feature classifiers. In this paper we introduce
  and empirically analysis two extensions to their approach: Firstly, a novel set
  of rotated haar-like features is introduced. These novel features significantly
  enrich the simple features of [6] and can also be calculated efficiently. With these
  new rotated features our sample face detector shows off on average a 10% lower false
  alarm rate at a given hit rate. Secondly, we present a through analysis of different
  boosting algorithms (namely Discrete, Real and Gentle Adaboost) and weak classifiers
  on the detection performance and computational complexity. We will see that Gentle
  Adaboost with small CART trees as base classifiers outperform Discrete Adaboost
  and stumps. The complete object detection training and detection system as well
  as a trained face detector are available in the Open Computer Vision Library at
  sourceforge.net [8].'
