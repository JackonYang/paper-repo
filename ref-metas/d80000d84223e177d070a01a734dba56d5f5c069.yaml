paperAbstract: SWITCHBOARD is a large multispeaker corpus of conversational speech
  and text which should be of interest to researchers in speaker authentication and
  large vocabulary speech recognition. About 2500 conversations by 500 speakers from
  around the US were collected automatically over T1 lines at Texas Instruments. Designed
  for training and testing of a variety of speech processing algorithms, especially
  in speaker verification, it has over an 1 h of speech from each of 50 speakers,
  and several minutes each from hundreds of others. A time-aligned word for word transcription
  accompanies each recording.<<ETX>>
