paperAbstract: "\u2018Invariant regions\u2019 are image patches that automatically\
  \ deform with changing viewpoint as to keep on covering identical physical parts\
  \ of a scene. Such regions are then described by a set of invariant features, which\
  \ makes it relatively easy to match them between views and under changing illumination.\
  \ In previous work, we have presented invariant regions that are based on a combination\
  \ of corners and edges. The application discussed then was image database retrieval.\
  \ Here, an alternative method for extracting (affinely) invariant regions is given,\
  \ that does not depend on the presence of edges or corners in the image but is purely\
  \ intensity-based. Also, we demonstrate the use of such regions for another application,\
  \ which is wide baseline stereo matching. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build\
  \ an opportunistic system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it\
  \ sees fit. This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider\
  \ range of images. To increase the robustness of the system even further, two semi-local\
  \ constraints on combinations of region correspondences are derived (one geometric,\
  \ the other photometric). They allow to test the consistency of correspondences\
  \ and hence to reject falsely matched regions."
