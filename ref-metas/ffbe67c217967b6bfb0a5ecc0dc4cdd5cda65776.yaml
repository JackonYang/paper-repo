paperAbstract: An original method for integrating artificial neural networks (ANN)
  with hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed. ANNs are suitable for performing phonetic
  classification, whereas HMMs have been proven successful at modeling the temporal
  structure of the speech signal. In the approach described, the ANN outputs constitute
  the sequence of observation vectors for the HMM. An algorithm is proposed for global
  optimization of all the parameters. Results on speaker-independent recognition experiments
  using this integrated ANN-HMM system on the TIMIT continuous speech database are
  reported.<<ETX>>
