paperAbstract: The need for natural and effective Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
  is increasingly important due to the prevalence of computers in human activities.
  Computer vision and pattern recognition continue to play a dominant role in the
  HCI realm. However, computer vision methods often fail to become pervasive in the
  field due to the lack of real-time, robust algorithms, and novel and convincing
  applications. This state-of-the-art contributed volumeis comprised of articles by
  prominent experts in computer vision, pattern recognition and HCI. It is the first
  published text to capture the latest research in this rapidly advancing field with
  exclusive focus on real-time algorithms and practical applications in diverse and
  numerous industries, and it outlines further challenges in these areas. Real-Time
  Vision for Human-Computer Interaction is an invaluable reference for HCI researchers
  in both academia and industry, and a useful supplement for advanced-level courses
  in HCI and Computer Vision.
