paperAbstract: "It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded\
  \ nondeterministic Turing machine can be \u201Creduced\u201D to the problem of determining\
  \ whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here \u201Creduced\u201D\
  \ means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically\
  \ in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From\
  \ this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it\
  \ is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial\
  \ degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is\
  \ isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method\
  \ of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is\
  \ introduced and discussed."
