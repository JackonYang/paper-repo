paperAbstract: Recently, a variety of real-world applications have triggered huge
  demand for techniques that can extract textual information from natural scenes.
  Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics
  in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection
  from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different
  from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters
  or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups
  and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments
  on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
  state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the
  proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios.
