paperAbstract: In an earlier paper, we introduced a new "boosting" algorithm called
  AdaBoost which, theoretically, can be used to significantly reduce the error of
  any learning algorithm that con- sistently generates classifiers whose performance
  is a little better than random guessing. We also introduced the related notion of
  a "pseudo-loss" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label
  concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this
  paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and
  without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of
  experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's "bagging" method when
  used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute-
  value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of
  machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more
  detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR
  problem.
