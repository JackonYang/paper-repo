paperAbstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) models typically operate with a fixed
  vocabulary, but translation is an open-vocabulary problem. Previous work addresses
  the translation of out-of-vocabulary words by backing off to a dictionary. In this
  paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, making the NMT model
  capable of open-vocabulary translation by encoding rare and unknown words as sequences
  of subword units. This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable
  via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration),
  compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological
  and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word
  segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation
  based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that
  subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation
  tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively.
