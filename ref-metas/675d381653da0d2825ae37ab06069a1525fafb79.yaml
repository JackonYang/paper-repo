paperAbstract: "I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed\
  \ non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based\
  \ on two opposing forces. For each represen-tational unit there is an adaptive predictor\
  \ which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries\
  \ to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages\
  \ each unit to lter\xE0bstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that\
  \ these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units\
  \ focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the\
  \ principle which aim at nding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e.\
  \ codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply\
  \ the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes\
  \ are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised\
  \ learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for nding factorial codes automatically\
  \ implement Occam's razor for nding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike\
  \ previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear\
  \ but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms\
  \ based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible.\
  \ The nal part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential\
  \ for learning unique representations of extended input sequences."
