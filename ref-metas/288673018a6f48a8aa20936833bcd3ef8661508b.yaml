paperAbstract: At the heart of today's information-explosion problems are issues involving
  semantics, mutual understanding, concept matching, and interoperability. Ontologies
  and the Semantic Web are offered as a potential solution, but creating ontologies
  for real-world knowledge is nontrivial. If we could automate the process, we could
  significantly improve our chances of making the Semantic Web a reality. While understanding
  natural language is difficult, tables and other structured information make it easier
  to interpret new items and relations. In this paper we introduce an approach to
  generating ontologies based on table analysis. We thus call our approach TANGO (Table
  ANalysis for Generating Ontologies). Based on conceptual modeling extraction techniques,
  TANGO attempts to (i) understand a table's structure and conceptual content; (ii)
  discover the constraints that hold between concepts extracted from the table; (iii)
  match the recognized concepts with ones from a more general specification of related
  concepts; and (iv) merge the resulting structure with other similar knowledge representations.
  TANGO is thus a formalized method of processing the format and content of tables
  that can serve to incrementally build a relevant reusable conceptual ontology.
