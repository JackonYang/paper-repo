paperAbstract: 'Single-word vector space models have been very successful at learning
  lexical information. However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer
  phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a
  recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations
  for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns
  a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent
  meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning
  of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of
  operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of
  the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment
  distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews
  and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between
  nouns using the syntactic path between them.'
