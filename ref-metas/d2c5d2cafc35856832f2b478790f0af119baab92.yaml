paperAbstract: 'We believe that the cluster assumption is key to successful semi-supervised
  learning. Based on this, we propose three semi-supervised algorithms: 1. deriving
  graph-based distances that emphazise low density regions between clusters, followed
  by training a standard SVM; 2. optimizing the Transductive SVM objective function,
  which places the decision boundary in low density regions, by gradient descent;
  3. combining the first two to make maximum use of the cluster assumption. We compare
  with state of the art algorithms and demonstrate superior accuracy for the latter
  two methods.'
