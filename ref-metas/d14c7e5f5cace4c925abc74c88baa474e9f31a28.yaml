paperAbstract: In this work, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
  The proposed RNN, gated-feedback RNN (GF-RNN), extends the existing approach of
  stacking multiple recurrent layers by allowing and controlling signals flowing from
  upper recurrent layers to lower layers using a global gating unit for each pair
  of layers. The recurrent signals exchanged between layers are gated adaptively based
  on the previous hidden states and the current input. We evaluated the proposed GF-RNN
  with different types of recurrent units, such as tanh, long short-term memory and
  gated recurrent units, on the tasks of character-level language modeling and Python
  program evaluation. Our empirical evaluation of different RNN units, revealed that
  in both tasks, the GF-RNN outperforms the conventional approaches to build deep
  stacked RNNs. We suggest that the improvement arises because the GFRNN can adaptively
  assign different layers to different timescales and layer-to-layer interactions
  (including the top-down ones which are not usually present in a stacked RNN) by
  learning to gate these interactions.
