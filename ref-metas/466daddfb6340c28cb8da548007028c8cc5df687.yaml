paperAbstract: An iterative algorithm is given for solving a system Ax=k of n linear
  equations in n unknowns. The solution is given in n steps. It is shown that this
  method is a special case of a very general method which also includes Gaussian elimination.
  These general algorithms are essentially algorithms for finding an n dimensional
  ellipsoid. Connections are made with the theory of orthogonal polynomials and continued
  fractions.
