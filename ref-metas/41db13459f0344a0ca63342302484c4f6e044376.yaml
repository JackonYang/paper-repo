paperAbstract: Archiving official written documents such as invoices, reminders and
  account statements in business and private area gets more and more important. Creating
  appropriate index entries for document archives like sender's name, creation date
  or document number is a tedious manual work. We present a novel approach to handle
  automatic indexing of documents based on generic positional extraction of index
  terms. For this purpose we apply the knowledge of document templates stored in a
  common full text search index to find index positions that were successfully extracted
  in the past.
