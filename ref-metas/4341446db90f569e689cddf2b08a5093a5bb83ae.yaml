paperAbstract: We present a simple new Monte Carlo algorithm for evaluating probabilities
  of observations in complex latent variable models, such as Deep Belief Networks.
  While the method is based on Markov chains, estimates based on short runs are formally
  unbiased. In expectation, the log probability of a test set will be underestimated,
  and this could form the basis of a probabilistic bound. The method is much cheaper
  than gold-standard annealing-based methods and only slightly more expensive than
  the cheapest Monte Carlo methods. We give examples of the new method substantially
  improving simple variational bounds at modest extra cost.
