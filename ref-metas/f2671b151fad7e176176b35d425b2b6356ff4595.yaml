paperAbstract: When documents are organized in a large number of topic categories,
  the categories are often arranged in a hierarchy. The U.S. patent database and Yahoo
  are two examples. This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classi
  er can be signi cantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We
  adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter
  estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust
  parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique
  for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales
  well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies. Experimental
  results on three real-world data sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web pages
  show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the traditional
  at classi er.
