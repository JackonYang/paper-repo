paperAbstract: The computational complexity of learning Boolean concepts from examples
  is investigated. It is shown for various classes of concept representations that
  these cannot be learned feasibly in a distribution-free sense unless R = NP. These
  classes include (a) disjunctions of two monomials, (b) Boolean threshold functions,
  and (c) Boolean formulas in which each variable occurs at most once. Relationships
  between learning of heuristics and finding approximate solutions to NP-hard optimization
  problems are given.
