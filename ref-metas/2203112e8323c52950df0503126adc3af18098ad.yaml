paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating human body pose in static
  images. This problem is challenging due to the high dimensional state space of body
  poses, the presence of pose ambiguity, and the need to segment the human body in
  an image. We use an image generative approach by modeling the human kinematics,
  the shape and the clothing probabilistically. These models are used for deriving
  a good likelihood measure to evaluate samples in the solution, space. We adopt a
  data-driven MCMC framework for searching the solution space efficiently. Our observation
  data include the face, head-shoulders contour, skin color blobs, and ridges; and
  they provide evidences on the positions of the head, shoulders and limbs. To translate
  these inferences into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of 'proposal maps',
  which is an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates
  during the MCMC search. As experimental results show, the proposed technique estimates
  the human 3D pose accurately on various test images.
