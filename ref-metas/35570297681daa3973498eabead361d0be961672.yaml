paperAbstract: Fair discriminative pedestrian finders are now available. In fact,
  these pedestrian finders make most errors on pedestrians in configurations that
  are uncommon in the training data, for example, mounting a bicycle. This is undesirable.
  However, the human configuration can itself be estimated discriminatively using
  structure learning. We demonstrate a pedestrian finder which first finds the most
  likely human pose in the window using a discriminative procedure trained with structure
  learning on a small dataset. We then present features (local histogram of oriented
  gradient and local PCA of gradient) based on that configuration to an SVM classifier.
  We show, using the INRIA Person dataset, that estimates of configuration significantly
  improve the accuracy of a discriminative pedestrian finder.
