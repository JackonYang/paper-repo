paperAbstract: Traditional methods of computer vision and machine learning cannot
  match human performance on tasks such as the recognition of handwritten digits or
  traffic signs. Our biologically plausible, wide and deep artificial neural network
  architectures can. Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all
  neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected
  neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner
  neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed
  in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast
  training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the
  first to achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark
  it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on
  a plethora of common image classification benchmarks.
