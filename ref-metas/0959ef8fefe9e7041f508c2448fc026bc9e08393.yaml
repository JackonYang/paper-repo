paperAbstract: 'Recognizing materials in real-world images is a challenging task.
  Real-world materials have rich surface texture, geometry, lighting conditions, and
  clutter, which combine to make the problem particularly difficult. In this paper,
  we introduce a new, large-scale, open dataset of materials in the wild, the Materials
  in Context Database (MINC), and combine this dataset with deep learning to achieve
  material recognition and segmentation of images in the wild. MINC is an order of
  magnitude larger than previous material databases, while being more diverse and
  well-sampled across its 23 categories. Using MINC, we train convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) for two tasks: classifying materials from patches, and simultaneous
  material recognition and segmentation in full images. For patch-based classification
  on MINC we found that the best performing CNN architectures can achieve 85.2% mean
  class accuracy. We convert these trained CNN classifiers into an efficient fully
  convolutional framework combined with a fully connected conditional random field
  (CRF) to predict the material at every pixel in an image, achieving 73.1% mean class
  accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that having a large, well-sampled dataset
  such as MINC is crucial for real-world material recognition and segmentation.'
