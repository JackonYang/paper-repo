paperAbstract: A large portion of real-world data is stored in commercial relational
  database systems. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work only with
  "flat" data representations. Thus, to apply these methods, we are forced to convert
  our data into a flat form, thereby losing much of the relational structure present
  in our database. This paper builds on the recent work on probabilistic relational
  models (PRMs), and describes how to learn them from databases. PRMs allow the properties
  of an object to depend probabilistically both on other properties of that object
  and on properties of related objects. Although PRMs are significantly more expressive
  than standard models, such as Bayesian networks, we show how to extend well-known
  statistical methods for learning Bayesian networks to learn these models. We describe
  both parameter estimation and structure learning -- the automatic induction of the
  dependency structure in a model. Moreover, we show how the learning procedure can
  exploit standard database retrieval techniques for efficient learning from large
  datasets. We present experimental results on both real and synthetic relational
  databases.
