paperAbstract: 'We introduce a weakly supervised approach for learning human actions
  modeled as interactions between humans and objects. Our approach is human-centric:
  We first localize a human in the image and then determine the object relevant for
  the action and its spatial relation with the human. The model is learned automatically
  from a set of still images annotated only with the action label. Our approach relies
  on a human detector to initialize the model learning. For robustness to various
  degrees of visibility, we build a detector that learns to combine a set of existing
  part detectors. Starting from humans detected in a set of images depicting the action,
  our approach determines the action object and its spatial relation to the human.
  Its final output is a probabilistic model of the human-object interaction, i.e.,
  the spatial relation between the human and the object. We present an extensive experimental
  evaluation on the sports action data set from [1], the PASCAL Action 2010 data set
  [2], and a new human-object interaction data set.'
