paperAbstract: Modelling compositional meaning for sentences using empirical distributional
  methods has been a challenge for computational linguists. We implement the abstract
  categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it.
  The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational
  words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based
  on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive
  sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our
  model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters
  them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic
  complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.
