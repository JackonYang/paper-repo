paperAbstract: We classify digits of real-world house numbers using convolutional
  neural networks (ConvNets). Con-vNets are hierarchical feature learning neural networks
  whose structure is biologically inspired. Unlike many popular vision approaches
  that are hand-designed, ConvNets can automatically learn a unique set of features
  optimized for a given task. We augmented the traditional ConvNet architecture by
  learning multi-stage features and by using Lp pooling and establish a new state-of-the-art
  of 95.10% accuracy on the SVHN dataset (48% error improvement). Furthermore, we
  analyze the benefits of different pooling methods and multi-stage features in ConvNets.
  The source code and a tutorial are available at eblearn.sf.net.
