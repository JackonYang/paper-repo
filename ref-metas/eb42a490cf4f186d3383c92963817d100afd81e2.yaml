paperAbstract: 'We present a new part-of-speech tagger that demonstrates the following
  ideas: (i) explicit use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency
  network representation, (ii) broad use of lexical features, including jointly conditioning
  on multiple consecutive words, (iii) effective use of priors in conditional loglinear
  models, and (iv) fine-grained modeling of unknown word features. Using these ideas
  together, the resulting tagger gives a 97.24% accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ,
  an error reduction of 4.4% on the best previous single automatically learned tagging
  result.'
