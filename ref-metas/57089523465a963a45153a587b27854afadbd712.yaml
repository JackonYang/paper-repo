paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a hybrid method consisting of three main
  stages for detecting tables in document images. Based on table structure, our system
  separates table into two main categories, ruling line table and non-ruling line
  table. In the first stage, the text and non-text elements in document are classified
  by a heuristic filter. Then, the white space analysis is used to group the text
  elements into text lines, while ruling line table candidates are identified from
  non-text elements. In the second stage, based on the text lines, text and non-text
  elements, a hybrid method which consist of the alternative bottom-up and top-down
  approaches is implemented to find the table region candidates. In the final stage,
  these candidates are examined to get the table regions by analyzing text lines and
  spare lines. Experimental results with the document database from the ICDAR2013
  table competition show that the proposed method works better than the previous ones.
