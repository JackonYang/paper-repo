paperAbstract: "In many documents, such as semi-structured webpages, textual semantics\
  \ are augmented with additional information conveyed using visual elements including\
  \ layout, font size, and color. Prior work on information extraction from semi-structured\
  \ websites has required learning an extraction model specific to a given template\
  \ via either manually labeled or distantly supervised data from that template. In\
  \ this work, we propose a solution for \u201Czero-shot\u201D open-domain relation\
  \ extraction from webpages with a previously unseen template, including from websites\
  \ with little overlap with existing sources of knowledge for distant supervision\
  \ and websites in entirely new subject verticals. Our model uses a graph neural\
  \ network-based approach to build a rich representation of text fields on a webpage\
  \ and the relationships between them, enabling generalization to new templates.\
  \ Experiments show this approach provides a 31% F1 gain over a baseline for zero-shot\
  \ extraction in a new subject vertical."
