paperAbstract: Many adaptive neural network theories are based on neuronlike adaptive
  elements that can behave as single unit analogs of associative conditioning. In
  this article we develop a similar adaptive element, but one which is more closely
  in accord with the facts of animal learning theory than elements commonly studied
  in adaptive network research. We suggest that an essential feature of classical
  conditioning that has been largely overlooked by adaptive network theorists is its
  predictive nature. The adaptive element we present learns to increase its response
  rate in anticipation of increased stimulation, producing a conditioned response
  before the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The element also is in strong
  agreement with the behavioral data regarding the effects of stimulus context, since
  it is a temporally refined extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model. We show by computer
  simulation that the element becomes sensitive to the most reliable, nonredundant,
  and earliest predictors of reinforcement . We also point out that the model solves
  many of the stability and saturation problems encountered in network simulations.
  Finally, we discuss our model in light of recent advances in the physiology and
  biochemistry of synaptic mechanisms.
