paperAbstract: We address the rating-inference problem, wherein rather than simply
  decide whether a review is "thumbs up" or "thumbs down", as in previous sentiment
  analysis work, one must determine an author's evaluation with respect to a multi-point
  scale (e.g., one to five "stars"). This task represents an interesting twist on
  standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees
  of similarity between class labels; for example, "three stars" is intuitively closer
  to "four stars" than to "one star".We first evaluate human performance at the task.
  Then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem,
  that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that
  similar items receive similar labels. We show that the meta-algorithm can provide
  significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when
  we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.
