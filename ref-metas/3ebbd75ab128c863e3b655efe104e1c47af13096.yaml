paperAbstract: Because of image sampling, traditional measures of pixel dissimilarity
  can assign a large value to two corresponding pixels in a stereo pair, even in the
  absence of noise and other degrading effects. We propose a measure of dissimilarity
  that is provably insensitive to sampling because it uses the linearly interpolated
  intensity functions surrounding the pixels. Experiments on real images show that
  our measure alleviates the problem of sampling with little additional computational
  overhead.
