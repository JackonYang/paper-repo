paperAbstract: In this paper we present an incremental framework aimed at extracting
  field information from administrative document images in the context of a Digital
  Mail-room scenario. Given a single training sample in which the user has marked
  which fields have to be extracted from a particular document class, a document model
  representing structural relationships among words is built. This model is incrementally
  refined as the system processes more and more documents from the same class. A reformulation
  of the tf-idf statistic scheme allows to adjust the importance weights of the structural
  relationships among words. We report in the experimental section our results obtained
  with a large dataset of real invoices.
