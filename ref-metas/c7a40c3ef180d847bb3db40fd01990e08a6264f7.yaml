paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning to map sentences to logical
  form, given training data consisting of natural language sentences paired with logical
  representations of their meaning. Previous approaches have been designed for particular
  natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general
  method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning
  of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete
  sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing
  all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm
  that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously estimating the parameters
  of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark
  data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations.
