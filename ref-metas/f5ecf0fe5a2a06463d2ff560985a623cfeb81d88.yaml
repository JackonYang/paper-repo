paperAbstract: Document images are degraded through bilevel processes such as scanning,
  printing, and photocopying. The resulting image degradations can be categorized
  based either on observable degradation features or on degradation model parameters.
  The degradation features can be related mathematically to model parameters. In this
  paper we statistically compare pairs of populations of degraded character images
  created with different model parameters. The changes in the probability that the
  characters are from different populations when the model parameters vary correlate
  with the relationship between observable degradation features and the model parameters.
  The paper also shows which features have the largest impact on the image.
