paperAbstract: We address recognition and localization of human actions in realistic
  scenarios. In contrast to the previous work studying human actions in controlled
  settings, here we train and test algorithms on real movies with substantial variation
  of actions in terms of subject appearance, motion, surrounding scenes, viewing angles
  and spatio-temporal extents. We introduce a new annotated human action dataset and
  use it to evaluate several existing methods. We in particular focus on boosted space-time
  window classifiers and introduce "keyframe priming" that combines discriminative
  models of human motion and shape within an action. Keyframe priming is shown to
  significantly improve the performance of action detection. We present detection
  results for the action class "drinking" evaluated on two episodes of the movie "Coffee
  and Cigarettes".
