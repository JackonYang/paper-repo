paperAbstract: This paper presents the Third PASCAL Recognising Textual Entailment
  Challenge (RTE-3), providing an overview of the dataset creating methodology and
  the submitted systems. In creating this year's dataset, a number of longer texts
  were introduced to make the challenge more oriented to realistic scenarios. Additionally,
  a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools.
  A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from
  identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions.
  26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting
  new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges.
