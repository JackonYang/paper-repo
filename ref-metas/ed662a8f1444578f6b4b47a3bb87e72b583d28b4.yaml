paperAbstract: In this paper we consider the challenging problem of articulated human
  pose estimation in still images. We observe that despite high variability of the
  body articulations, human motions and activities often simultaneously constrain
  the positions of multiple body parts. Modelling such higher order part dependencies
  seemingly comes at a cost of more expensive inference, which resulted in their limited
  use in state-of-the-art methods. In this paper we propose a model that incorporates
  higher order part dependencies while remaining efficient. We achieve this by defining
  a conditional model in which all body parts are connected a-priori, but which becomes
  a tractable tree-structured pictorial structures model once the image observations
  are available. In order to derive a set of conditioning variables we rely on the
  poselet-based features that have been shown to be effective for people detection
  but have so far found limited application for articulated human pose estimation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available pose
  estimation benchmarks improving or being on-par with state of the art in each case.
