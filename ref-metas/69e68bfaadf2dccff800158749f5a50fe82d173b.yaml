paperAbstract: "A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition\
  \ is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by \u201Clearning without\
  \ a teacher\u201D, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based\
  \ on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their\
  \ positions. This network is given a nickname \u201Cneocognitron\u201D. After completion\
  \ of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model\
  \ of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits\
  \ of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a\
  \ number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells\
  \ connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201CS-cells\u201D\
  , which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex\
  \ cells, and the second layer consists of \u201CC-cells\u201D similar to complex\
  \ cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell\
  \ have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised\
  \ learning: We do not need any \u201Cteacher\u201D during the process of self-organization,\
  \ and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the\
  \ input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer.\
  \ After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern\
  \ has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer,\
  \ and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus\
  \ pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than\
  \ one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected\
  \ by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in\
  \ shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."
