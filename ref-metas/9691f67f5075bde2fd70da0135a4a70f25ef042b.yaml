paperAbstract: "We describe and analyze a simple and effective stochastic sub-gradient\
  \ descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem cast by Support Vector\
  \ Machines (SVM). We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution\
  \ of accuracy $${\\epsilon}$$ is $${\\tilde{O}(1 / \\epsilon)}$$, where each iteration\
  \ operates on a single training example. In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic\
  \ gradient descent methods for SVMs require $${\\Omega(1 / \\epsilon^2)}$$ iterations.\
  \ As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly\
  \ with 1/\u03BB, where \u03BB is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear\
  \ kernel, the total run-time of our method is $${\\tilde{O}(d/(\\lambda \\epsilon))}$$,\
  \ where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the\
  \ run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting\
  \ algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach\
  \ also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective\
  \ function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training\
  \ set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification\
  \ problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM\
  \ learning methods."
