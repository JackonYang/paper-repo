paperAbstract: "We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that\
  \ uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued \u201Cvisible\u201D\
  \ variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each\
  \ time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last\
  \ few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efficient and allows\
  \ us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model finds\
  \ a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds\
  \ of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion\
  \ sequences and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during motion capture."
