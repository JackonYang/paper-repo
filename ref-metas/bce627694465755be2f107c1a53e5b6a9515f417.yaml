paperAbstract: Methods are presented 1) to partition or decompose a visual scene into
  the bodies forming it; 2) to position these bodies in three-dimensional space, by
  combining two scenes that make a stereoscopic pair; 3) to find the regions or zones
  of a visual scene that belong to its background; 4) to carry out the isolation of
  the objects in 1) when the input has inaccuracies. Running computer programs implement
  the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional
  line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing
  flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are
  made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human
  visual perception. The main conclusion is that it is possible to separate a picture
  or scene into the constituent objects exclusively on the basis of monocular geometric
  properties (on the basis of pure form); in fact, successful methods are shown.
