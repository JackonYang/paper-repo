paperAbstract: 'This paper describes a new bottom-up method for document layout analysis.
  The algorithm was implemented in the CLIDE (Chemical Literature Data Extraction)
  system, but the method described here is suitable for a broader range of documents.
  It is based on Kruskal''s algorithm and uses a special distance-metric between the
  components to construct the physical page structure. The method has all the major
  advantages of bottom-up systems: independence from different text spacing and independence
  from different block alignments. The algorithms computational complexity is reduced
  to linear by using heuristics and path-compression.'
