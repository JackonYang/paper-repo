paperAbstract: In the query by image content (QBIC) project we are studying methods
  to query large on-line image databases using the images' content as the basis of
  the queries. Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of
  image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other
  images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give
  me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in
  art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation
  and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality,
  retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image
  example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation,
  high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population.
  We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000
  that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000
  objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper
  we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we
  use, show example query results, and discuss future directions.
