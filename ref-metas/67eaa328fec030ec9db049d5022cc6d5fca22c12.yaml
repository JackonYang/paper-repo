paperAbstract: We propose a theoretical framework for doing speech recognition with
  segmental conditional random fields, and describe the impleme-nation of a toolkit
  for experimenting with these models. This framework allows users to easily incorporate
  multiple detector streams into a discriminatively trained direct model for large
  vocabulary continuous speech recognition. The detector streams can operate at multiple
  scales (frame, phone, multi-phone, syllable or word) and are combined at the word
  level in the CRF training and decoding processes. A key aspect of our approach is
  that features are defined at the word level, and can thus identify long span phenomena
  such as the edit distance between an observed and expected sequence of detection
  events. Further, a wide variety of features are automatically constructed from atomic
  detector streams, allowing the user to focus on the creation of informative detectors.
  Generalization to unseen words is possible through the use of decomposable consistency
  features [1, 2], and our framework allows for the joint or separate training of
  the acoustic and language models.
