  \ paperl does not attempt to present a semantic theory of a natural language, but\
  \ rather to characterize the form of such a theory. A semantic theory of a natural\
  \ language is part of a linguistic description of that language. Our problem, on\
  \ the other hand, is part of the general theory of language, fully on a par with\
  \ the problem of characterizing the structure of grammars of natural languages.\
  \ A characterization of the abstract form of a semantic theory is given by a metatheory\
  \ which answers such questions as these: What is the domain of a semantic theory?\
  \ What are the descriptive and explanatory goals of a semantic theory? What mechanisms\
  \ are employed in pursuit of these goals? What are the empirical and methodological\
  \ constraints upon a semantic theory? The present paper approaches the problem of\
  \ characterizing the form of semantic theories by describing the structure of a\
  \ semantic theory of English. There can be little doubt but that the results achieved\
  \ will apply directly to semantic theories of languages closely related to English.\
  \ The question of their applicability to semantic theories of more distant languages\
  \ will be left for subsequent investigations to explore. Nevertheless, the present\
  \ investigation will provide results that can be applied to semantic theories of\
  \ languages unrelated to English and suggestions about how to proceed with the construction\
  \ of such theories. We may put our problem this way: What form should a semantic\
  \ theory of a natural language take to accommodate in the most revealing way the\
  \ facts about the semantic structure of that language supplied by descriptive research?\
  \ This question is of primary importance at the present stage of the development\
  \ of semantics because semantics suffers not from a dearth of facts about meanings\
  \ and meaning relations in natural languages, but rather from the lack of an adequate\
  \ theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these facts. Facts about the semantics\
  \ of natural languages have been contributed in abundance by many diverse fields,\
  \ including philosophy, linguistics, philology, and \u2026"
