paperAbstract: 'We introduce (1) a novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar
  formalism for bilingual language modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept
  of bilingual parsing with a variety of parallel corpus analysis applications. Aside
  from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from
  the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics:
  it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a
  minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation
  admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient
  normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism''s expressiveness suggests
  that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages,
  balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number
  of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints
  to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing,
  phrasal alignment, and parsing.'
