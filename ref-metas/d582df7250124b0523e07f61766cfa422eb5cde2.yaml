paperAbstract: Sets of local features that are invariant to common image transformations
  are an effective representation to use when comparing images; current methods typically
  judge feature sets' similarity via a voting scheme (which ignores co-occurrence
  statistics) or by comparing histograms over a set of prototypes (which must be found
  by clustering). We present a method for efficiently comparing images based on their
  discrete distributions (bags) of distinctive local invariant features, without clustering
  descriptors. Similarity between images is measured with an approximation of the
  Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which quickly computes minimal-cost correspondences
  between two bags of features. Each image's feature distribution is mapped into a
  normed space with a low-distortion embedding of EMD. Examples most similar to a
  novel query image are retrieved in time sublinear in the number of examples via
  approximate nearest neighbor search in the embedded space. We evaluate our method
  with scene, object, and texture recognition tasks.
