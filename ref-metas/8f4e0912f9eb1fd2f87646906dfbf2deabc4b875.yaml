paperAbstract: "We propose an approach for information extraction for multi-page printed\
  \ document understanding. The approach is designed for scenarios in which the set\
  \ of possible document classes, i.e., documents sharing similar content and layout,\
  \ is large and may evolve over time. Describing a new class is a very simple task:\
  \ the operator merely provides a few samples and then, by means of a GUI, clicks\
  \ on the OCR-generated blocks of a document containing the information to be extracted.\
  \ Our approach is based on probability: we derived a general form for the probability\
  \ that a sequence of blocks contains the searched information. We estimate the parameters\
  \ for a new class by applying the maximum likelihood method to the samples of the\
  \ class. All these parameters depend only on block properties that can be extracted\
  \ automatically from the operator actions on the GUI. Processing a document of a\
  \ given class consists in finding the sequence of blocks, which maximizes the corresponding\
  \ probability for that class. We evaluated experimentally our proposal using 807\
  \ multi-page printed documents of different domains (invoices, patents, data-sheets),\
  \ obtaining very good results\u2014e.g., a success rate often greater than 90% even\
  \ for classes with just two samples."
