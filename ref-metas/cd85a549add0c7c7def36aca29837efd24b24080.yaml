paperAbstract: While depth tends to improve network performances, it also makes gradient-based
  training more difficult since deeper networks tend to be more non-linear. The recently
  proposed knowledge distillation approach is aimed at obtaining small and fast-to-execute
  models, and it has shown that a student network could imitate the soft output of
  a larger teacher network or ensemble of networks. In this paper, we extend this
  idea to allow the training of a student that is deeper and thinner than the teacher,
  using not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by
  the teacher as hints to improve the training process and final performance of the
  student. Because the student intermediate hidden layer will generally be smaller
  than the teacher's intermediate hidden layer, additional parameters are introduced
  to map the student hidden layer to the prediction of the teacher hidden layer. This
  allows one to train deeper students that can generalize better or run faster, a
  trade-off that is controlled by the chosen student capacity. For example, on CIFAR-10,
  a deep student network with almost 10.4 times less parameters outperforms a larger,
  state-of-the-art teacher network.
