paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a neural network-based face detection system.
  Unlike similar systems which are limited to detecting upright, frontal faces, this
  system detects faces at any degree of rotation in the image plane. The system employs
  multiple networks; a "router" network first processes each input window to determine
  its orientation and then uses this information to prepare the window for one or
  more "detector" networks. We present the training methods for both types of networks.
  We also perform sensitivity analysis on the networks, and present empirical results
  on a large test set. Finally, we present preliminary results for detecting faces
  rotated out of the image plane, such as profiles and semi-profiles.
