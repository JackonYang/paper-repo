paperAbstract: Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing
  and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation
  is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest
  in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose
  an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set
  of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary
  of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training
  set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict
  the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used
  to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that
  relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments
  show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost
  six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence
  model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation.
  Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for
  the task of image annotation and retrieval.
