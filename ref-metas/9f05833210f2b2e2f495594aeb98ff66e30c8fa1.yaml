paperAbstract: A method for automatically evaluating the quality of document page
  segmentation algorithms is introduced. Many different zoning techniques are now
  available but there is no robust method available to benchmark and evaluate them
  reliably. Our proposed strategy is a region-based approach, in which segmentation
  results are compared with manually generated "ground truth files", describing all
  possible correct segmentations. A segmentation ground truthing scheme has been proposed.
  The evaluation of segmentation quality is achieved by testing the overlap between
  the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as the "black" pixels
  contained in the extracted polygons. An explicit specification of segmentation errors
  and a numerical evaluation are derived. The algorithm is simple and fast, and provides
  a multi-level output for each segmentation.<<ETX>>
