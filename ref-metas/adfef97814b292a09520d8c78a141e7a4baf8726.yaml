paperAbstract: After presenting a novel O(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar,
  we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. We propose (a) a lexical
  affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model
  where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative
  model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure
  without regard to the implications for the hearer. We also give preliminary empirical
  results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated Wall
  Street Journal training text (derived from the Penn Treebank). In these results,
  the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about
  equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
