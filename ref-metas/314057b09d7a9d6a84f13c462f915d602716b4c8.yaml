paperAbstract: The present study evaluates a class of models of human information
  processing made popular by Broadbent. A brief tachistoscopic display of one or two
  single letters, four-letter common words, or four-letter nonwords was immediately
  followed by a masking field along with two single-letter response alternatives chosen
  so as to minimize informational differences among the tasks. Giving 5s response
  alternatives before the stimulus display as well as after it caused an impairment
  of performance. Performance on single words was clearly better than performance
  on single letters. The data suggest that the first stages of information processing
  are done in parallel, but scanning of the resultant highly processed information
  is done serially.
