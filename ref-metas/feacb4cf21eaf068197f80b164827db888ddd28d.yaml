paperAbstract: Many image segmentation algorithms first generate an affinity graph
  and then partition it. We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity
  graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by
  human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning
  algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard
  hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation
  problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy
  (EM) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the
  raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation
  accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast
  to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed
  image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize
  effectively to arbitrary image types.
