paperAbstract: Many efforts have been made to discriminate, categorize, and quantitate
  patterns, and to reduce them into a usable machine language. The results have ordinarily
  been methods or devices with a high degree of specificity. For example, some devices
  require a special type font; others can read only one type font; still others require
  magnetic ink.
