paperAbstract: Current approaches to semantic parsing, the task of converting text
  to a formal meaning representation, rely on annotated training data mapping sentences
  to logical forms. Providing this supervision is a major bottleneck in scaling semantic
  parsers. This paper presents a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision
  burden. We develop two novel learning algorithms capable of predicting complex structures
  which only rely on a binary feedback signal based on the context of an external
  world. In addition we reformulate the semantic parsing problem to reduce the dependency
  of the model on syntactic patterns, thus allowing our parser to scale better using
  less supervision. Our results surprisingly show that without using any annotated
  meaning representations learning with a weak feedback signal is capable of producing
  a parser that is competitive with fully supervised parsers.
