paperAbstract: "Scene text recognition has been a hot research topic in computer vision\
  \ due to its various applications. The state of the art is the attention-based encoder-decoder\
  \ framework that learns the mapping between input images and output sequences in\
  \ a purely data-driven way. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods\
  \ perform poorly on complicated and/or low-quality images. One major reason is that\
  \ existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between feature areas and targets\
  \ for such images. We call this phenomenon \u201Cattention drift\u201D. To tackle\
  \ this problem, in this paper we propose the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention\
  \ Network) method that employs a focusing attention mechanism to automatically draw\
  \ back the drifted attention. FAN consists of two major components: an attention\
  \ network (AN) that is responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing\
  \ methods, and a focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention\
  \ by evaluating whether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images.\
  \ Furthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based network\
  \ to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive experiments on\
  \ various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the\
  \ FAN method substantially outperforms the existing methods."
