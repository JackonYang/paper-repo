paperAbstract: This paper presents a new approach to perform the estimation of the
  translation model probabilities of a phrase-based statistical machine translation
  system. We use neural networks to directly learn the translation probability of
  phrase pairs using continuous representations. The system can be easily trained
  on the same data used to build standard phrase-based systems. We provide experimental
  evidence that the approach seems to be able to infer meaningful translation probabilities
  for phrase pairs not seen in the training data, or even predict a list of the most
  likely translations given a source phrase. The approach can be used to rescore n-best
  lists, but we also discuss an integration into the Moses decoder. A preliminary
  evaluation on the English/French IWSLT task achieved improvements in the BLEU score
  and a human analysis showed that the new model often chooses semantically better
  translations. Several extensions of this work are discussed.
