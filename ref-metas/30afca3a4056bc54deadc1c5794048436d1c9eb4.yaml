paperAbstract: We describe a graphical model for probabilistic relationships--an alternative
  to the Bayesian network--called a dependency network. The graph of a dependency
  network, unlike a Bayesian network, is potentially cyclic. The probability component
  of a dependency network, like a Bayesian network, is a set of conditional distributions,
  one for each node given its parents. We identify several basic properties of this
  representation and describe a computationally efficient procedure for learning the
  graph and probability components from data. We describe the application of this
  representation to probabilistic inference, collaborative filtering (the task of
  predicting preferences), and the visualization of acausal predictive relationships.
