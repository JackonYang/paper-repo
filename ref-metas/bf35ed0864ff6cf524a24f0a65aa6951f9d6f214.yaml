paperAbstract: Word sense disambiguation has been recognized as a major problem in
  natural language processing research for over forty years. Both quantitive and qualitative
  methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties
  in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and
  training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods
  that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of
  a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of
  the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the
  noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer
  this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of
  known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in
  related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed
  method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that
  are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method
  was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics.
