paperAbstract: Named entity recognition, and other information extraction tasks, frequently
  use linguistic features such as part of speech tags or chunkings. For languages
  where word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is a
  key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word boundary
  tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying these boundaries
  may provide richer information for an NER system. New state-of-the-art word segmentation
  systems use neural models to learn representations for predicting word boundaries.
  We show that these same representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield
  significant improvements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly
  training NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5% absolute
  improvement over previously published results.
