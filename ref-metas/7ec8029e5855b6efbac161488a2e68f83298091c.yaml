paperAbstract: "We report a novel possibility for extracting a small subset of a data\
  \ base which contains all the information necessary to solve a given classification\
  \ task: using the Support Vector Algorithm to train three different types of handwritten\
  \ digit classifiers, we observed that these types of classifiers construct their\
  \ decision surface from strongly overlapping small (\u2248 4%) subsets of the data\
  \ base. This finding opens up the possibility of compressing data bases significantly\
  \ by disposing of the data which is not important for the solution of a given task.\
  \ \n \nIn addition, we show that the theory allows us to predict the classifier\
  \ that will have the best generalization ability, based solely on performance on\
  \ the training set and characteristics of the learning machines. This finding is\
  \ important for cases where the amount of available data is limited."
