paperAbstract: "Several graph theoretic cluster techniques aimed at the automatic\
  \ generation of thesauri for information retrieval systems are explored. Experimental\
  \ cluster analysis is performed on a sample corpus of 2267 documents. A term-term\
  \ similarity matrix is constructed for the 3950 unique terms used to index the documents.\
  \ Various threshold values, T, are applied to the similarity matrix to provide a\
  \ series of binary threshold matrices. The corresponding graph of each binary threshold\
  \ matrix is used to obtain the term clusters.\nThree definitions of a cluster are\
  \ analyzed: (1) the connected components of the threshold matrix; (2) the maximal\
  \ complete subgraphs of the connected components of the threshold matrix; (3) clusters\
  \ of the maximal complete subgraphs of the threshold matrix, as described by Gotlieb\
  \ and Kumar.\nAlgorithms are described and analyzed for obtaining each cluster type.\
  \ The algorithms are designed to be useful for large document and index collections.\
  \ Two algorithms have been tested that find maximal complete subgraphs. An algorithm\
  \ developed by Bierstone offers a significant time improvement over one suggested\
  \ by Bonner.\nFor threshold levels T \u2265 0.6, basically the same clusters are\
  \ developed regardless of the cluster definition used. In such situations one need\
  \ only find the connected components of the graph to develop the clusters."
