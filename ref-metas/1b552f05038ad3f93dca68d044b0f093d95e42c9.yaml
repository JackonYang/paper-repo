paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, based on stroke components
  and descriptive Gabor filters, to detect text regions in natural scene images. Text
  characters and strings are constructed by stroke components as basic units. Gabor
  filters are used to describe and analyze the stroke components in text characters
  or strings. We define a suitability measurement to analyze the confidence of Gabor
  filters in describing stroke component and the suitability of Gabor filters on an
  image window. From the training set, we compute a set of Gabor filters that can
  describe principle stroke components of text by their parameters. Then a K-means
  algorithm is applied to cluster the descriptive Gabor filters. The clustering centers
  are defined as Stroke Gabor Words (SGWs) to provide a universal description of stroke
  components. By suitability evaluation on positive and negative training samples
  respectively, each SGW generates a pair of characteristic distributions of suitability
  measurements. On a testing natural scene image, heuristic layout analysis is applied
  first to extract candidate image windows. Then we compute the principle SGWs for
  each image window to describe its principle stroke components. Characteristic distributions
  generated by principle SGWs are used to classify text or non-text windows. Experimental
  results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can handle complex
  backgrounds and variant text patterns (font, color, scale, etc.).
