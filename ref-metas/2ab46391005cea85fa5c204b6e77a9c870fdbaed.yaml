paperAbstract: No feature-based vision system can work unless good features can be
  identified and tracked from frame to frame. Although tracking itself is by and large
  a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to
  physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion
  that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and
  a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features
  that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new
  tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to
  work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations
  and experiments.<<ETX>>
