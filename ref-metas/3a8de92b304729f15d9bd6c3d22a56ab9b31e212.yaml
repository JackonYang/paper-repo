paperAbstract: Several algorithms have been developed in the past that attempt to
  resolve categorial ambiguities in natural language text without recourse to syntactic
  or semantic level information. An innovative method (called "CLAWS") was recently
  developed by those working with the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English.
  This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence
  of particular tags. Its accuracy is high, but it is very slow, and it has been manually
  augmented in a number of ways. The effects upon accuracy of this manual augmentation
  are not individually known.The current paper presents an algorithm for disambiguation
  that is similar to CLAWS but that operates in linear rather than in exponential
  time and space, and which minimizes the unsystematic augments. Tests of the algorithm
  using the million words of the Brown Standard Corpus of English are reported; the
  overall accuracy is 96%. This algorithm can provide a fast and accurate front end
  to any parsing or natural language processing system for English.
