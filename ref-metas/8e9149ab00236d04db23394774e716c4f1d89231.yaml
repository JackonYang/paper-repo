paperAbstract: 'Image-based sequence recognition has been a long-standing research
  topic in computer vision. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text
  recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based
  sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature
  extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed.
  Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture
  possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast
  to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned.
  (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character
  segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined
  lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based
  scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model,
  which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on
  standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets,
  demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover,
  the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition,
  which evidently verifies the generality of it.'
