paperAbstract: Adaptive sparse coding methods learn a possibly overcomplete set of
  basis functions, such that natural image patches can be reconstructed by linearly
  combining a small subset of these bases. The applicability of these methods to visual
  object recognition tasks has been limited because of the prohibitive cost of the
  optimization algorithms required to compute the sparse representation. In this work
  we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to learn basis functions. After training,
  this model also provides a fast and smooth approximator to the optimal representation,
  achieving even better accuracy than exact sparse coding algorithms on visual object
  recognition tasks.
