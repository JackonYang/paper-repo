paperAbstract: 'Abstract: How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed
  probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable
  posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational
  inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild
  differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions
  is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound
  yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard
  stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous
  latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient
  by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the
  intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages
  are reflected in experimental results.'
