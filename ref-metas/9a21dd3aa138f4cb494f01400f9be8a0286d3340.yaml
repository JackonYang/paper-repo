paperAbstract: 'Cascade detectors have been shown to operate extremely rapidly, with
  high accuracy, and have important applications such as face detection. Driven by
  this success, cascade learning has been an area of active research in recent years.
  Nevertheless, there are still challenging technical problems during the training
  process of cascade detectors. In particular, determining the optimal target detection
  rate for each stage of the cascade remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we
  propose the multiple instance pruning (MIP) algorithm for soft cascades. This algorithm
  computes a set of thresholds which aggressively terminate computation with no reduction
  in detection rate or increase in false positive rate on the training dataset. The
  algorithm is based on two key insights: i) examples that are destined to be rejected
  by the complete classifier can be safely pruned early; ii) face detection is a multiple
  instance learning problem. The MIP process is fully automatic and requires no assumptions
  of probability distributions, statistical independence, or ad hoc intermediate rejection
  targets. Experimental results on the MIT+CMU dataset demonstrate significant performance
  advantages.'
