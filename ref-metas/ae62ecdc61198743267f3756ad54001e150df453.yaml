paperAbstract: 'We consider approximate solutions $f_{n,\lambda } $ to linear operator
  equations $\mathcal{K}f = g$, of the form: $f_{n,\lambda } $ is the minimizer in
  $\mathcal{H}$ of $({1 / n})\sum _{j = 1}^n {[(\mathcal{K}h)(t_j ) - y(t_j )]} ^2
  + \lambda \| h \|^2 $, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a Hilbert space, and the data $\{
  {y(t_j )} \}$ satisfy $y(t_j ) = g(t_j ) + \varepsilon (t_j )$, the $\{ {\varepsilon
  (t_j )} \}$ being measurement errors. $f_{n,\lambda } $ is the so-called regularized
  solution, and $\lambda > 0$ is the regularization parameter, to be chosen. It is
  important to choose $\lambda $ correctly. The purpose of this paper is to propose
  the method of weighted cross-validation for choosing $\lambda $from the data. We
  suppose that g is very smooth and the errors are white noise. It is shown that the
  weighted cross-validation estimate $\hat \lambda $ estimates the value of $\lambda
  $ which minimizes $({1 / n})E\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {[(\mathcal{K}f_{n,\lambda
  } )(t_j ) - (\mathcal{K}f)(t_j )]} ^2 $ . Resul...'
