paperAbstract: SRILM is a collection of C++ libraries, executable programs, and helper
  scripts designed to allow both production of and experimentation with statistical
  language models for speech recognition and other applications. SRILM is freely available
  for noncommercial purposes. The toolkit supports creation and evaluation of a variety
  of language model types based on N-gram statistics, as well as several related tasks,
  such as statistical tagging and manipulation of N-best lists and word lattices.
  This paper summarizes the functionality of the toolkit and discusses its design
  and implementation, highlighting ease of rapid prototyping, reusability, and combinability
  of tools.
