paperAbstract: Document image analysis is the automatic computer interpretation of
  images of printed and handwritten documents, including text, drawings, maps, music
  scores, etc. Research in this field supports a rapidly growing international industry.
  This is the first book to offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art research papers,
  including authoritative critical surveys of the literature, and parallel studies
  of the architectureof complete high-performance printed-document reading systems.
  A unique feature is the extended section on music notation, an ideal vehicle for
  international sharing of basic research. Also, the collection includes important
  new work on line drawings, handwriting, character and symbol recognition, and basic
  methodological issues. The IAPR 1990 Workshop on Syntactic and Structural Pattern
  Recognition is summarized,including the reports of its expert working groups, whose
  debates provide a fascinating perspective on the field. The book is an excellent
  text for a first-year graduate seminar in document image analysis,and is likely
  to remain a standard reference in the field for years.
