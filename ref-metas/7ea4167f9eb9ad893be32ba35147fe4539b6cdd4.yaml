paperAbstract: We describe a system which is capable of learning the presentation
  of document logical structures, exemplarily shown for business letters. Presenting
  a set of instances to the system, it clusters them into structural concepts and
  induces a concept hierarchy. This concept hierarchy is taken as a source for classifying
  future input. The paper introduces the different learning steps, describes how the
  resulting concept hierarchy is applied for logical labeling and reports on the results.
