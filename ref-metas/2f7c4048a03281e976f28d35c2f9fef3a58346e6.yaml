paperAbstract: Do you want your neural net algorithm to learn sequences? Do not limit
  yourself to conventional gradient descent (or approximations thereof). Instead,
  use your sequence learning algorithm (any will do) to implement the following method
  for history compression. No matter what your final goals are, train a network to
  predict its next input from the previous ones. Since only unpredictable inputs convey
  new information, ignore all predictable inputs but let all unexpected inputs (plus
  information about the time step at which they occurred) become inputs to a higher-level
  network of the same kind (working on a slower, self-adjusting time scale). Go on
  building a hierarchy of such networks. This principle reduces the descriptions of
  event sequences without loss of information, thus easing supervised or reinforcement
  learning tasks. Alternatively, you may use two recurrent networks to collapse a
  multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that
  systems based on these principles can require less computation per time step and
  many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent
  nets. Finally you can modify the above method such that predictability is not defined
  in a yes-or-no fashion but in a continuous fashion.
