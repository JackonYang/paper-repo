paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe an abstract framework and axioms under which
  exact local computation of marginals is possible. The primitive objects of the framework
  are variables and valuations. The primitive operators of the framework are combination
  and marginalization. These operate on valuations. We state three axioms for these
  operators and we derive the possibility of local computation from the axioms. Next,
  we describe a propagation scheme for computing marginals of a valuation when we
  have a factorization of the valuation on a hypertree. Finally we show how the problem
  of computing marginals of joint probability distributions and joint belief functions
  fits the general framework.
