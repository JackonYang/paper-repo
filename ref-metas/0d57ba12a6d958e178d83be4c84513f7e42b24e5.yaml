paperAbstract: Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets.
  However, larger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that
  impede research and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential
  solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers.
  Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large, which
  implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper, we empirically
  show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties,
  but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically,
  we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192
  images. To achieve this result, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule
  for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup
  scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple
  techniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192
  on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity
  hardware, our implementation achieves ~90% scaling efficiency when moving from 8
  to 256 GPUs. Our findings enable training visual recognition models on internet-scale
  data with high efficiency.
