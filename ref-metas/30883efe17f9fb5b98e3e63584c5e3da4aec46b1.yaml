paperAbstract: Automatic transformation of paper documents into electronic documents
  requires geometric document layout analysis at the first stage. However, variations
  in character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures have
  made it difficult to design a general-purpose document layout analysis algorithm
  for many years. The use of some parameters has therefore been unavoidable in previous
  methods. The authors propose a parameter-free method for segmenting the document
  images into maximal homogeneous regions and identifying them as texts, images, tables,
  and ruling lines. A pyramidal quadtree structure is constructed for multiscale analysis
  and a periodicity measure is suggested to find a periodical attribute of text regions
  for page segmentation. To obtain robust page segmentation results, a confirmation
  procedure using texture analysis is applied to only ambiguous regions. Based on
  the proposed periodicity measure, multiscale analysis, and confirmation procedure,
  we could develop a robust method for geometric document layout analysis independent
  of character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures. The
  proposed method was experimented with the document database from the University
  of Washington and the MediaTeam Document Database. The results of these tests have
  shown that the proposed method provides more accurate results than previous ones.
