paperAbstract: 'The main challenge in articulated body motion tracking is the large
  number of degrees of freedom (around 30) to be recovered. Search algorithms, either
  deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul
  of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints:
  either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion
  trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from
  articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast,
  we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive
  assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified
  particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation
  principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness
  function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown
  to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently.'
