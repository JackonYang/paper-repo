paperAbstract: 'Learning long term dependencies in recurrent networks is difficult
  due to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome this difficulty, researchers
  have developed sophisticated optimization techniques and network architectures.
  In this paper, we propose a simpler solution that use recurrent neural networks
  composed of rectified linear units. Key to our solution is the use of the identity
  matrix or its scaled version to initialize the recurrent weight matrix. We find
  that our solution is comparable to LSTM on our four benchmarks: two toy problems
  involving long-range temporal structures, a large language modeling problem and
  a benchmark speech recognition problem.'
