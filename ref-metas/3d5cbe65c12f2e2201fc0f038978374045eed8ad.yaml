paperAbstract: We present a method that can dramatically accelerate object detection
  with part based models. The method is based on the observation that the cost of
  detection is likely to be dominated by the cost of matching each part to the image,
  and not by the cost of computing the optimal configuration of the parts as commonly
  assumed. Therefore accelerating detection requires minimizing the number of part-to-image
  comparisons. To this end we propose a multiple-resolutions hierarchical part based
  model and a corresponding coarse-to-fine inference procedure that recursively eliminates
  from the search space unpromising part placements. The method yields a ten-fold
  speedup over the standard dynamic programming approach and is complementary to the
  cascade-of-parts approach of [9]. Compared to the latter, our method does not have
  parameters to be determined empirically, which simplifies its use during the training
  of the model. Most importantly, the two techniques can be combined to obtain a very
  significant speedup, of two orders of magnitude in some cases. We evaluate our method
  extensively on the PASCAL VOC and INRIA datasets, demonstrating a very high increase
  in the detection speed with little degradation of the accuracy.
