paperAbstract: We propose a novel approach to both learning and detecting local contour-based
  representations for mid-level features. Our features, called sketch tokens, are
  learned using supervised mid-level information in the form of hand drawn contours
  in images. Patches of human generated contours are clustered to form sketch token
  classes and a random forest classifier is used for efficient detection in novel
  images. We demonstrate our approach on both top-down and bottom-up tasks. We show
  state-of-the-art results on the top-down task of contour detection while being over
  200x faster than competing methods. We also achieve large improvements in detection
  accuracy for the bottom-up tasks of pedestrian and object detection as measured
  on INRIA and PASCAL, respectively. These gains are due to the complementary information
  provided by sketch tokens to low-level features such as gradient histograms.
