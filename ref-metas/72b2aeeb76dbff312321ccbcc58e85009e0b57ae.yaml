  Some geometric properties of PD's are established, Kullback's I-divergence playing
  the role of squared Euclidean distance. The minimum discrimination information problem
  is viewed as that of projecting a PD onto a convex set of PD's and useful existence
  theorems for and characterizations of the minimizing PD are arrived at. A natural
  generalization of known iterative algorithms converging to the minimizing PD in
  special situations is given; even for those special cases, our convergence proof
  is more generally valid than those previously published. As corollaries of independent
  interest, generalizations of known results on the existence of PD's or nonnegative
  matrices of a certain form are obtained. The Lagrange multiplier technique is not
  used.
