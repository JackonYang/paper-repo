paperAbstract: We describe METEOR, an automatic metric for machine translation evaluation
  that is based on a generalized concept of unigram matching between the machineproduced
  translation and human-produced reference translations. Unigrams can be matched based
  on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be
  easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized
  unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score
  for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and
  a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered
  the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We
  evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human
  judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between
  its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English
  and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show
  that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on
  the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision,
  unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to
  show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules.
