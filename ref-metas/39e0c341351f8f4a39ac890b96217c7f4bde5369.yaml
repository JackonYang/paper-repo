paperAbstract: Probabilistic generative models can be used for compression, denoising,
  inpainting, texture synthesis, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised feature learning,
  and other tasks. Given this wide range of applications, it is not surprising that
  a lot of heterogeneity exists in the way these models are formulated, trained, and
  evaluated. As a consequence, direct comparison between models is often difficult.
  This article reviews mostly known but often underappreciated properties relating
  to the evaluation and interpretation of generative models with a focus on image
  models. In particular, we show that three of the currently most commonly used criteria---average
  log-likelihood, Parzen window estimates, and visual fidelity of samples---are largely
  independent of each other when the data is high-dimensional. Good performance with
  respect to one criterion therefore need not imply good performance with respect
  to the other criteria. Our results show that extrapolation from one criterion to
  another is not warranted and generative models need to be evaluated directly with
  respect to the application(s) they were intended for. In addition, we provide examples
  demonstrating that Parzen window estimates should generally be avoided.
