paperAbstract: Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands
  of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent
  of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training
  very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes
  these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct
  a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which
  we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual
  networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs)
  and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep
  counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide
  residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual
  networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art
  results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet. Our code
  and models are available at this https URL
