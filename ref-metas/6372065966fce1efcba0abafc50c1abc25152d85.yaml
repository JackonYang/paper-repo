paperAbstract: Text detection in natural images remains a very challenging task. For
  instance, in an urban context, the detection is very difficult due to large variations
  in terms of shape, size, color, orientation, and the image may be blurred or have
  irregular illumination, etc. In this paper, we describe a robust and accurate multiresolution
  approach to detect and classify text regions in such scenarios. Based on generation/validation
  paradigm, we first segment images to detect character regions with a multiresolution
  algorithm able to manage large character size variations. The segmented regions
  are then filtered out using shapebased classification, and neighboring characters
  are merged to generate text hypotheses. A validation step computes a region signature
  based on texture analysis to reject false positives. We evaluate our algorithm in
  two challenging databases, achieving very good results.
