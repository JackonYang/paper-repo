paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a method based on gradient vector flow for
  video character segmentation. By formulating character segmentation as a minimum
  cost path finding problem, the proposed method allows curved segmentation paths
  and thus it is able to segment overlapping characters and touching characters due
  to low contrast and complex background. Gradient vector flow is used in a new way
  to identify candidate cut pixels. A two-pass path finding algorithm is then applied
  where the forward direction helps to locate potential cuts and the backward direction
  serves to remove the false cuts, i.e. those that go through the characters, while
  retaining the true cuts. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
  an existing method on multi-oriented English and Chinese video text lines. The proposed
  method also helps to improve binarization results, which lead to a better character
  recognition rate.
