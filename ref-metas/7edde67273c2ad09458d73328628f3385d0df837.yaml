paperAbstract: In the machine learning community it is generally believed that graph
  Laplacians corresponding to a finite sample of data points converge to a continuous
  Laplace operator if the sample size increases. Even though this assertion serves
  as a justification for many Laplacian-based algorithms, so far only some aspects
  of this claim have been rigorously proved. In this paper we close this gap by establishing
  the strong pointwise consistency of a family of graph Laplacians with data-dependent
  weights to some weighted Laplace operator. Our investigation also includes the important
  case where the data lies on a submanifold of R d .
