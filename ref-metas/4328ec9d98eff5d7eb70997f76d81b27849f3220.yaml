paperAbstract: 'Current high-quality object detection approaches use the scheme of
  salience-based object proposal methods followed by post-classification using deep
  convolutional features. This spurred recent research in improving object proposal
  methods. However, domain agnostic proposal generation has the principal drawback
  that the proposals come unranked or with very weak ranking, making it hard to trade-off
  quality for running time. This raises the more fundamental question of whether high-quality
  proposal generation requires careful engineering or can be derived just from data
  alone. We demonstrate that learning-based proposal methods can effectively match
  the performance of hand-engineered methods while allowing for very efficient runtime-quality
  trade-offs. Using the multi-scale convolutional MultiBox (MSC-MultiBox) approach,
  we substantially advance the state-of-the-art on the ILSVRC 2014 detection challenge
  data set, with $0.5$ mAP for a single model and $0.52$ mAP for an ensemble of two
  models. MSC-Multibox significantly improves the proposal quality over its predecessor
  MultiBox~method: AP increases from $0.42$ to $0.53$ for the ILSVRC detection challenge.
  Finally, we demonstrate improved bounding-box recall compared to Multiscale Combinatorial
  Grouping with less proposals on the Microsoft-COCO data set.'
