paperAbstract: This contribution develops a new technique for content-based image
  retrieval. Where most existing image retrieval systems mainly focus on color and
  color distribution or texture, we classify the images based on local invariants.
  These features represent the image in a very compact way and allow fast comparison
  and feature matching with images in the database. Using local features makes the
  system robust to occlusions and changes in the background. Using invariants makes
  it robust to changes in viewpoint and illumination.
