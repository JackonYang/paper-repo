paperAbstract: We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation
  that the information required to assert a relationship between two named entities
  in the same sentence is typically captured by the shortest path between the two
  entities in the dependency graph. Experiments on extracting top-level relations
  from the ACE (Automated Content Extraction) newspaper corpus show that the new shortest
  path dependency kernel outperforms a recent approach based on dependency tree kernels.
