paperAbstract: A method will be described for finding the shape of a smooth opaque
  object from a monocular image, given a knowledge of the surface photometry, the
  position of the light-source and certain auxiliary information to resolve ambiguities.
  This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching
  up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing
  of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered
  two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order
  non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity
  at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means
  of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out
  by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic
  strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce
  the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around
  so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed
  including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In
  both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra
  follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation
  of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera
  at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition
  program.
