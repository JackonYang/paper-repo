paperAbstract: A model for a large network of "neurons" with a graded response (or
  sigmoid input-output relation) is studied. This deterministic system has collective
  properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based
  on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent
  collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response
  model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is
  given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly
  biological "neurons." Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described
  will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence.
  The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection
  to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of
  action potentials in the graded response system are also developed.
