paperAbstract: "This paper presents a simple and biologically plausible model of how\
  \ mammalian visual systems could detect and identify features in an image. We suggest\
  \ that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as \u2018\
  lines\u2019 and \u2018edges\u2019 are the points where the Fourier components of\
  \ the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points \u2018local energy\u2019\
  \ is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared\
  \ response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing\
  \ in phase spectrum by 90\xB0: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread\
  \ function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main\
  \ contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters,\
  \ whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter\
  \ types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either\
  \ simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images,\
  \ and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization\
  \ of the images."
