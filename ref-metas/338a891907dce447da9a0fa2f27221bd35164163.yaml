paperAbstract: The web contains a wealth of product reviews, but sifting through them
  is a daunting task. Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search
  results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features,
  etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin
  by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically
  distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information
  retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various
  metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods
  work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual
  sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity.
  But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for
  grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful.
