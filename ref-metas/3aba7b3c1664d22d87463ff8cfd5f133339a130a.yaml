paperAbstract: Reliable and accurate fingerprint recognition is a challenging pattern
  recognition problem, requiring algorithms robust in many contexts. FVC2000 competition
  attempted to establish the first common benchmark, allowing companies and academic
  institutions to unambiguously compare performance and track improvements in their
  fingerprint recognition algorithms. Three databases were created using different
  state-of-the-art sensors and a fourth database was artificially generated; 11 algorithms
  were extensively tested on the four data sets. We believe that FVC2000 protocol,
  databases, and results will be useful to all practitioners in the field not only
  as a benchmark for improving methods, but also for enabling an unbiased evaluation
  of algorithms.
