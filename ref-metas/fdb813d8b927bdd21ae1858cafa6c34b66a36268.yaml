paperAbstract: Latent semantic models, such as LSA, intend to map a query to its relevant
  documents at the semantic level where keyword-based matching often fails. In this
  study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure
  that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the
  relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between
  them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained
  by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query
  using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search
  applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively
  scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such
  tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world
  data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent
  semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior
  to the work presented in this paper.
