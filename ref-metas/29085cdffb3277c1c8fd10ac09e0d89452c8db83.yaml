paperAbstract: We introduce a recurrent architecture having a modular structure and
  we formulate a training procedure based on the EM algorithm. The resulting model
  has similarities to hidden Markov models, but supports recurrent networks processing
  style and allows to exploit the supervised learning paradigm while using maximum
  likelihood estimation.
