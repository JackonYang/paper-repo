paperAbstract: 'A computational approach for analyzing visible textures is described.
  Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial
  frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant
  characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency
  and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase)
  are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation,
  or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code,
  or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known
  as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several
  senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable
  center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in
  spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect
  boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses
  allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of
  both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures.
