paperAbstract: Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical
  machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation
  models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length
  representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates
  a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing
  the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder
  and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that
  the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without
  unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence
  and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed
  gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence
  automatically.
