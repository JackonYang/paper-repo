paperAbstract: The advantages of solving the stereo correspondence problem by imposing
  a limit on the magnitude of allowable disparity gradients are examined. It is shown
  how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin
  requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of
  surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described.
  In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms,
  PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides
  with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF
  is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences
  between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving
  the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist
  in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed.
