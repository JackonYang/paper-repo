paperAbstract: Scenic word images undergo degradations due to motion blur, uneven
  illumination, shadows and defocussing, which lead to difficulty in segmentation.
  As a result, the recognition results reported on the scenic word image datasets
  of ICDAR have been low. We introduce a novel technique, where we choose the middle
  row of the image as a sub-image and segment it first. Then, the labels from this
  segmented sub-image are used to propagate labels to other pixels in the image. This
  approach, which is unique and distinct from the existing methods, results in improved
  segmentation. Bayesian classification and Max-flow methods have been independently
  used for label propagation. This midline based approach limits the impact of degradations
  that happens to the image. The segmented text image is recognized using the trial
  version of Omnipage OCR. We have tested our method on ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2011
  datasets. Our word recognition results of 64.5% and 71.6% are better than those
  of methods in the literature and also methods that competed in the Robust reading
  competition. Our method makes an implicit assumption that degradation is not present
  in the middle row.
