paperAbstract: 'The problem of scale in shape from texture is addressed. The need
  for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount
  of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive
  texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the
  size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is
  accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms
  of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in
  scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions
  about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions,
  weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments
  on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability
  of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>'
