paperAbstract: An improved shipping container having novel locking features in the
  end panel and corner flaps. The novel locking features improved bulge resistance
  at the end panels from sideward bulge of the product. The improved container comprises
  a pair of corner flaps being hinged from the side panels and folded inwardly against
  an end panel with the two corner flaps and end panel on each side of the container
  having a quadruple lock. The lock is formed by providing a locking tab on each corner
  flap as well as a pair of locking tabs on the end panel with the end panel and corner
  flaps locking tabs being designed to be swung and locked in the opening formed by
  the aligned mating locking tab.
