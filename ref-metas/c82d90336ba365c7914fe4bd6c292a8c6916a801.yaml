paperAbstract: Indoor scene recognition is a challenging open problem in high level
  vision. Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform
  poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes
  (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others
  (e.g, bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally,
  to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit
  local and global discriminative information. In this paper we propose a prototype
  based model that can successfully combine both sources of information. To test our
  approach we created a dataset of 67 indoor scenes categories (the largest available)
  covering a wide range of domains. The results show that our approach can significantly
  outperform a state of the art classifier for the task.
