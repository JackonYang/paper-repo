paperAbstract: Scene text recognition (STR) is the recognition of text anywhere in
  the environment, such as signs and storefronts. Relative to document recognition,
  it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled
  conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored
  or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as
  useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different
  labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather
  than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons
  improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic
  model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision.
  Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for
  shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses.
  By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that
  result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing
  text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character
  recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35
  percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9
  percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy.
