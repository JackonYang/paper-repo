paperAbstract: "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities\
  \ to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element\
  \ for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand\
  \ and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the\
  \ structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type\
  \ of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations.\
  \ Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing\
  \ elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different\
  \ entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not\
  \ lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional\
  \ computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing\
  \ abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational\
  \ scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception.\
  \ Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization\
  \ arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations.\
  \ Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary\
  \ associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for\
  \ distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses\
  \ match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the\
  \ System Development Foundation. I thank Jim Anderson, Dave Ackley Dana Ballard,\
  \ Francis Crick, Scott Fahlman, Jerry Feldman, Christopher Longuet-Higgins, Don\
  \ Norman, Terry Sejnowski, and Tim Shallice for helpful discussions. Jay McClelland\
  \ and Dave Rumelhart helped me refine and rewrite many of the ideas presented here\
  \ A substantially revised version of this report will appear as a chapter by Hinton,\
  \ McClelland and Rumelhart in Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the\
  \ micro-structure of cognition, edited by McClelland and Rumelhart)"
