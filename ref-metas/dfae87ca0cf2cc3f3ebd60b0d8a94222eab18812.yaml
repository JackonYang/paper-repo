paperAbstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can be used in automatic speech recognition
  in many ways. A particular application of this tool over the last few years has
  been the Tandem approach, as described in [7] and other more recent publications.
  Here we discuss the characteristics of the MLP-based features used for the Tandem
  approach, and conclude with a report on their application to conversational speech
  recognition. The paper shows that MLP transformations yield variables that have
  regular distributions, which can be further modified by using logarithm to make
  the distribution easier to model by a Gaussian-HMM. Two or more vectors of these
  features can easily be combined without increasing the feature dimension. We also
  report recognition results that show that MLP features can significantly improve
  recognition performance for the NIST 2001 Hub-5 evaluation set with models trained
  on the Switchboard Corpus, even for complex systems incorporating MMIE training
  and other enhancements.
