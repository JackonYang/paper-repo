paperAbstract: "Attention mechanisms in biological perception are thought to select\
  \ subsets of perceptual information for more sophisticated processing which would\
  \ be prohibitive to perform on all sensory inputs. In computer vision, however,\
  \ there has been relatively little exploration of hard attention, where some information\
  \ is selectively ignored, in spite of the success of soft attention, where information\
  \ is re-weighted and aggregated, but never filtered out. Here, we introduce a new\
  \ approach for hard attention and find it achieves very competitive performance\
  \ on a recently-released visual question answering datasets, equalling and in some\
  \ cases surpassing similar soft attention architectures while entirely ignoring\
  \ some features. Even though the hard attention mechanism is thought to be non-differentiable,\
  \ we found that the feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provide\
  \ a useful signal for our mechanism\u2019s attentional selection criterion. Because\
  \ hard attention selects important features of the input information, it can also\
  \ be more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially\
  \ important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby\
  \ computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of features."
