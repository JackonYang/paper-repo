paperAbstract: A new method of locating partially visible two-dimensional objects
  is presented. The method is used to locate complex industrial parts that may contain
  several occurrences of local features, such as holes and corners. The matching process
  utilizes clusters of mutually consistent features to hypothesize objects and also
  uses templates of objects to verify these hypotheses. The technique is fast because
  it concentrates on key features that are automatically se lected on the basis of
  a detailed analysis of computer- aided design (CAD) models of the objects. The automatic
  analysis applies general-purpose routines for building and analyzing representations
  of clusters of local features that could be used in procedures to select features
  for other lo cational strategies. These routines include algorithms for computing
  the rotational and mirror symmetries of objects in terms of their local features.
