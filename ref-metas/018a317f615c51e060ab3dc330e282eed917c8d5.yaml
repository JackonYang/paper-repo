paperAbstract: 'Existing methods for grouping edges on the basis of local smoothness
  measures fail to compute complete contours in natural images: it appears that a
  stronger global constraint is required. Motivated by growing evidence that the human
  visual system exploits contour closure for the purposes of perceptual grouping [6,
  7, 14, 15, 25], we present an algorithm for computing highly closed bounding contours
  from images. Unlike previous algorithms [11, 18, 26], no restrictions are placed
  on the type of structure bounded or its shape. Contours are represented locally
  by tangent vectors, augmented by image intensity estimates. A Bayesian model is
  developed for the likelihood that two tangent vectors form contiguous components
  of the same contour. Based on this model, a sparsely-connected graph is constructed,
  and the problem of computing closed contours is posed as the computation of shortest-path
  cycles in this graph. We show that simple tangent cycles can be efficiently computed
  in natural images containing many local ambiguities, and that these cycles generally
  correspond to bounding contours in the image. These closure computations can potentially
  complement region-grouping methods by extending the class of structures segmented
  to include heterogeneous structures.'
