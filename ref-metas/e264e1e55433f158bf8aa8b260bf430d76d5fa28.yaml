paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a novel image representation that renders
  it possible to access natural scenes by local semantic description. Our work is
  motivated by the continuing effort in content-based image retrieval to extract and
  to model the semantic content of images. The basic idea of the semantic modeling
  is to classify local image regions into semantic concept classes such as water,
  rocks, or foliage. Images are represented through the frequency of occurrence of
  these local concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the image
  representation is well suited for modeling the semantic content of heterogenous
  scene categories, and thus for categorization and retrieval.The image representation
  also allows us to rank natural scenes according to their semantic similarity relative
  to certain scene categories. Based on human ranking data, we learn a perceptually
  plausible distance measure that leads to a high correlation between the human and
  the automatically obtained typicality ranking. This result is especially valuable
  for content-based image retrieval where the goal is to present retrieval results
  in descending semantic similarity from the query.
