paperAbstract: The state of the art in visual object retrieval from large databases
  is achieved by systems that are inspired by text retrieval. A key component of these
  approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional
  descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete
  vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted
  set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization
  stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words
  based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may
  be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification
  is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard
  Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results
  exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly
  on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer.
  Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large
  vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index.
