paperAbstract: The authors examine the problem of locating and extracting text from
  images on the World Wide Web. They describe a text detection algorithm which is
  based on color clustering and connected component analysis. The algorithm first
  quantizes the color space of the input image into a number of color classes using
  a parameter-free clustering procedure. It then identifies text-like connected components
  in each color class based on their shapes. Finally, a post-processing procedure
  aligns text-like components into text lines. Experimental results suggest this approach
  is promising despite the challenging nature of the input data.
