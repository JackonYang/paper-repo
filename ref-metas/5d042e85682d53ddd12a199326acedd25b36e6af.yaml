paperAbstract: A warning device associated with a rotatable body comprising means
  on the rotatable body for creating a magnetic field, a receiving coil on a relatively
  stationary member arranged such that upon rotation of the rotatable body interaction
  with the magnetic field causes electrical pulses to be generated in the receiving
  coil and an electronic switching circuit operated by the pulses such that a warning
  is given upon occurrence of a predetermined condition, such as pressure of a vehicle
  wheel deviating outside a predetermined limit.
