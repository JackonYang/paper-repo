paperAbstract: "It seems widely agreed that IE (Information Extraction) is now a tested\
  \ language technology that has reached precision+recall values that put it in about\
  \ the same position as Information Retrieval and Machine Translation, both of which\
  \ are widely used commercially. There is also a clear range of practical applications\
  \ that would be eased by the sort of template-style data that IE provides. The problem\
  \ for wider deployment of the technology is adaptability: the ability to customize\
  \ IE rapidly to new domains. In this paper we discuss some methods that have been\
  \ tried to ease this problem, and to create something more rapid than the bench-mark\
  \ one-month figure, which was roughly what ARPA teams in IE needed to adapt an existing\
  \ system by hand to a new domain of corpora and templates. An important distinction\
  \ in discussing the issue is the degree to which a user can be assumed to know what\
  \ is wanted, to have preexisting templates ready to hand, as opposed to a user who\
  \ has a vague idea of what is needed from a corpus. We shall discuss attempts to\
  \ derive templates directly from corpora; to derive knowledge structures and lexicons\
  \ directly from corpora, including discussion of the recent LE project ECRAN which\
  \ attempted to tune existing lexicons to new corpora. An important issue is how\
  \ far established methods in Information Retrieval of tuning to a user\u2019s needs\
  \ with feedback at an interface can be transferred to IE."
