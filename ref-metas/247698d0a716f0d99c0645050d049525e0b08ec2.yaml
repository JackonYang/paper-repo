paperAbstract: "Abst ract . Learning in layered neu ral networks is posed as the mini\xAD\
  \ miz at ion of an error function defined over t he training set. A proba\xAD bilistic\
  \ interpretation of the target act ivities sugges ts th e use of rela\xAD t ive\
  \ entro py as an error measure. We investigate t he merits of using this error function\
  \ over t he traditional quad ratic function for gradient descent learni ng. Com\
  \ parative numerical sim ulations for the conrf\xAD guity problem show marked redu\
  \ ct ion s in learn ing t imes. This im \xAD provement is explained in terms of\
  \ the characteristic steepness of the landscape defined by the error function in\
  \ configuration space."
