paperAbstract: 'In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for detecting texts in images
  and video frames. It is performed by three steps: edge detection, text candidate
  detection and text refinement detection. Firstly, it applies edge detection to get
  four edge maps in horizontal, vertical, up-right, and up-left direction. Secondly,
  the feature is extracted from four edge maps to represent the texture property of
  text. Then k-means algorithm is applied to detect the initial text candidates. Finally,
  the text areas are identified by the empirical rules analysis and refined through
  project profile analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
  could efficiently be used as an automatic text detection system, which is robust
  for font size, font color, background complexity and language.'
