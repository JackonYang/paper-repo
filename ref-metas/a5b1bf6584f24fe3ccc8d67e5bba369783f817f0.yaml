paperAbstract: "Speaking using unconstrained natural language is an intuitive and\
  \ flexible way for humans to interact with robots. Understanding this kind of linguistic\
  \ input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures\
  \ that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded\
  \ in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language\
  \ directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic\
  \ input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only\
  \ information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We\
  \ use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The\
  \ first component grounds landmark phrases such as \u201Cthe computers\u201D in\
  \ the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from\
  \ a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component\
  \ judges how well spatial relations such as \u201Cpast the computers\u201D describe\
  \ a path. Finally, verb phrases such as \u201Cturn right\u201D are modeled according\
  \ to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60% of\
  \ the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly\
  \ outperforming other approaches."
