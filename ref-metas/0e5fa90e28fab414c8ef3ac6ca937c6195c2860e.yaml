paperAbstract: Matrix and tensor factorization have been applied to a number of semantic
  relatedness tasks, including paraphrase identification. The key idea is that similarity
  in the latent space implies semantic relatedness. We describe three ways in which
  labeled data can improve the accuracy of these approaches on paraphrase classification.
  First, we design a new discriminative term-weighting metric called TF-KLD, which
  outperforms TF-IDF. Next, we show that using the latent representation from matrix
  factorization as features in a classification algorithm substantially improves accuracy.
  Finally, we combine latent features with fine-grained n-gram overlap features, yielding
  performance that is 3% more accurate than the prior state-of-the-art.
