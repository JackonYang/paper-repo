paperAbstract: This paper introduces the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)
  corpus, a dataset designed for use in the development and evaluation of machine
  learning models for sentence understanding. At 433k examples, this resource is one
  of the largest corpora available for natural language inference (a.k.a. recognizing
  textual entailment), improving upon available resources in both its coverage and
  difficulty. MultiNLI accomplishes this by offering data from ten distinct genres
  of written and spoken English, making it possible to evaluate systems on nearly
  the full complexity of the language, while supplying an explicit setting for evaluating
  cross-genre domain adaptation. In addition, an evaluation using existing machine
  learning models designed for the Stanford NLI corpus shows that it represents a
  substantially more difficult task than does that corpus, despite the two showing
  similar levels of inter-annotator agreement.
