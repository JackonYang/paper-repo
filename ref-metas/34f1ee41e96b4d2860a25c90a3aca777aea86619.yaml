paperAbstract: The task to be solved within our core research was the design and development
  of a document analysis toolbox covering typical document analysis tasks such as
  document understanding, information extraction and text recognition. In order to
  prove the feasibility of our concepts, we have developed the prototypical analysis
  system OfficeMAID (Office Mail Analysis, Interpretation and Delivery). The system
  analyses documents, as used in the daily work of a purchasing department, by a priori
  knowledge about workflows and document features. In this way, the system provides
  goal-directed information extraction, shallow understanding and process identification
  for given documents (paper, fax, e-mail).
