paperAbstract: 'The WorldWideWeb is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Most information
  on the Web is presented in loosely structured natural language text with no agent-readable
  semantics. HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually
  no insight into their content. Thus, the designers of intelligent Web agents need
  to address the following questions: (1) To what extent can an agent understand information
  published at Web sites? (2) Is the agent''s understanding sufficient to provide
  genuinely useful assistance to users? (3) Is site-specific hand-coding necessary,
  or can the agent automatically extract information from unfamiliar Web sites? (4)
  What aspects of the Web facilitate this competence? In this paper we investigate
  these issues with a case study using ShopBot, a fully-implemented, domainindependent
  comparison-shopping agent. Given the home pages of several online stores, ShopBot
  autonomously learns how to shop at those vendors. After learning, it is able to
  speedily visit over a dozen software and CD vendors, extract product information,
  and summarize the results for the user. Preliminary studies show that ShopBot enables
  users to both find superior prices and substantially reduce Web shopping time. Remarkably,
  ShopBot achieves this performance without sophisticated natural language processing,
  and requires only minimal knowledge about different product domains. Instead, ShopBot
  relies on a combination of heuristic search, pattern matching, and inductive learning
  techniques. PERMISSION TO COPY WITHOUT FEE ALL OR OR PART OF THIS MATERIAL IS GRANTED
