paperAbstract: A pattern-oriented segmentation method for optical character recognition
  that leads to document structure analysis is presented. As a first example, segmentation
  of handwritten numerals that touch are treated. Connected pattern components are
  extracted, and spatial interrelations between components are measured and grouped
  into meaningful character patterns. Stroke shapes are analyzed and a method of finding
  the touching positions that separates about 95% of connected numerals correctly
  is described. Ambiguities are handled by multiple hypotheses and verification by
  recognition. An extended form of pattern-oriented segmentation, tabular form recognition,
  is considered. Images of tabular forms are analyzed, and frames in the tabular structure
  are extracted. By identifying semantic relationships between label frames and data
  frames, information on the form can be properly recognized. >
