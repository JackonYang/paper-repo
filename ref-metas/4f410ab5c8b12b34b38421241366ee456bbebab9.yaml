paperAbstract: Most current statistical natural language processing models use only
  local features so as to permit dynamic programming in inference, but this makes
  them unable to fully account for the long distance structure that is prevalent in
  language use. We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte
  Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models.
  By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such
  as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while
  preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based
  information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label
  consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results
  in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established
  information extraction tasks.
