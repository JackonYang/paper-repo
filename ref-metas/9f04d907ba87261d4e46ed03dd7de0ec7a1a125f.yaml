paperAbstract: 'We describe a method for articulated human detection and human pose
  estimation in static images based on a new representation of deformable part models.
  Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and foreshortened)
  templates, we use a mixture of small, nonoriented parts. We describe a general,
  flexible mixture model that jointly captures spatial relations between part locations
  and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard pictorial
  structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable
  properties: 1) They efficiently model articulation by sharing computation across
  similar warps, 2) they efficiently model an exponentially large set of global mixtures
  through composition of local mixtures, and 3) they capture the dependency of global
  geometry on local appearance (parts look different at different locations). When
  relations are tree structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic
  programming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations,
  and co-occurrence relations (which encode local rigidity) with a structured SVM
  solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches
  over scales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose
  estimation and human detection, both separately and jointly. We show that currently
  used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches
  model limbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently
  of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic evaluation that suggests
  that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We
  present experimental results on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is
  the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past work on the challenging
  Parse and Buffy datasets while being orders of magnitude faster.'
