paperAbstract: Inspecting a pattern of alternating dark and light bars makes it difficult
  to see a similar pattern presented afterward. This phenomenon can be used to isolate
  mechanisms responsive to bars of a given width. Our results suggest that the human
  visual system contains several different classes of size detectors, each maximally
  sensitive to visual targets with sizes in a particular range.
