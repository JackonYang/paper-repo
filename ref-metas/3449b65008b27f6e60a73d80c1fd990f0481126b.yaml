paperAbstract: "Torch7 is a versatile numeric computing framework and machine learning\
  \ library that extends Lua. Its goal is to provide a flexible environment to design\
  \ and train learning machines. Flexibility is obtained via Lua, an extremely lightweight\
  \ scripting language. High performance is obtained via efficient OpenMP/SSE and\
  \ CUDA implementations of low-level numeric routines. Torch7 can easily be interfaced\
  \ to third-party software thanks to Lua\u2019s light interface."
