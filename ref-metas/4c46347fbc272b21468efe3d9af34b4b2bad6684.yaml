paperAbstract: We develop a 2nd-order optimization method based on the "Hessian-free"
  approach, and apply it to training deep auto-encoders. Without using pre-training,
  we obtain results superior to those reported by Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006) on
  the same tasks they considered. Our method is practical, easy to use, scales nicely
  to very large datasets, and isn't limited in applicability to auto-encoders, or
  any specific model class. We also discuss the issue of "pathological curvature"
  as a possible explanation for the difficulty of deep-learning and how 2nd-order
  optimization, and our method in particular, effectively deals with it.
