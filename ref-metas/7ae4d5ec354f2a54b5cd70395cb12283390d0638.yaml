paperAbstract: 'State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive
  learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast, non-parametric
  nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require no training time and have
  other favorable properties. However, the large performance gap between these two
  families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that
  the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably
  undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods,
  have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization
  of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii)
  Computation of ''image-to-image'' distance, instead of ''image-to-class'' distance.
  We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor),
  which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not
  in the space of images). NBNN computes direct ''image- to-class'' distances without
  descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption,
  the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN.
  Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training
  phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers.
  Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256
  and Graz-01).'
