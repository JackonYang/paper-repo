paperAbstract: Detecting people in images is a key problem for video indexing, browsing
  and retrieval. The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused
  by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people
  in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts
  (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth
  & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic
  programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial
  structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works
  with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines
  (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work
  using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect
  both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically,
  upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination,
  pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded
  probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate
  their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning
  detectors in more general situations.
