paperAbstract: 'Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a
  finite image region, only a single motion is present. Thissingle motion assumptionis
  violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently
  moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical
  flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework
  based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and
  spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust
  estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow
  problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions.
  The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical
  flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities.
  This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a
  region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples
  with natural and synthetic image sequences.'
