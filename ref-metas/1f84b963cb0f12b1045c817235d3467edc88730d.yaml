paperAbstract: This paper presents an effective and efficient approach to extracting
  captions from videos. The robustness of our system comes from two aspects of contributions.
  First, we propose a novel stroke-like edge detection method based on contours, which
  can effectively remove the interference of non-stroke edges in complex background
  so as to make the detection and localization of captions much more accurate. Second,
  our approach highlights the importance of temporal feature, i.e., inter-frame feature,
  in the task of caption extraction (detection, localization, segmentation). Instead
  of regarding each video frame as an independent image, through fully utilizing the
  temporal feature of video together with spatial analysis in the computation of caption
  localization, segmentation and post-processing, we demonstrate that the use of inter-frame
  information can effectively improve the accuracy of caption localization and caption
  segmentation. In the comprehensive our evaluation experiments, the experimental
  results on two representative datasets have shown the robustness and efficiency
  of our approach.
