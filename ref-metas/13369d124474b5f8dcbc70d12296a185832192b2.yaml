paperAbstract: Learning to recognize or predict sequences using long-term context
  has many applications. However, practical and theoretical problems are found in
  training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which input/output dependencies
  span long intervals. Starting from a mathematical analysis of the problem, we consider
  and compare alternative algorithms and architectures on tasks for which the span
  of the input/output dependencies can be controlled. Results on the new algorithms
  show performance qualitatively superior to that obtained with backpropagation.
