paperAbstract: A complete mathematical treatment is given for describing the topographic
  primal sketch of the underlying gray tone intensity surface of a digital image.
  Each picture element is independently classified and assigned a unique descriptive
  label, invariant under monotonically increasing gray tone transformations from the
  set (peak, pit, ridge, ravine, saddle, flat, and hillside), with hillside having
  subcategories (inflection point, slope, convex hill, concave hill, and saddle hill).
  The topographic classification is based on the first and second directional derivatives
  of the estimated image- intensity surface. A local, facet model, two-dimensional,
  cubic polynomial fit is done to estimate the image-intensity surface. Zero-crossings
  of the first directional derivative are identified as locations of interest in the
  image.
