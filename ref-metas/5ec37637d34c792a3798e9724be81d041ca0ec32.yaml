paperAbstract: "This paper relates to the receptive field properties of neurons in\
  \ the primary visual cortex, i.e. the striate cortex, to current issues in spatial\
  \ visual information processing. Particular attention is given to the fact that\
  \ receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric\
  \ or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described\
  \ by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial\
  \ frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for\
  \ a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave\
  \ gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned\
  \ to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase\
  \ response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\xB0 or 180\xB0\
  . This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs\
  \ as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor\
  \ filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells\
  \ provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is\
  \ unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean\
  \ firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient,\
  \ but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential\
  \ code."
