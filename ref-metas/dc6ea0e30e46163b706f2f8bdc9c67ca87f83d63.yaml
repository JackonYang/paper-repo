paperAbstract: This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object
  detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving
  high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The
  first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image"
  which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The
  second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number
  of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers.
  The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers
  in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded
  while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can
  be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous
  approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to
  contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields
  detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications,
  the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing
  or skin color detection.
