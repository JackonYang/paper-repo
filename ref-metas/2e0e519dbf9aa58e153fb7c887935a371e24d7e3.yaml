paperAbstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate
  processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily
  combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object
  patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial
  configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches
  that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping
  is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through
  pixel-patch interactions and between-pateh competition encoded in the solution space,
  these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally
  optima] partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate
  that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection,
  while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.
