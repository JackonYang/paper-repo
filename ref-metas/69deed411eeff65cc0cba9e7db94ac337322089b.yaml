paperAbstract: The efficiency and robustness of a vision system is often largely determined
  by the quality of the image features available to it. In data mining, one typically
  works with immense volumes of raw data, which demands effective algorithms to explore
  the data space. In analogy to data mining, the space of meaningful features for
  image analysis is also quite vast. Recently, the challenges associated with these
  problem areas have become more tractable through progress made in machine learning
  and concerted research effort in manual feature design by domain experts. In this
  paper, we propose a feature mining paradigm for image classification and examine
  several feature mining strategies. We also derive a principled approach for dealing
  with features with varying computational demands. Our goal is to alleviate the burden
  of manual feature design, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine
  learning. We include an in-depth empirical study on three typical data sets and
  offer theoretical explanations for the performance of various feature mining strategies.
  As a final confirmation of our ideas, we show results of a system, that utilizing
  feature mining strategies matches or outperforms the best reported results on pedestrian
  classification (where considerable effort has been devoted to expert feature design).
