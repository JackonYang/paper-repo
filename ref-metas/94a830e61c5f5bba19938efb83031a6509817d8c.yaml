paperAbstract: 'A real-world object category can be viewed as a characteristic configuration
  of its parts, that are themselves simpler, smaller (sub)categories. Recognition
  of a category can therefore be made easier by detecting its constituent subcategories
  and combing these detection results. Given a set of training images, each labeled
  by an object category contained in it, we present an approach to learning: (1) Taxonomy
  defined by recursive sharing of subcategories by multiple image categories; (2)
  Subcategory relevance as the degree of evidence a subcategory offers for the presence
  of its parent; (3) Likelihood that the image contains a subcategory; and (4) Prior
  that a subcategory occurs. The images are represented as points in a feature space
  spanned by confidences in the occurrences of the subcategories. The subcategory
  relevances are estimated as weights, necessary to rescale the corresponding axes
  of the feature space so that the images with the same label are closer to each other
  than to those with different labels. When a new image is encountered, the learned
  taxonomy, relevances, likelihoods, and priors are used by a linear classifier to
  categorize the image. On the challenging Caltech-256 dataset, the proposed approach
  significantly outperforms the best categorizations reported. This result is significant
  in that it not only demonstrates the advantages of exploiting subcategory taxonomy
  for recognition, but also suggests that a feature space spanned by part properties,
  instead of direct object properties, allows for linear separation of image classes.'
