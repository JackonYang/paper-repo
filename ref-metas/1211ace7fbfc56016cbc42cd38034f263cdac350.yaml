paperAbstract: Recently Augustson and Minker presented a version of the Bierstone
  algorithm for finding the set of cliques of a finite undirected linear graph. Their
  version contains two errors. In this paper the counterexamples to their version
  and the modified version of the Bierstone algorithm are presented.
