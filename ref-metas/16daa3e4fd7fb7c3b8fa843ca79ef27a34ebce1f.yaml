paperAbstract: This paper presents an integrated solution for computer assisted video
  parsing and content-based video retrieval and browsing. The uniqueness and effectiveness
  of this solution lies in its use of video content information provided by a parsing
  process driven by visual feature analysis. More specifically, parsing will temporally
  segment and abstract a video source, based on low-level image analyses; then retrieval
  and browsing of video will be based on key-frames selected during abstraction and
  spatial-temporal variations of visual features, as well as some shot-level semantics
  derived from camera operation and motion analysis. These processes, as well as video
  retrieval and browsing tools, are presented in detail as functions of an integrated
  system. Also, experimental results on automatic key-frame detection are given.
