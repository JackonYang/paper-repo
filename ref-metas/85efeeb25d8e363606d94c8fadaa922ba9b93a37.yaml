paperAbstract: The Hausdorff distance measures the extent to which each point of a
  model set lies near some point of an image set and vice versa. Thus, this distance
  can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are
  superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance
  between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented.
  The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate
  with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff
  distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no
  correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant
  of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other
  feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the
  problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >
