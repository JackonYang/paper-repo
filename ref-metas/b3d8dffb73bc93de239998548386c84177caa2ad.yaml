paperAbstract: 'Abstract: Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained
  natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard
  sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street
  View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out
  the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose
  a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional
  neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief
  implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural
  networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases
  with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring
  in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this
  approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over $96\%$ accuracy
  in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition
  task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving $97.84\%$ accuracy. We also
  evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street
  View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and
  achieve over $90\%$ accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed
  system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text
  from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses
  distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a $99.8\%$ accuracy on
  the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at
  specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable
  to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.'
