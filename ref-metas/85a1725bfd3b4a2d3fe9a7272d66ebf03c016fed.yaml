paperAbstract: The classical solution to the noise removal problem is the Wiener filter,
  which utilizes the second-order statistics of the Fourier decomposition. Subband
  decompositions of natural images have significantly non-Gaussian higher-order point
  statistics; these statistics capture image properties that elude Fourier-based techniques.
  We develop a Bayesian estimator that is a natural extension of the Wiener solution,
  and that exploits these higher-order statistics. The resulting nonlinear estimator
  performs a "coring" operation. We provide a simple model for the subband statistics,
  and use it to develop a semi-blind noise removal algorithm based on a steerable
  wavelet pyramid.
