paperAbstract: We describe a recursive algorithm to compute representations of functions
  with respect to nonorthogonal and possibly overcomplete dictionaries of elementary
  building blocks e.g. affine (wavelet) frames. We propose a modification to the matching
  pursuit algorithm of Mallat and Zhang (1992) that maintains full backward orthogonality
  of the residual (error) at every step and thereby leads to improved convergence.
  We refer to this modified algorithm as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). It is
  shown that all additional computation required for the OMP algorithm may be performed
  recursively.<<ETX>>
