paperAbstract: State-of-the-art methods for human detection and pose estimation require
  many training samples for best performance. While large, manually collected datasets
  exist, the captured variations w.r.t. appearance, shape and pose are often uncontrolled
  thus limiting the overall performance. In order to overcome this limitation we propose
  a new technique to extend an existing training set that allows to explicitly control
  pose and shape variations. For this we build on recent advances in computer graphics
  to generate samples with realistic appearance and background while modifying body
  shape and pose. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of articulated
  human detection and articulated pose estimation. We report close to state of the
  art results on the popular Image Parsing [25] human pose estimation benchmark and
  demonstrate superior performance for articulated human detection. In addition we
  define a new challenge of combined articulated human detection and pose estimation
  in real-world scenes.
