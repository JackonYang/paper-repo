paperAbstract: This paper describes a methodology to interpret the information from
  telephone company DSX assignment table drawings. Horizontal lines are found using
  an efficient algorithm that works over the run-length encoded representation of
  the image. For vertical lines, the image is transposed using an efficient method
  we developed, and the algorithm for horizontal lines is applied again. Using the
  information about the lines, the tabular structures are extracted by finding biconnected
  components on the graph formed by the lines and their intersections. A methodology
  has also been developed for the representation of end access to the entries inside
  the tables.
