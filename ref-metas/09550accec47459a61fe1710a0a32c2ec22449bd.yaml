paperAbstract: The use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis of
  natural language sentences is described. Structure-building actions associated with
  the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering, restructuring, and copying
  of constituents necessary to produce deep-structure representations of the type
  normally obtained from a transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow
  for a powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take advantage
  of semantic information to guide the parsing. The advantages of this model for natural
  language analysis are discussed in detail and illustrated by examples. An implementation
  of an experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly described.
