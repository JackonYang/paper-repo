paperAbstract: In this work we present discriminative random fields (DRFs), a discriminative
  framework for the classification of image regions by incorporating neighborhood
  interactions in the labels as well as the observed data. The discriminative random
  fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF)
  framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence
  of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This
  assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second,
  the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative
  models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all
  the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data
  unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately
  from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF
  framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken
  from the Corel database.
