paperAbstract: Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video representation
  for action recognition and achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets.
  This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct
  them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF
  descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches
  are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in
  general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve
  the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the
  estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use
  this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly
  improves motion-based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on
  four challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50)
  significantly outperform the current state of the art.
