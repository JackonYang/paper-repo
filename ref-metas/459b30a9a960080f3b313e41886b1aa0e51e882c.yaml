paperAbstract: We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems.
  Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states
  of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy
  function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the
  Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also
  determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
  mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of
  the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations,
  and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with
  a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution
  defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the
  physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same
  thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation
  under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate
  of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation''
  algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm
  and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained
  at low signal-to-noise ratios.
