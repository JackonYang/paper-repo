paperAbstract: 'This paper considers statistical parsing of Czech, which differs radically
  from English in at least two respects: (1) it is a highly inflected language, and
  (2) it has relatively free word order. These differences are likely to pose new
  problems for techniques that have been developed on English. We describe our experience
  in building on the parsing model of (Collins 97). Our final results- 80% dependency
  accuracy - represent good progress towards the 91% accuracy of the parser on English
  (Wall Street Journal) text.'
