paperAbstract: The authors consider the problem of robustly estimating optical flow
  from a pair of images using a new framework based on robust estimation which addresses
  violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions. They
  also show the relationship between the robust estimation framework and line-process
  approaches for coping with spatial discontinuities. In doing so, the notion of a
  line process is generalized to that of an outlier process that can account for violations
  in both the brightness and smoothness assumptions. A graduated non-convexity algorithm
  is presented for recovering optical flow and motion discontinuities. The performance
  of the robust formulation is demonstrated on both synthetic data and natural images.<<ETX>>
