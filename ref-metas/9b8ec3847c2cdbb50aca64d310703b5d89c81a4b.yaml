paperAbstract: A framework of four-layer recognition processes is proposed for understanding
  documents, and a knowledge representation method adaptable to the understanding
  of table-form documents is addressed. Although Y. Nakano et al. (1986) looked upon
  the recognition of multi-kinds of table-form documents as an important subject from
  a practical point of view, they could not report any successful approach because
  their knowledge was based only on the physical coordinate data. In the approach
  presented, this recognition issue was solved, using both the classification tree
  based on the physical characteristics and the structure description tree based on
  the logical characteristics. At least, it is not so difficult to classify various
  kinds of documents into appropriate document classes since table-form documents
  are well designed on the basis of vertical and horizontal line segments. However,
  it is not easy in the case of the other documents because the geometric and spatial
  characteristics of documents are not well specified. It is necessary to investigate
  the application techniques for the other documents from the viewpoint of the knowledge
  representation.<<ETX>>
