paperAbstract: Mutual Boosting is a method aimed at incorporating contextual information
  to augment object detection. When multiple detectors of objects and parts are trained
  in parallel using AdaBoost [1], object detectors might use the remaining intermediate
  detectors to enrich the weak learner set. This method generalizes the efficient
  features suggested by Viola and Jones [2] thus enabling information inference between
  parts and objects in a compositional hierarchy. In our experiments eye-, nose-,
  mouth- and face detectors are trained using the Mutual Boosting framework. Results
  show that the method outperforms applications overlooking contextual information.
  We suggest that achieving contextual integration is a step toward human-like detection
  capabilities.
