paperAbstract: In 1964 the author proposed as an explication of {\em a priori} probability
  the probability measure induced on output strings by a universal Turing machine
  with unidirectional output tape and a randomly coded unidirectional input tape.
  Levin has shown that if tilde{P}'_{M}(x) is an unnormalized form of this measure,
  and P(x) is any computable probability measure on strings, x , then \tilde{P}'_{M}\geqCP(x)
  where C is a constant independent of x . The corresponding result for the normalized
  form of this measure, P'_{M} , is directly derivable from Willis' probability measures
  on nonuniversal machines. If the conditional probabilities of P'_{M} are used to
  approximate those of P , then the expected value of the total squared error in these
  conditional probabilities is bounded by -(1/2) \ln C . With this error criterion,
  and when used as the basis of a universal gambling scheme, P'_{M} is superior to
  Cover's measure b\ast . When H\ast\equiv -\log_{2} P'_{M} is used to define the
  entropy of a rmite sequence, the equation H\ast(x,y)= H\ast(x)+H^{\ast}_{x}(y) holds
  exactly, in contrast to Chaitin's entropy definition, which has a nonvanishing error
  term in this equation.
