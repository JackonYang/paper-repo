paperAbstract: Three Bayesian ideas are presented for supervised adaptive classifiers.
  First, it is argued that the output of a classifier should be obtained by marginalizing
  over the posterior distribution of the parameters; a simple approximation to this
  integral is proposed and demonstrated. This involves a "moderation" of the most
  probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated
  that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models
  in MacKay (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework
  successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found
  using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection
  criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework.
