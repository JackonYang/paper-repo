paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new general framework for the recognition of complex
  visual scenes, which is motivated by biology: We describe a hierarchical system
  that closely follows the organization of visual cortex and builds an increasingly
  complex and invariant feature representation by alternating between a template matching
  and a maximum pooling operation. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on
  a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter
  to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that
  rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given
  the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs
  surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples
  and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal,
  redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object
  categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this
  approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object
  recognition in cortex'
