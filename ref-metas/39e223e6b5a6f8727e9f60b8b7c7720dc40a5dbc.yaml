paperAbstract: In applications such as social, energy, transportation, sensor, and
  neuronal networks, high-dimensional data naturally reside on the vertices of weighted
  graphs. The emerging field of signal processing on graphs merges algebraic and spectral
  graph theoretic concepts with computational harmonic analysis to process such signals
  on graphs. In this tutorial overview, we outline the main challenges of the area,
  discuss different ways to define graph spectral domains, which are the analogs to
  the classical frequency domain, and highlight the importance of incorporating the
  irregular structures of graph data domains when processing signals on graphs. We
  then review methods to generalize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation,
  modulation, dilation, and downsampling to the graph setting and survey the localized,
  multiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract information
  from high-dimensional data on graphs. We conclude with a brief discussion of open
  issues and possible extensions.
