paperAbstract: Deep Belief Networks (DBN's) are generative models that contain many
  layers of hidden variables. Efficient greedy algorithms for learning and approximate
  inference have allowed these models to be applied successfully in many application
  domains. The main building block of a DBN is a bipartite undirected graphical model
  called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Due to the presence of the partition
  function, model selection, complexity control, and exact maximum likelihood learning
  in RBM's are intractable. We show that Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) can be
  used to efficiently estimate the partition function of an RBM, and we present a
  novel AIS scheme for comparing RBM's with different architectures. We further show
  how an AIS estimator, along with approximate inference, can be used to estimate
  a lower bound on the log-probability that a DBN model with multiple hidden layers
  assigns to the test data. This is, to our knowledge, the first step towards obtaining
  quantitative results that would allow us to directly assess the performance of Deep
  Belief Networks as generative models of data.
