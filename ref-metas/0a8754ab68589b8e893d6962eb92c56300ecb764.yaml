paperAbstract: The paper presents a general robust OCR system designed for practical
  use and suited to unconstrained gray-level images grabbed from a CCD camera. The
  system works with minimum assumptions on font, text location, size, color and the
  background scene. The text blocks localization in complex scenes using a specific
  filter which enhances any text from the background without binarization. A special
  stage is designed to separate characters, even touched by using gray-level information.
  The authors also extract gray-level features which make the algorithm more reliable,
  in particular under poor printing conditions or bad contrast digitization.
