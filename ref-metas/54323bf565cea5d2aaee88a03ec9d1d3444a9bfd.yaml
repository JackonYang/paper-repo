paperAbstract: The problem of estimating the parameters which determine a mixture
  density has been the subject of a large, diverse body of literature spanning nearly
  ninety years. During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has
  become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the
  advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of
  the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation
  for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular
  iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for
  mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization
  to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate
  maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation
  and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities,
  focussing in particular on ...
