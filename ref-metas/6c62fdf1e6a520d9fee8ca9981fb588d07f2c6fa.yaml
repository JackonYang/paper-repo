paperAbstract: Minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs have emerged as an increasingly
  useful tool for exactor approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The
  combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms
  with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however,
  has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of
  this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max
  flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several
  standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed.
  The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods
  and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these
  algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo,
  and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than
  any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation
  of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.
