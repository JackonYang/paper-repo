paperAbstract: Automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is
  an active research field in computer vision, computer graphics and computational
  geometry. It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena
  and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture
  inducstries. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research,
  limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general
  topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquers this problem by
  changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric so that
  the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints.
  The computational algorithms are based on Ricci flow and nonlinear heat diffusion
  methods. The approach is general and robust. We employ our algorithm to study the
  constrained surface registration problem which applies to both computer vision and
  medical imaging applications. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing
  the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic and achieve relatively
  high performance when evaluated with some popular surface registration evaluation
  standards.
