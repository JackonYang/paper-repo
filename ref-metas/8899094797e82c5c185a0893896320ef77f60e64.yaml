paperAbstract: Both convolutional and recurrent operations are building blocks that
  process one local neighborhood at a time. In this paper, we present non-local operations
  as a generic family of building blocks for capturing long-range dependencies. Inspired
  by the classical non-local means method [4] in computer vision, our non-local operation
  computes the response at a position as a weighted sum of the features at all positions.
  This building block can be plugged into many computer vision architectures. On the
  task of video classification, even without any bells and whistles, our nonlocal
  models can compete or outperform current competition winners on both Kinetics and
  Charades datasets. In static image recognition, our non-local models improve object
  detection/segmentation and pose estimation on the COCO suite of tasks. Code will
  be made available.
