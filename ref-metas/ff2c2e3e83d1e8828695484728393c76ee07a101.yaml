paperAbstract: The fundamental principles, basic mechanisms, and formal analyses involved
  in the development of parallel distributed processing (PDP) systems are presented
  in individual chapters contributed by leading experts. Topics examined include distributed
  representations, PDP models and general issues in cognitive science, feature discovery
  by competitive learning, the foundations of harmony theory, learning and relearning
  in Boltzmann machines, and learning internal representations by error propagation.
  Consideration is given to linear algebra in PDP, the logic of additive functions,
  resource requirements of standard and programmable nets, and the P3 parallel-network
  simulating system.
