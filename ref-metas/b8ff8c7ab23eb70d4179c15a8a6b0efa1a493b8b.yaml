paperAbstract: 'The problems of heuristic programming-of making computers solve really
  difficult problems-are divided into five main areas: Search, Pattern-Recognition,
  Learning, Planning, and Induction. A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is
  told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may
  program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts.
  Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition
  techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of
  the machine''s methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with
  Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience,
  further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we
  may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller,
  more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will
  need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction.
  Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature
  and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving)
  programs constructed to date.'
