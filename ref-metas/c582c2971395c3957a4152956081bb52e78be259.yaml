paperAbstract: "This paper presents an improved zone content classification method.\
  \ Motivated by our novel background-analysis-based table identification research,\
  \ we added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published\
  \ method [7]. The new features are the total area of large horizontal and large\
  \ vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the zone. A binary decision\
  \ tree is used to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. The training\
  \ and testing data sets for the algorithm include images drawn from the UWCDROM-III\
  \ document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific\
  \ and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, text classes (of font\
  \ size pt and font size pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and\
  \ others. The improved zone classification method raised the accuracy rate to from\
  \ and reduced the median false alarm rate to from . 1 Problem Statement Let ! be\
  \ a set of zone entities. Let \" be a set of content labels, such as text, table,\
  \ math, etc. The function #%$&!(')\" associates each element of * with a label.\
  \ The function +,$-!.'0/ specifies measurements made on each element of ! , where\
  \ / is the measurement space. The zone content classification problem can be formulated\
  \ as follows: Given a zone set ! and a content label set \" , find a classification\
  \ function #1$2!3'4\" , that has the maximum probability: 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98\
  \ 8 (1) In our current approach, we assume conditional independence between the\
  \ zone classifications, so the probability in Equation 1 may be decomposed as 576\
  \ # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8= @ A B 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 (2) The problem can be solved\
  \ by maximizing each individual probability 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 in Equation\
  \ 2, where CFE ! . In our zone content classification experiment, the elements in\
  \ set ! are zone groundtruth entities from UWCDROM III document image database [6].\
  \ The elements of set \" are text with font size GIH J pt, text with font size KLH\
  \ M pt, math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. + 6DC 8 is\
  \ a feature vector generated for C , where CNE ! . We used a decision tree classifier\
  \ to compute the probability in Equation 2 and make the assignment. 2 Related Work\
  \ and Paper Organization A complete document image understanding system can transform\
  \ paper documents into a hierarchical representation of their structure and content.\
  \ The transformed document representation enables document interchange, editing,\
  \ browsing, indexing, filing and retrieval. The zone classification technique plays\
  \ the key role in the success of such a document understanding system. Not only\
  \ is it useful for successive applications such as OCR, table understanding, etc,\
  \ but it can be used to assist and validate document segmentation. In the literature,\
  \ Sivaramakrishnan et. al [7] extracted features for each zone such as run length\
  \ mean and variance, spatial mean and variance, fraction of the total number of\
  \ black pixels in the zone, and the zone width ratio for each zone. They used the\
  \ decision tree classifier to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector.\
  \ They did their experiments on MPO M document images from UWCDROM I image database.\
  \ Liang et. al [5] developed a feature based zone classifier using only the knowledge\
  \ of the widths and the heights of the connected components within a given zone.\
  \ Le et. al [4] proposed an automated labeling of zones from scanned images with\
  \ labels such as titles, authors, affiliations and abstracts. The labeling is based\
  \ on features calculated from optical character recognition(OCR) output, neural\
  \ network models, machine learning methods, and a set of rules that is derived from\
  \ an analysis of the page layout for each journal and from generic typesetting knowledge\
  \ for English text. We developed a novel background-analysis-based table identification\
  \ technique. We repeated Sivaramakrishnan et. al\u2019s work [7] on a larger database\
  \ with a goal to improve its performance on table zone classification. Although\
  \ some background analysis techniques can be found in the literature([1],[2]), none\
  \ of them, to our knowledge, has been used in the table identification problem.\
  \ We added two new features: the total area of large horizontal and vertical blank\
  \ blocks and the number of text glyphs in the given zone, to the original feature\
  \ vector. We improved the accuracy rate and reduced the false alarm rates for most\
  \ of the nine classes. The rest of this paper is divided into Q sections. section\
  \ 3 gives the definitions of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks. The\
  \ two new features are described in section 4. A brief introduction to the decision\
  \ tree classifier is given in section 5. The experimental results are reported in\
  \ section 6. Our conclusion and statement of future work are discussed in section\
  \ 7."
