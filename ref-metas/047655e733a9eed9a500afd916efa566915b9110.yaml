paperAbstract: The temporal distance between events conveys information essential
  for numerous sequential tasks such as motor control and rhythm detection. While
  Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks
  (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on Long Short-Term Memory
  (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform other RNNs on tasks involving long
  time lags. We find that LSTM augmented by "peephole connections" from its internal
  cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences
  of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short
  training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant
  also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly
  nonlinear periodic patterns. This makes LSTM a promising approach for tasks that
  require the accurate measurement or generation of time intervals.
