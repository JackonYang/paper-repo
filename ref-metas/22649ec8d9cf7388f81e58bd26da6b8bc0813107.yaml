paperAbstract: The spatial pyramid and its variants have been among the most popular
  and successful models for object recognition. In these models, local visual features
  are coded across elements of a visual vocabulary, and then these codes are pooled
  into histograms at several spatial granularities. We introduce spatially local coding,
  an alternative way to include spatial information in the image model. Instead of
  only coding visual appearance and leaving the spatial coherence to be represented
  by the pooling stage, we include location as part of the coding step. This is a
  more flexible spatial representation as compared to the fixed grids used in the
  spatial pyramid models and we can use a simple, whole-image region during the pooling
  stage. We demonstrate that combining features with multiple levels of spatial locality
  performs better than using just a single level. Our model performs better than all
  previous single-feature methods when tested on the Caltech 101 and 256 object recognition
  datasets.
