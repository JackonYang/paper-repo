paperAbstract: We train a generative convolutional neural network which is able to
  generate images of objects given object type, viewpoint, and color. We train the
  network in a supervised manner on a dataset of rendered 3D chair models. Our experiments
  show that the network does not merely learn all images by heart, but rather finds
  a meaningful representation of a 3D chair model allowing it to assess the similarity
  of different chairs, interpolate between given viewpoints to generate the missing
  ones, or invent new chair styles by interpolating between chairs from the training
  set. We show that the network can be used to find correspondences between different
  chairs from the dataset, outperforming existing approaches on this task.
