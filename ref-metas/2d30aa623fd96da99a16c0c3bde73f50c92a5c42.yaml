paperAbstract: It is difficult to estimate the probability of a word's context because
  of sparse data problems. If appropriate care is taken, we find that it is possible
  to make useful estimates of contextual probabilities that improve performance in
  a spelling correction application. In contrast, less careful estimates are found
  to be useless. Specifically, we will show that the Good-Turing method makes the
  use of contextual information practical for a spelling corrector, while attempts
  to use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or expected likelihood estimator (ELE)
  fail. Spelling correction was selected as an application domain because it is analogous
  to many important recognition applications based on a noisy channel model (such
  as speech recognition), though somewhat simpler and therefore possibly more amenable
  to detailed statistical analysis.
