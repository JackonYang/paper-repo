paperAbstract: Computational modelling of probability has become a major part of automated
  decision support systems. In this book, the principal ideas of probabilistic reasoning
  - known as Bayesian networks - are outlined and their practical implications illustrated.
  The book is intended for MSc students in knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence
  and statistics, and for professionals in decision support systems applications and
  research.
