paperAbstract: 'Sparse coding is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a
  succinct high-level representation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it represents
  each input as a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. Originally
  applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse coding has also been shown to
  be useful for self-taught learning, in which the goal is to solve a supervised classification
  task given access to additional unlabeled data drawn from different classes than
  that in the supervised learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is
  an extension of sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using
  all of the basis functions in all possible shifts. In this paper, we present an
  efficient algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively
  solving two large convex optimization problems: The first, which computes the linear
  coefficients, is an L1-regularized linear least squares problem with potentially
  hundreds of thousands of variables. Existing methods typically use a heuristic to
  select a small subset of the variables to optimize, but we present a way to efficiently
  compute the exact solution. The second, which solves for bases, is a constrained
  linear least squares problem. By optimizing over complex-valued variables in the
  Fourier domain, we reduce the coupling between the different variables, allowing
  the problem to be solved efficiently. We show that SISC''s learned high-level representations
  of speech and music provide useful features for classification tasks within those
  domains. When applied to classification, under certain conditions the learned features
  outperform state of the art spectral and cepstral features.'
