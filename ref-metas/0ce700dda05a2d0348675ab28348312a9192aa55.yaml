paperAbstract: We address the problem of unsupervised image auto-annotation with probabilistic
  latent space models. Unlike most previous works, which build latent space representations
  assuming equal relevance for the text and visual modalities, we propose a new way
  of modeling multi-modal co-occurrences, constraining the definition of the latent
  space to ensure its consistency in semantic terms (words), while retaining the ability
  to jointly model visual information. The concept is implemented by a linked pair
  of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) models. On a 16000-image collection,
  we show with extensive experiments that our approach significantly outperforms previous
  joint models.
