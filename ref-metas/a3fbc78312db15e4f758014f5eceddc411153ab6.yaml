paperAbstract: The uniform-cost algorithm is a special case of the A*-algorithm for
  finding the shortest paths in graphs. In the uniform-cost algorithm, nodes are expanded
  in order of increasing cost. An efficient version of this algorithm is developed
  for integer cost values. Nodes are sorted by storing them at predefined places (bucket
  sort), keeping the overhead low. The algorithm is applied to general distance transformation.
  A constrained distance transform is an operation which calculates at each pixel
  of an image the distance to the nearest pixel of a reference set, distance being
  defined as minimum path length. The uniform-cost algorithm, in the constrained case,
  proves to be the best solution for distance transformation. It is fast, the processing
  time is independent of the complexity of the image, and memory requirements are
  moderate. >
