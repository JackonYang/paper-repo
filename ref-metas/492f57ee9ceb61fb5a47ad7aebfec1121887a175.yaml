paperAbstract: 'Abstract: Graph-structured data appears frequently in domains including
  chemistry, natural language semantics, social networks, and knowledge bases. In
  this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our
  starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009),
  which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques
  and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful
  class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely
  sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate
  the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We
  then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification,
  in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.'
