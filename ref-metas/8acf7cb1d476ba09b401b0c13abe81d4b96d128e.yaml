paperAbstract: In this paper we present an approach to speaker-independent, isolated
  word recognition in which the well-known techniques of vector quantization and hidden
  Markov modeling are combined with a linear predictive coding analysis front end.
  This is done in the framework of a standard statistical pattern recognition model.
  Both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov models need to be trained for the
  vocabulary being recognized. Such training results in a distinct hidden Markov model
  for each word of the vocabulary. Classification consists of computing the probability
  of generating the test word with each word model and choosing the word model that
  gives the highest probability. There are several factors, in both the vector quantizer
  and the hidden Markov modeling, that affect the performance of the overall word
  recognition system, including the size of the vector quantizer, the structure of
  the hidden Markov model, the ways of handling insufficient training data, etc. The
  effects, on recognition accuracy, of many of these factors are discussed in this
  paper. The entire recognizer (training and testing) has been evaluated on a 10-word
  digits vocabulary. For training, a set of 100 talkers spoke each of the digits one
  time. For testing, an independent set of 100 tokens of each of the digits was obtained.
  The overall recognition accuracy was found to be 96.5 percent for the 100-talker
  test set. These results are comparable to those obtained in earlier work, using
  a dynamic time-warping recognition algorithm with multiple templates per digit.
  It is also shown that the computation and storage requirements of the new recognizer
  were an order of magnitude less than that required for a conventional pattern recognition
  system using linear prediction with dynamic time warping.
