paperAbstract: This paper examines statistical techniques for exploiting relevance
  information to weight search terms. These techniques are presented as a natural
  extension of weighting methods using information about the distribution of index
  terms in documents in general. A series of relevance weighting functions is derived
  and is justified by theoretical considerations. In particular, it is shown that
  specific weighted search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of
  retrieval. Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by experimental
  results for test collections.
