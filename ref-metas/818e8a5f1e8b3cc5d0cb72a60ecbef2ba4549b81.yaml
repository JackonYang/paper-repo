paperAbstract: Adjacent simple cells recorded and "isolated" simultaneously from the
  same microelectrode placement were usually tuned to the same orientation and spatial
  frequency. The responses of the members of these "spatial frequency pairs" to drifting
  sine-wave gratings were cross-correlates. Within the middle range of the spatial
  frequency selectivity curves, the responses of the paired cells differed in phase
  by approximately 90 percent. This phase relationship suggests that adjacent simple
  cells tuned to the same spatial frequency and orientation represent paired sine
  and cosine filters in terms of their processing of afferent spatial inputs and truncated
  sine and cosine filters in terms of the output of simple cells.
