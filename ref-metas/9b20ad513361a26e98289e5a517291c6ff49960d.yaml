paperAbstract: 'One approach to invariant object recognition employs a recurrent neural
  network as an associative memory. In the standard depiction of the network''s state
  space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics.
  I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family
  of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea
  is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task
  of filling in missing information, the network develops a continuous attractor that
  models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical view-point,
  the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised learning in terms
  of regression rather than density estimation.'
