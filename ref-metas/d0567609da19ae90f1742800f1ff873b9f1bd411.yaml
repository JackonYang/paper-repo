paperAbstract: Text extraction in video documents, as an important research field
  of content-based information indexing and retrieval, has been developing rapidly
  since 1990s. This has led to much progress in text extraction, performance evaluation,
  and related applications. By reviewing the approaches proposed during the past five
  years, this paper introduces the progress made in this area and discusses promising
  directions for future research.
