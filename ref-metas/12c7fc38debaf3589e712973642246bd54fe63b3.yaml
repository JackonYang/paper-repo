paperAbstract: We approach recognition in the framework of deformable shape matching,
  relying on a new algorithm for finding correspondences between feature points. This
  algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where
  the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur
  point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding
  feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars
  to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences,
  we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting
  in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled
  in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is
  the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets.
  One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging
  dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification
  rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal
  and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces.
