paperAbstract: In this paper, we review most major filtering approaches to texture
  feature extraction and perform a comparative study. Filtering approaches included
  are Laws masks (1980), ring/wedge filters, dyadic Gabor filter banks, wavelet transforms,
  wavelet packets and wavelet frames, quadrature mirror filters, discrete cosine transform,
  eigenfilters, optimized Gabor filters, linear predictors, and optimized finite impulse
  response filters. The features are computed as the local energy of the filter responses.
  The effect of the filtering is highlighted, keeping the local energy function and
  the classification algorithm identical for most approaches. For reference, comparisons
  with two classical nonfiltering approaches, co-occurrence (statistical) and autoregressive
  (model based) features, are given. We present a ranking of the tested approaches
  based on extensive experiments.
