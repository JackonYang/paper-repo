paperAbstract: "In this article, a highly interactive model of association formation,\
  \ storage, and retrieval is described. Items, represented as sets of features, are\
  \ associated by the operation of convolution. The associations are stored by being\
  \ superimposed in a composite memory trace. Retrieval occurs when a cue item is\
  \ correlated with the composite trace. The retrieved items are intrinsically noisy,\
  \ may be ambiguous, and may under certain conditions be systematically distorted\
  \ from their encoded form. A discrete response is selected by matching the retrieved\
  \ item to all of the items in semantic memory. The model yields several new predictions\
  \ about errors in single-trial cued recall that depend on similarity relations among\
  \ the to-be-remembered items, and also about the efficacy of extralist cues. Experiments\
  \ are presented that test these predictions against human recall. The model is then\
  \ applied to several well-known results: prototype abstraction, the A-B A-D paradigm\u2014\
  including the independence of the B and D responses\u2014 and the Osgood transfer\
  \ surface."
