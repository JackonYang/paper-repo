paperAbstract: We present a unified graphical model framework for describing compound
  codes and deriving iterative decoding algorithms. After reviewing a variety of graphical
  models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a
  general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor
  graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm
  is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms
  for various codes, including "turbo decoding" of parallel-concatenated convolutional
  codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code.
  We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel
  description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be
  developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes,
  and low-density parity-check codes.
