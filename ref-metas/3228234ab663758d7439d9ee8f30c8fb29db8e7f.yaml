paperAbstract: We study the problem of generating plausible interpretations of a scene
  from a collection of line segments automatically extracted from a single indoor
  image. We show that we can recognize the three dimensional structure of the interior
  of a building, even in the presence of occluding objects. Several physically valid
  structure hypotheses are proposed by geometric reasoning and verified to find the
  best fitting model to line segments, which is then converted to a full 3D model.
  Our experiments demonstrate that our structure recovery from line segments is comparable
  with methods using full image appearance. Our approach shows how a set of rules
  describing geometric constraints between groups of segments can be used to prune
  scene interpretation hypotheses and to generate the most plausible interpretation.
