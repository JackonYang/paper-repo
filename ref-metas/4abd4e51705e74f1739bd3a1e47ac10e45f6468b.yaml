paperAbstract: Learning an input-output mapping from a set of examples, of the type
  that many neural networks have been constructed to perform, can be regarded as synthesizing
  an approximation of a multidimensional function (that is, solving the problem of
  hypersurface reconstruction). From this point of view, this form of learning is
  closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines
  and regularization theory. A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between
  regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks
  or hyper basis functions. These networks are not only equivalent to generalized
  splines but are also closely related to the classical radial basis functions used
  for interpolation tasks and to several pattern recognition and neural network algorithms.
  They also have an interesting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are synthesized
  and optimally combined during the learning stage.
