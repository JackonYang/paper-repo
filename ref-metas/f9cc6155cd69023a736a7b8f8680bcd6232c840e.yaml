paperAbstract: We describe a novel method for human detection in single images which
  can detect full bodies as well as close-up views in the presence of clutter and
  occlusion. Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection
  is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local
  features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature
  selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost.
  The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same
  initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection,
  (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the
  search space. The results outperform existing human detectors.
