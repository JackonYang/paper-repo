paperAbstract: Progress can be measured and encouraged via standards for comparison
  and evaluation. Though qualitative assessments can be useful in initial stages,
  quantifiable measures of systems under the same conditions are essential for comparing
  results and assessing claims. This paper will address the emerging standards for
  evaluation of spoken language systems.
