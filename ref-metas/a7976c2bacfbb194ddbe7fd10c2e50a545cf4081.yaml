paperAbstract: 'Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture
  for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In
  recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety
  of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding
  the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants.
  In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants
  on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and
  polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task
  were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed
  using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize
  the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx 15$  years of CPU time), which
  makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that
  none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly,
  and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most
  critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually
  independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.'
