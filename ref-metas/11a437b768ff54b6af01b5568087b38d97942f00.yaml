paperAbstract: Measurements of the spatial contrast sensitivity function and orientation
  selectivity of visual neurons in the foveal striate cortex (V1) of primates were
  interpreted within the context of a model of the two-dimensional spatial structure
  of their receptive fields. Estimates of the spatial dimensions of the receptive
  fields along the axis of preferred orientation were derived from the application
  of the model and were compared with estimates of the smallest spatial subunit in
  the dimension orthogonal to the preferred orientation. Some measure of agreement
  was found with corresponding estimates of parameters for psychophysical channels
  in human foveal vision.
