paperAbstract: We present a new approach for tracking roads from satellite images,
  and thereby illustrate a general computational strategy ("active testing") for tracking
  1D structures and other recognition tasks in computer vision. Our approach is related
  to recent work in active vision on "where to look next" and motivated by the "divide-and-conquer"
  strategy of parlour games. We choose "tests" (matched filters for short road segments)
  one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the "true
  hypothesis" (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are
  chosen online based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and
  hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated
  in simple and explicit analytical terms. At each iteration new image data are examined
  and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image
  location to inspect, and so forth. We report experiments using panchromatic SPOT
  satellite imagery with a ground resolution of ten meters.
