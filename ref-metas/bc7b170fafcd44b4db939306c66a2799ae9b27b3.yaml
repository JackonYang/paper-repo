paperAbstract: This paper presents a system for the offline recognition of large vocabulary
  unconstrained handwritten texts. The only assumption made about the data is that
  it is written in English. This allows the application of statistical language models
  in order to improve the performance of our system. Several experiments have been
  performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from
  10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve
  the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate
  is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent
  for multiple writer data). Our approach is described in detail and compared with
  other methods presented in the literature to deal with the same problem. An experimental
  setup to correctly deal with unconstrained text recognition is proposed.
