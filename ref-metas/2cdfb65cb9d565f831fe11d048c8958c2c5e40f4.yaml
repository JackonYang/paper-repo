paperAbstract: The Brodatz Album has become the de facto standard for evaluating texture
  algorithms, with hundreds of studies having been applied to small sets of its images.
  The authors compare two powerful recognition algorithms, principal components analysis
  and multiscale autoregressive models, by evaluating them on a 999-image database
  derived from the entire Brodatz Album. The variety of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous
  images studied is thus nearly an order of magnitude larger than has been compared
  before, giving one snapshot of the state of the art in real-time texture recognition.<<ETX>>
