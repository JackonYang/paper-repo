paperAbstract: Recent work on face identification using continuous density Hidden
  Markov Models (HMMs) has shown that stochastic modelling can be used successfully
  to encode feature information. When frontal images of faces are sampled using top-bottom
  scanning, there is a natural order in which the features appear and this can be
  conveniently modelled using a top-bottom HMM. However, a top-bottom HMM is characterised
  by different parameters, the choice of which has so far been based on subjective
  intuition. This paper presents a set of experimental results in which various HMM
  parameterisations are analysed.<<ETX>>
