paperAbstract: "Abstract Upper bounds are derived for the probability that the sum\
  \ S of n independent random variables exceeds its mean ES by a positive number nt.\
  \ It is assumed that the range of each summand of S is bounded or bounded above.\
  \ The bounds for Pr {S \u2013 ES \u2265 nt} depend only on the endpoints of the\
  \ ranges of the summands and the mean, or the mean and the variance of S. These\
  \ results are then used to obtain analogous inequalities for certain sums of dependent\
  \ random variables such as U statistics and the sum of a random sample without replacement\
  \ from a finite population."
