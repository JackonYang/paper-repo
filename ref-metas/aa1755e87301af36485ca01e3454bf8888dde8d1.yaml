paperAbstract: The goal of this paper is to present a critical survey of existing
  literature on human and machine recognition of faces. Machine recognition of faces
  has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs
  as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images.
  Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing
  requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over
  the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering,
  image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues
  related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities
  have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques
  and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities.
  But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering
  literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies
  using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement
  applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition
  in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview
  of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present
  a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community.
  Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition
  are reviewed. Global transform and feature based methods using statistical, structural
  and neural classifiers are summarized. >
