paperAbstract: Analyzing videos of human activities involves not only recognizing
  actions (typically based on their appearances), but also determining the story/plot
  of the video. The storyline of a video describes causal relationships between actions.
  Beyond recognition of individual actions, discovering causal relationships helps
  to better understand the semantic meaning of the activities. We present an approach
  to learn a visually grounded storyline model of videos directly from weakly labeled
  data. The storyline model is represented as an AND-OR graph, a structure that can
  compactly encode storyline variation across videos. The edges in the AND-OR graph
  correspond to causal relationships which are represented in terms of spatio-temporal
  constraints. We formulate an Integer Programming framework for action recognition
  and storyline extraction using the storyline model and visual groundings learned
  from training data.
