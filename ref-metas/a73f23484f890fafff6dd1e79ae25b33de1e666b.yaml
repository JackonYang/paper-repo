paperAbstract: Describing a video sequence in terms of a small number of coherently
  moving segments is useful for tasks ranging from video compression to event perception.
  A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation
  framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and
  thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore,
  the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture
  model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add
  spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM
  algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this
  algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model
  failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on
  synthetic and real image sequences.
