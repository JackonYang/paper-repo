paperAbstract: 'We propose an algorithm called query by commitee, in which a committee
  of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according
  to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models:
  the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of
  queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information
  gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number
  of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for
  which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases
  with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite
  information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms.'
