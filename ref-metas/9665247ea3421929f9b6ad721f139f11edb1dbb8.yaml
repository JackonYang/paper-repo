paperAbstract: Recurrent neural network is a powerful model that learns temporal patterns
  in sequential data. For a long time, it was believed that recurrent networks are
  difficult to train using simple optimizers, such as stochastic gradient descent,
  due to the so-called vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, we show that learning
  longer term patterns in real data, such as in natural language, is perfectly possible
  using gradient descent. This is achieved by using a slight structural modification
  of the simple recurrent neural network architecture. We encourage some of the hidden
  units to change their state slowly by making part of the recurrent weight matrix
  close to identity, thus forming kind of a longer term memory. We evaluate our model
  in language modeling experiments, where we obtain similar performance to the much
  more complex Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).
