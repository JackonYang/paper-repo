paperAbstract: A new definition of scale-space is suggested, and a class of algorithms
  used to realize a diffusion process is introduced. The diffusion coefficient is
  chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather
  than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated
  at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region
  boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully
  exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number
  of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm
  involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image. >
