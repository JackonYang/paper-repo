paperAbstract: Backpropagation is now the most widely used tool in the field of artificial
  neural networks. At the core of backpropagation is a method for calculating derivatives
  exactly and efficiently in any large system made up of elementary subsystems or
  calculations which are represented by known, differentiable functions; thus, backpropagation
  has many applications which do not involve neural networks as such. This paper first
  reviews basic backpropagation, a simple method which is now being widely used in
  areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. Next, it presents the basic
  equations for backpropagation through time, and discusses applications to areas
  like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and
  control. Finally, i t describes further extensions of this method, to deal with
  systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations or
  true recurrent networks, and other practical issues which arise with this method.
  Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule for ordered derivatives-the
  theorem which underlies backpropagation-is briefly discussed.
