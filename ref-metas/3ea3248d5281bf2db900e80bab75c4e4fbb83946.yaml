paperAbstract: 'We propose an automatic system for annotating accurately data tables
  extracted from the web. This system is designed to provide additional data to an
  existing querying system called MIEL, which relies on a common vocabulary used to
  query local relational databases. We will use the same vocabulary, translated into
  an OWL ontology, to annotate the tables. Our annotation system is unsupervised.
  It uses only the knowledge defined in the ontology to automatically annotate the
  entire content of tables, using an aggregation approach: first annotate cells, then
  columns, then relations between those columns. The annotations are fuzzy: instead
  of linking an element of the table with a precise concept of the ontology, the elements
  of the table are annotated with several concepts, associated with their relevance
  degree. Our annotation process has been validated experimentally on scientific domains
  (microbial risk in food, chemical risk in food) and a technical domain (aeronautics).'
