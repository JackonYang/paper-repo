paperAbstract: Probabilistic graphical models associate a probability to each configuration
  of the relevant variables. Energy-based models (EBM) associate an energy to those
  configurations, eliminating the need for proper normalization of probability distributions.
  Making a decision (an inference) with an EBM consists in comparing the energies
  associated with various configurations of the variable to be predicted, and choosing
  the one with the smallest energy. Such systems must be trained discriminatively
  to associate low energies to the desired configurations and higher energies to undesired
  configurations. A wide variety of loss function can be used for this purpose. We
  give sufficient conditions that a loss function should satisfy so that its minimization
  will cause the system to approach to desired behavior. We give many specific examples
  of suitable loss functions, and show an application to object recognition in images.
