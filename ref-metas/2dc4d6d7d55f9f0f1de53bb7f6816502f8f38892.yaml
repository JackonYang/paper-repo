paperAbstract: 'We propose a statistical mechanical framework for the modeling of
  discrete time series. Maximum likelihood estimation is done via Boltzmann learning
  in one-dimensional networks with tied weights. We call these networks Boltzmann
  chains and show that they contain hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a special case.
  Our framework also motivates new architectures that address particular shortcomings
  of HMMs. We look at two such architectures: parallel chains that model feature sets
  with disparate time scales, and looped networks that model long-term dependencies
  between hidden states. For these networks, we show how to implement the Boltzmann
  learning rule exactly, in polynomial time, without resort to simulated or mean-field
  annealing. The necessary computations are done by exact decimation procedures from
  statistical mechanics.'
