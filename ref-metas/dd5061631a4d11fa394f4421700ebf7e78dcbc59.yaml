paperAbstract: There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics
  (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at
  a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the
  minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with
  annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very
  large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new
  information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems
  and methods.
