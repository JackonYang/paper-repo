paperAbstract: The problem of finding approximate matches of pieces of shapes to parts
  of larger shapes is investigated. The shapes are represented by polygonal approximations.
  Initially, figures of merit are assigned to the matches between pairs of angles
  on the two shapes. Relaxation methods are then used to find acceptable combinations
  of these matches. This approach was tested on a data base consisting of digitized
  coastlines in various map projections. In nearly all cases, all matches except the
  correct one were eliminated by the relaxation processes.
