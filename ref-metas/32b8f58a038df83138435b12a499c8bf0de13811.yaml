paperAbstract: This paper focuses on the problem of word detection and recognition
  in natural images. The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text
  in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision
  community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image
  word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear
  is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word
  recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first,
  representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of
  text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in
  generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that
  the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition
  has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate
  the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach
  opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances
  that have been taking place in object recognition.
