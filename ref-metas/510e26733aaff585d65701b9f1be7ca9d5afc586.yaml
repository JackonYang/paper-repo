paperAbstract: The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by
  its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are
  active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically
  increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice,
  however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work,
  we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation,
  achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses
  in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated
  Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks.
  A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use
  for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine
  translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities
  of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in
  which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between
  stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks,
  these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower
  computational cost.
