paperAbstract: "This dissertation introduces a new theoretical model for text classification\
  \ systems, including systems for document retrieval, automated indexing, electronic\
  \ mail filtering, and similar tasks. The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role\
  \ of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification.\
  \ It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining\
  \ the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable\
  \ characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce\
  \ indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text\
  \ representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never\
  \ yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning\
  \ model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing\
  \ phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application\
  \ of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties\
  \ while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term\
  \ clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of\
  \ indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic\
  \ indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval\
  \ test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means\
  \ of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces\
  \ a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows\
  \ much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for\
  \ the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective\
  \ and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was\
  \ developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization\
  \ experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about\
  \ properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not\
  \ previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled\
  \ experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer,\
  \ in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was\
  \ found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation.\
  \ New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional\
  \ term clustering methods."
