paperAbstract: 'Office hours: MWF, immediately after class or early afternoon (time
  TBA). We will cover the mathematical foundations of probability theory. The basic
  terminology and concepts of probability theory include: random experiments, sample
  or outcome spaces (discrete and continuous case), events and their algebra, probability
  measures, conditional probability A First Course in Probability (8th ed.) by S.
  Ross. This is a lively text that covers the basic ideas of probability theory including
  those needed in statistics. Theoretical concepts are introduced via interesting
  concrete examples. In 394 I will begin my lectures with the basics of probability
  theory in Chapter 2. However, your first assignment is to review Chapter 1, which
  treats elementary counting methods. They are used in applications in Chapter 2.
  I expect to cover Chapters 2-5 plus portions of 6 and 7. You are encouraged to read
  ahead. In lectures I will not be able to cover every topic and example in Ross,
  and conversely, I may cover some topics/examples in lectures that are not treated
  in Ross. You will be responsible for all material in my lectures, assigned reading,
  and homework, including supplementary handouts if any.'
