paperAbstract: "In addressing the growing problem of junk E-mail on the Internet,\
  \ we examine methods for the automated construction of filters to eliminate such\
  \ unwanted messages from a user\u2019s mail stream. By casting this problem in a\
  \ decision theoretic framework, we are able to make use of probabilistic learning\
  \ methods in conjunction with a notion of differential misclassification cost to\
  \ produce filters Which are especially appropriate for the nuances of this task.\
  \ While this may appear, at first, to be a straight-forward text classification\
  \ problem, we show that by considering domain-specific features of this problem\
  \ in addition to the raw text of E-mail messages, we can produce much more accurate\
  \ filters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in a real world usage scenario,\
  \ arguing that this technology is mature enough for deployment."
