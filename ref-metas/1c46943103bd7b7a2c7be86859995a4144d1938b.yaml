paperAbstract: "We present a new technique called \u201Ct-SNE\u201D that visualizes\
  \ high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional\
  \ map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and\
  \ Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better\
  \ visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center\
  \ of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map\
  \ that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important\
  \ for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional\
  \ manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple\
  \ viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how\
  \ t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure\
  \ of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed.\
  \ We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare\
  \ it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping,\
  \ Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are\
  \ significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all\
  \ of the datasets."
