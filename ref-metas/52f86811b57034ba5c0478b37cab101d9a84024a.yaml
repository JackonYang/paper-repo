paperAbstract: Image description is a new natural language generation task, where
  the aim is to generate a human-like description of an image. The evaluation of computer-generated
  text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions
  has typically been measured using unigram BLEU and human judgements. The focus of
  this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements
  for this task. We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER, ROUGE-SU4,
  and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets. The main finding is that unigram
  BLEU has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human
  judgements.
