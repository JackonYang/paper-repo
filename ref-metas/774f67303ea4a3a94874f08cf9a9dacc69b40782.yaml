paperAbstract: Many object detection systems are constrained by the time required
  to convolve a target image with a bank of filters that code for different aspects
  of an object's appearance, such as the presence of component parts. We exploit locality-sensitive
  hashing to replace the dot-product kernel operator in the convolution with a fixed
  number of hash-table probes that effectively sample all of the filter responses
  in time independent of the size of the filter bank. To show the effectiveness of
  the technique, we apply it to evaluate 100,000 deformable-part models requiring
  over a million (part) filters on multiple scales of a target image in less than
  20 seconds using a single multi-core processor with 20GB of RAM. This represents
  a speed-up of approximately 20,000 times - four orders of magnitude - when compared
  with performing the convolutions explicitly on the same hardware. While mean average
  precision over the full set of 100,000 object classes is around 0.16 due in large
  part to the challenges in gathering training data and collecting ground truth for
  so many classes, we achieve a mAP of at least 0.20 on a third of the classes and
  0.30 or better on about 20% of the classes.
