paperAbstract: "Natural language parsing has typically been done with small sets of\
  \ discrete categories such as NP and VP, but this representation does not capture\
  \ the full syntactic nor semantic richness of linguistic phrases, and attempts to\
  \ improve on this by lexicalizing phrases only partly address the problem at the\
  \ cost of huge feature spaces and sparseness. To address this, we introduce a recursive\
  \ neural network architecture for jointly parsing natural language and learning\
  \ vector space representations for variable-sized inputs. At the core of our architecture\
  \ are context-sensitive recursive neural networks (CRNN). These networks can induce\
  \ distributed feature representations for unseen phrases and provide syntactic information\
  \ to accurately predict phrase structure trees. Most excitingly, the representation\
  \ of each phrase also captures semantic information: For instance, the phrases \u201C\
  decline to comment\u201D and \u201Cwould not disclose the terms\u201D are close\
  \ by in the induced embedding space. Our current system achieves an unlabeled bracketing\
  \ F-measure of 92.1% on the Wall Street Journal dataset for sentences up to length\
  \ 15."
