paperAbstract: We propose a generic method for iteratively approximating various second-order
  gradient steps-Newton, Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, and natural gradient-in
  linear time per iteration, using special curvature matrix-vector products that can
  be computed in O(n). Two recent acceleration techniques for on-line learning, matrix
  momentum and stochastic meta-descent (SMD), implement this approach. Since both
  were originally derived by very different routes, this offers fresh insight into
  their operation, resulting in further improvements to SMD.
