paperAbstract: 'We describe a trainable system for analyzing videos of developing
  C. elegans embryos. The system automatically detects, segments, and locates cells
  and nuclei in microscopic images. The system was designed as the central component
  of a fully automated phenotyping system. The system contains three modules 1) a
  convolutional network trained to classify each pixel into five categories: cell
  wall, cytoplasm, nucleus membrane, nucleus, outside medium; 2) an energy-based model,
  which cleans up the output of the convolutional network by learning local consistency
  constraints that must be satisfied by label images; 3) a set of elastic models of
  the embryo at various stages of development that are matched to the label images.'
