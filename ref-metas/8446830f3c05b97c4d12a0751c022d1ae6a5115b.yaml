paperAbstract: 'The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers,
  but understandable only to humans. The goal of the research described here is to
  automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content
  mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more
  effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support
  knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable
  information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes
  and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions
  of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these
  inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks
  on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning
  algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system.'
