paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe an algorithm for object recognition that
  explicitly models and estimated the posterior probability function, P(object/image).
  We have chosen a functional form of the posterior probability function that captures
  the joint statistics of local appearance and position on the object as well as the
  statistics of local appearance in the visual world at large. We use a discrete representation
  of local appearance consisting of approximately 10/sup 6/ patterns. We compute an
  estimate of P(object/image) in closed form by counting the frequency of occurrence
  of these patterns over various sets of training images. We have used this method
  for detecting human faces from frontal and profile views. The algorithm for frontal
  views has shown a detection rate of 93.0% with 88 false alarms on a set of 125 images
  containing 483 faces combining the MIT test set of Sung and Poggio with the CMU
  test sets of Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade. The algorithm for detection of profile
  views has also demonstrated promising results.
