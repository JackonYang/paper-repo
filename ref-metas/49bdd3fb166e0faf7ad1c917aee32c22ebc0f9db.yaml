paperAbstract: Detection and tracking of humans in video streams is important for
  many applications. We present an approach to automatically detect and track multiple,
  possibly partially occluded humans in a walking or standing pose from a single camera,
  which may be stationary or moving. A human body is represented as an assembly of
  body parts. Part detectors are learned by boosting a number of weak classifiers
  which are based on edgelet features. Responses of part detectors are combined to
  form a joint likelihood model that includes an analysis of possible occlusions.
  The combined detection responses and the part detection responses provide the observations
  used for tracking. Trajectory initialization and termination are both automatic
  and rely on the confidences computed from the detection responses. An object is
  tracked by data association and meanshift methods. Our system can track humans with
  both inter-object and scene occlusions with static or non-static backgrounds. Evaluation
  results on a number of images and videos and comparisons with some previous methods
  are given.
