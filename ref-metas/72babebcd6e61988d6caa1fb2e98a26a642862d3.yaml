paperAbstract: Spreadsheet software are very popular data management tools. Their
  ease of use and abundant functionalities equip novices and professionals alike with
  the means to generate, transform, analyze, and visualize data. As a result, spreadsheets
  are a great resource of factual and structured information. This accentuates the
  need to automatically understand and extract their contents. In this paper, we present
  a novel approach for recognizing tables in spreadsheets. Having inferred the layout
  role of the individual cells, we build layout regions. We encode the spatial interrelations
  between these regions using a graph representation. Based on this, we propose Remove
  and Conquer (RAC), an algorithm for table recognition that implements a list of
  carefully curated rules. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that our approach
  is viable. We achieve significant accuracy in a dataset of real spreadsheets from
  various domains.
