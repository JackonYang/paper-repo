paperAbstract: A novel variant of the familiar backpropagation-through-time approach
  to training recurrent networks is described. This algorithm is intended to be used
  on arbitrary recurrent networks that run continually without ever being reset to
  an initial state, and it is specifically designed for computationally efficient
  computer implementation. This algorithm can be viewed as a cross between epochwise
  backpropagation through time, which is not appropriate for continually running networks,
  and the widely used on-line gradient approximation technique of truncated backpropagation
  through time.
