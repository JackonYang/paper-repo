paperAbstract: Visual question answering is fundamentally compositional in nature-a
  question like where is the dog? shares substructure with questions like what color
  is the dog? and where is the cat? This paper seeks to simultaneously exploit the
  representational capacity of deep networks and the compositional linguistic structure
  of questions. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning neural module
  networks, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural "modules" into deep
  networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic
  substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks
  (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting
  compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach on two challenging
  datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
  the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions about abstract
  shapes.
