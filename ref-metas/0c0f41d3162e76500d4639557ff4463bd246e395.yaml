paperAbstract: "Visual question answering (VQA) is challenging, because it requires\
  \ a simultaneous understanding of both visual content of images and textual content\
  \ of questions. To support the VQA task, we need to find good solutions for the\
  \ following three issues: 1) fine-grained feature representations for both the image\
  \ and the question; 2) multimodal feature fusion that is able to capture the complex\
  \ interactions between multimodal features; and 3) automatic answer prediction that\
  \ is able to consider the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers\
  \ for the same question. For fine-grained image and question representations, a\
  \ \u201Ccoattention\u201D mechanism is developed using a deep neural network (DNN)\
  \ architecture to jointly learn the attentions for both the image and the question,\
  \ which can allow us to reduce the irrelevant features effectively and obtain more\
  \ discriminative features for image and question representations. For multimodal\
  \ feature fusion, a generalized multimodal factorized high-order pooling approach\
  \ (MFH) is developed to achieve more effective fusion of multimodal features by\
  \ exploiting their correlations sufficiently, which can further result in superior\
  \ VQA performance as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. For answer prediction,\
  \ the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence is used as the loss function to achieve precise\
  \ characterization of the complex correlations between multiple diverse answers\
  \ with the same or similar meaning, which can allow us to achieve faster convergence\
  \ rate and obtain slightly better accuracy on answer prediction. A DNN architecture\
  \ is designed to integrate all these aforementioned modules into a unified model\
  \ for achieving superior VQA performance. With an ensemble of our MFH models, we\
  \ achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale VQA data sets and\
  \ win the runner-up in VQA Challenge 2017."
