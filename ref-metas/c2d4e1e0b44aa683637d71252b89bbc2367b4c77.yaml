paperAbstract: "Subband coding has become quite popular for the source encoding of\
  \ speech. This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to\
  \ the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional\
  \ quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition,\
  \ and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional\
  \ QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared\
  \ error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed\
  \ to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum\
  \ quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution.\
  \ Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's).\
  \ The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete\
  \ cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization\
  \ for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \xD7 256 monochrome\
  \ images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."
