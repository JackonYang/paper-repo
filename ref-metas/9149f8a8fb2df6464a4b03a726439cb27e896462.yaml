paperAbstract: In this paper we formally define the structural description of an object
  and the concepts of exact and inexact matching of two structural descriptions. We
  discuss the problems associated with a brute-force backtracking tree search for
  inexact matching and develop several different algorithms to make the tree search
  more efficient. We develop the formula for the expected number of nodes in the tree
  for backtracking alone and with a forward checking algorithm. Finally, we present
  experimental results showing that forward checking is the most efficient of the
  algorithms tested.
