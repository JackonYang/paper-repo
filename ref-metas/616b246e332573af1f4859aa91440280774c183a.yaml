paperAbstract: "The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components:\
  \ (i)\_a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation\
  \ and standardised evaluation software; and (ii)\_an annual competition and workshop.\
  \ There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification,\
  \ and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008\u2013\
  2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers\
  \ who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the\
  \ VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation\
  \ of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers\
  \ have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future\
  \ challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets\
  \ we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for\
  \ determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant\
  \ or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across\
  \ classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method\
  \ for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and\
  \ easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted\
  \ algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance.\
  \ We also analyse the community\u2019s progress through time using the methods of\
  \ Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to\
  \ identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal\
  \ of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved\
  \ in future challenges."
