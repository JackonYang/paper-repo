paperAbstract: Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representingn objects geometrically
  byn points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in some sense to experimental
  dissimilarities between objects. In just what sense distances and dissimilarities
  should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these
  approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities
  and distances are monotonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying
  measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional
  scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness
  of fit. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in
  a companion paper.
