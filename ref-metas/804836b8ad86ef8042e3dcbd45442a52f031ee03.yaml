paperAbstract: "The quantitative evaluation of optical flow algorithms by Barron et\
  \ al. (1994) led to significant advances in performance. The challenges for optical\
  \ flow algorithms today go beyond the datasets and evaluation methods proposed in\
  \ that paper. Instead, they center on problems associated with complex natural scenes,\
  \ including nonrigid motion, real sensor noise, and motion discontinuities. We propose\
  \ a new set of benchmarks and evaluation methods for the next generation of optical\
  \ flow algorithms. To that end, we contribute four types of data to test different\
  \ aspects of optical flow algorithms: (1)\_sequences with nonrigid motion where\
  \ the ground-truth flow is determined by tracking hidden fluorescent texture, (2)\_\
  realistic synthetic sequences, (3)\_high frame-rate video used to study interpolation\
  \ error, and (4)\_modified stereo sequences of static scenes. In addition to the\
  \ average angular error used by Barron et\_al., we compute the absolute flow endpoint\
  \ error, measures for frame interpolation error, improved statistics, and results\
  \ at motion discontinuities and in textureless regions. In October 2007, we published\
  \ the performance of several well-known methods on a preliminary version of our\
  \ data to establish the current state of the art. We also made the data freely available\
  \ on the web at http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/. Subsequently a number of researchers\
  \ have uploaded their results to our website and published papers using the data.\
  \ A significant improvement in performance has already been achieved. In this paper\
  \ we analyze the results obtained to date and draw a large number of conclusions\
  \ from them."
