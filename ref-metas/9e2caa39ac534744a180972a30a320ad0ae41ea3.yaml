paperAbstract: The term word association is used in a very particular sense in the
  psycholinguistic literature. (Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than
  normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor.
  ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of
  a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of
  the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence
  constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper
  will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual
  information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora.
  (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand
  subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure,
  the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable
  corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words.
