paperAbstract: A comprehensive introduction to network flows that brings together
  the classic and the contemporary aspects of the field, and provides an integrative
  view of theory, algorithms, and applications. presents in-depth, self-contained
  treatments of shortest path, maximum flow, and minimum cost flow problems, including
  descriptions of polynomial-time algorithms for these core models. emphasizes powerful
  algorithmic strategies and analysis tools such as data scaling, geometric improvement
  arguments, and potential function arguments. provides an easy-to-understand descriptions
  of several important data structures, including d-heaps, Fibonacci heaps, and dynamic
  trees. devotes a special chapter to conducting empirical testing of algorithms.
  features over 150 applications of network flows to a variety of engineering, management,
  and scientific domains. contains extensive reference notes and illustrations.
