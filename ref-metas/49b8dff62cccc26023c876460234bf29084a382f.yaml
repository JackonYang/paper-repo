paperAbstract: We present a new method for transductive learning, which can be seen
  as a transductive version of the k nearest-neighbor classifier. Unlike for many
  other transductive learning methods, the training problem has a meaningful relaxation
  that can be solved globally optimally using spectral methods. We propose an algorithm
  that robustly achieves good generalization performance and that can be trained efficiently.
  A key advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require additional heuristics
  to avoid unbalanced splits. Furthermore, we show a connection to transductive Support
  Vector Machines, and that an effective Co-Training algorithm arises as a special
  case.
