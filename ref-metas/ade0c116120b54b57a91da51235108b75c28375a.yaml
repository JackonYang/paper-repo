paperAbstract: "Transfer and multi-task learning have traditionally focused on either\
  \ a single source-target pair or very few, similar tasks. Ideally, the linguistic\
  \ levels of morphology, syntax and semantics would benefit each other by being trained\
  \ in a single model. We introduce a joint many-task model together with a strategy\
  \ for successively growing its depth to solve increasingly complex tasks. Higher\
  \ layers include shortcut connections to lower-level task predictions to reflect\
  \ linguistic hierarchies. We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing\
  \ all model weights to improve one task\u2019s loss without exhibiting catastrophic\
  \ interference of the other tasks. Our single end-to-end model obtains state-of-the-art\
  \ or competitive results on five different tasks from tagging, parsing, relatedness,\
  \ and entailment tasks."
