paperAbstract: "Algorithms which are based on modeling speech as a finite\u2010state,\
  \ hidden Markov process have been very successful in recent years. This paper presents\
  \ a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden\
  \ Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic\
  \ analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many\
  \ grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an\
  \ arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous,\
  \ it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity.\
  \ Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition\
  \ process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra\
  \ component."
