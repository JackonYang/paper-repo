paperAbstract: "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in\
  \ two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range\
  \ of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter\
  \ for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian,\
  \ and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary\
  \ filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given\
  \ scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y)\
  \ for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u2207\
  2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels\
  \ are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and\
  \ evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes\
  \ in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination\
  \ boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized.\
  \ Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not\
  \ independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the\
  \ image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several\
  \ basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing\
  \ segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image\
  \ forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."
