paperAbstract: Speech-recognition systems must often decide between competing ways
  of breaking up the acoustic input into strings of words. Since the possible strings
  may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string,
  the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are
  discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of
  word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology)
  is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type.
  The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the
  Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of
  the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made.
