paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a system that integrates fully automatic
  scene geometry estimation, 2D object detection, 3D localization, trajectory estimation,
  and tracking for dynamic scene interpretation from a moving vehicle. Our sole input
  are two video streams from a calibrated stereo rig on top of a car. From these streams,
  we estimate structure-from-motion (SfM) and scene geometry in real-time. In parallel,
  we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians
  in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are
  converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame.
  A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically
  plausible spacetime trajectories. Finally, a global optimization criterion takes
  object-object interactions into account to arrive at accurate 3D localization and
  trajectory estimates for both cars and pedestrians. We demonstrate the performance
  of our integrated system on challenging real-world data showing car passages through
  crowded city areas.
