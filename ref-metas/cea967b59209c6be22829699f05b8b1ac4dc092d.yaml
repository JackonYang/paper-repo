paperAbstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved
  excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever
  large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences
  to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence
  learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses
  a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector
  of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence
  from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task
  from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score
  of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary
  words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison,
  a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When
  we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT
  system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of
  the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that
  are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive
  voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences
  (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing
  so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence
  which made the optimization problem easier.
