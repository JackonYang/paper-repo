paperAbstract: 'Abstract : MSYS is a system for reasoning with uncertain information
  and inexact rules of inference. Its major application, to date, has been to the
  interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application,
  features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods
  based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related
  by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with
  the interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process
  repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained.
  At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature.
  One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. The rules
  are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations
  of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation
  steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted.'
