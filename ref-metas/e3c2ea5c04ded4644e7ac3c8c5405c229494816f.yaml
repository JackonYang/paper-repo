paperAbstract: In this article we propose a local descriptor for an unconstrained
  handwritten word spotting task. The presented features are inspired by the SIFT
  keypoint descriptor, widely employed in computer vision and object recognition,
  but underexploited in the handwriting recognition field. In our approach, a sliding
  window moves from left to right over a word image. At each position, the window
  is subdivided into cells, and in each cell a histogram of orientations is accumulated.
  Experiments using two different word spotting systems hidden Markov models and dynamic
  time warping demonstrate a very significant improvement when using the proposed
  features with respect to the state-of-the-art ones.
