paperAbstract: This paper describes a method for synthesizing images that match the
  texture appearance of a given digitized sample. This synthesis is completely automatic
  and requires only the "target" texture as input. It allows generation of as much
  texture as desired so that any object can be covered. The approach is based on a
  model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful
  tool for image processing and graphics applications.
