paperAbstract: "We study the close connections between game theory, on-line prediction\
  \ and boosting. After a brief review of game theory, we describe an algorithm for\
  \ learning to play repeated games based on the on-line prediction methods of Littlestone\
  \ and Warmuth. The analysis of this algorithm yields a simple proof of von Neumann\u2019\
  s famous minmax theorem, as well as a provable method of approximately solving a\
  \ game. We then show that the on-line prediction model is obtained by applying this\
  \ gameplaying algorithm to an appropriate choice of game and that boosting is obtained\
  \ by applying the same algorithm to the \u201Cdual\u201D of this game."
