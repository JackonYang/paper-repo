paperAbstract: Image captioning often requires a large set of training image-sentence
  pairs. In practice, however, acquiring sufficient training pairs is always expensive,
  making the recent captioning models limited in their ability to describe objects
  outside of training corpora (i.e., novel objects). In this paper, we present Long
  Short-Term Memory with Copying Mechanism (LSTM-C) &#x2014; a new architecture that
  incorporates copying into the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) plus Recurrent
  Neural Networks (RNN) image captioning framework, for describing novel objects in
  captions. Specifically, freely available object recognition datasets are leveraged
  to develop classifiers for novel objects. Our LSTM-C then nicely integrates the
  standard word-by-word sentence generation by a decoder RNN with copying mechanism
  which may instead select words from novel objects at proper places in the output
  sentence. Extensive experiments are conducted on both MSCOCO image captioning and
  ImageNet datasets, demonstrating the ability of our proposed LSTM-C architecture
  to describe novel objects. Furthermore, superior results are reported when compared
  to state-of-the-art deep models.
