paperAbstract: '"Bag of words" models have enjoyed much attention and achieved good
  performances in recent studies of object categorization. In most of these works,
  local patches are modeled as basic building blocks of an image, analogous to words
  in text documents. In most previous works using the "bag of words" models (e.g.
  [4, 20, 7]), the local patches are assumed to be independent with each other. In
  this paper, we relax the independence assumption and model explicitly the inter-dependency
  of the local regions. Similarly to previous work , we represent images as a collection
  of patches, each of which belongs to a latent "theme" that is shared across images
  as well as categories. We learn the theme distributions and patch distributions
  over the themes in a hierarchical structure [22]. In particular, we introduce a
  linkage structure over the latent themes to encode the dependencies of the patches.
  This structure enforces the semantic connections among the patches by facilitating
  better clustering of the themes. As a result, our models for object categories tend
  to be more discriminative than the ones obtained under the independent patch assumption.
  We show highly competitive categorization results on both the Caltech 4 and Caltech
  101 object category datasets. By examining the distributions of the latent themes
  for each object category, we construct an object taxonomy using the 101 object classes
  from the Caltech 101 datasets.'
