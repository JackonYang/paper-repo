paperAbstract: 'This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical
  learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models
  include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected
  networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model
  data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations
  for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition,
  differentiation, andthe manipulation of probability models from the exponential
  family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical
  framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximizationalgorithm. Using these
  operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical
  specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward
  networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper
  concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some
  popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions
  here are the decompositiontechniques and the demonstration that graphical models
  provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.'
