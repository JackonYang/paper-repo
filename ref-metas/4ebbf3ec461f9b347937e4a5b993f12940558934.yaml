paperAbstract: Detecting people in images is key for several important application
  domains in computer vision. This paper presents an in-depth experimental study on
  pedestrian classification; multiple feature-classifier combinations are examined
  with respect to their ROC performance and efficiency. We investigate global versus
  local and adaptive versus nonadaptive features, as exemplified by PCA coefficients,
  Haar wavelets, and local receptive fields (LRFs). In terms of classifiers, we consider
  the popular support vector machines (SVMs), feedforward neural networks, and k-nearest
  neighbor classifier. Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of
  4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in
  outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing
  performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we
  investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated.
  Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data
  or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques. Our experiments show
  that the novel combination of SVMs with LRF features performs best. A boosted cascade
  of Haar wavelets can, however, reach quite competitive results, at a fraction of
  computational cost. The data set used in this paper is made public, establishing
  a benchmark for this important problem
