paperAbstract: "In this paper we investigate a new method of learning part-based models\
  \ for visual object recognition, from training data that only provides information\
  \ about class membership (and not object location or configuration). This method\
  \ learns both a model of local part appearance and a model of the spatial relations\
  \ between those parts. In contrast, other work using such a weakly supervised learning\
  \ paradigm has not considered the problem of simultaneously learning appearance\
  \ and spatial models. Some of these methods use a \u201Cbag\u201D model where only\
  \ part appearance is considered whereas other methods learn spatial models but only\
  \ given the output of a particular feature detector. Previous techniques for learning\
  \ both part appearance and spatial relations have instead used a highly supervised\
  \ learning process that provides substantial information about object part location.\
  \ We show that our weakly supervised technique produces better results than these\
  \ previous highly supervised methods. Moreover, we investigate the degree to which\
  \ both richer spatial models and richer appearance models are helpful in improving\
  \ recognition performance. Our results show that while both spatial and appearance\
  \ information can be useful, the effect on performance depends substantially on\
  \ the particular object class and on the difficulty of the test dataset."
