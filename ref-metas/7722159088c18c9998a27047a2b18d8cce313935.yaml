paperAbstract: "While research on articulated human motion and pose estimation has\
  \ progressed rapidly in the last few years, there has been no systematic quantitative\
  \ evaluation of competing methods to establish the current state of the art. We\
  \ present data obtained using a hardware system that is able to capture synchronized\
  \ video and ground-truth 3D motion. The resulting HumanEva datasets contain multiple\
  \ subjects performing a set of predefined actions with a number of repetitions.\
  \ On the order of 40,000 frames of synchronized motion capture and multi-view video\
  \ (resulting in over one quarter million image frames in total) were collected at\
  \ 60\_Hz with an additional 37,000 time instants of pure motion capture data. A\
  \ standard set of error measures is defined for evaluating both 2D and 3D pose estimation\
  \ and tracking algorithms. We also describe a baseline algorithm for 3D articulated\
  \ tracking that uses a relatively standard Bayesian framework with optimization\
  \ in the form of Sequential Importance Resampling and Annealed Particle Filtering.\
  \ In the context of this baseline algorithm we explore a variety of likelihood functions,\
  \ prior models of human motion and the effects of algorithm parameters. Our experiments\
  \ suggest that image observation models and motion priors play important roles in\
  \ performance, and that in a multi-view laboratory environment, where initialization\
  \ is available, Bayesian filtering tends to perform well. The datasets and the software\
  \ are made available to the research community. This infrastructure will support\
  \ the development of new articulated motion and pose estimation algorithms, will\
  \ provide a baseline for the evaluation and comparison of new methods, and will\
  \ help establish the current state of the art in human pose estimation and tracking."
