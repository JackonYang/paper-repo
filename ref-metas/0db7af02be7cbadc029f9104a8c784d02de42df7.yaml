paperAbstract: SVM training is a convex optimization problem which scales with the
  training set size rather than the feature space dimension. While this is usually
  considered to be a desired quality, in large scale problems it may cause training
  to be impractical. The common techniques to handle this difficulty basically build
  a solution by solving a sequence of small scale subproblems. Our current effort
  is concentrated on the rank of the kernel matrix as a source for further enhancement
  of the training procedure. We first show that for a low rank kernel matrix it is
  possible to design a better interior point method (IPM) in terms of storage requirements
  as well as computational complexity. We then suggest an efficient use of a known
  factorization technique to approximate a given kernel matrix by a low rank matrix,
  which in turn will be used to feed the optimizer. Finally, we derive an upper bound
  on the change in the objective function value based on the approximation error and
  the number of active constraints (support vectors). This bound is general in the
  sense that it holds regardless of the approximation method.
