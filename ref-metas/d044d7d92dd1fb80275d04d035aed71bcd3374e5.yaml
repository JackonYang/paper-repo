paperAbstract: 'Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires thousands
  of training examples; this is due to the diversity and richness of object appearance
  which requires models containing hundreds of parameters. We present a method for
  learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on
  incorporating "generic" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models
  of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object
  categories are represented by probabilistic models, and "prior" knowledge is represented
  as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The "posterior"
  model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one
  or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human
  faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt
  from hundreds of training examples, and a "prior" is estimated from these. Then
  the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is
  used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images.'
