paperAbstract: In text, lexical cohesion is the result of chains of related words
  that contribute to the continuity of lexical meaning. These lexical chains are a
  direct result of units of text being "about the same thing," and finding text structure
  involves finding units of text that are about the same thing. Hence, computing the
  chains is useful, since they will have a correspondence to the structure of the
  text. Determining the structure of text is an essential step in determining the
  deep meaning of the text. In this paper, a thesaurus is used as the major knowledge
  base for computing lexical chains. Correspondences between lexical chains and structural
  elements are shown to exist. Since the lexical chains are computable, and exist
  in non-domain-specific text, they provide a valuable indicator of text structure.
  The lexical chains also provide a semantic context for interpreting words, concepts,
  and sentences.
