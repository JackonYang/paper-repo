paperAbstract: We are concerned with the problem of image segmentation, in which each
  pixel is assigned to one of a predefined finite number of labels. In Bayesian image
  analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with
  a prior model of label images. Following the work of Bouman and Shapiro (1994),
  we consider the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) as prior models.
  The parameters in the TSBN are trained using a maximum-likelihood objective function
  with the EM algorithm and the resulting model is evaluated by calculating how efficiently
  it codes label images. A number of authors have used Gaussian mixture models to
  connect the label field to the image data. We compare this approach to the scaled-likelihood
  method of Smyth (1994) and Morgan and Bourlard (1995), where local predictions of
  pixel classification from neural networks are fused with the TSBN prior. Our results
  show a higher performance is obtained with the neural networks. We evaluate the
  classification results obtained and emphasize not only the maximum a posteriori
  segmentation, but also the uncertainty, as evidenced e.g., by the pixelwise posterior
  marginal entropies. We also investigate the use of conditional maximum-likelihood
  training for the TSBN and find that this gives rise to improved classification performance
  over the ML-trained TSBN.
