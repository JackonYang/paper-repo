paperAbstract: In this paper we propose and examine non-parametric statistical tests
  to define similarity and homogeneity measures for textures. The statistical tests
  are applied to the coefficients of images filtered by a multi-scale Gabor filter
  bank. We demonstrate that these similarity measures are useful for both, texture
  based image retrieval and for unsupervised texture segmentation, and hence offer
  a unified approach to these closely related tasks. We present results on Brodatz-like
  micro-textures and a collection of real-word images.
