paperAbstract: 'Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specific recurrent neural network
  (RNN) architecture that was designed to model temporal sequences and their long-range
  dependencies more accurately than conventional RNNs. In this paper, we explore LSTM
  RNN architectures for large scale acoustic modeling in speech recognition. We recently
  showed that LSTM RNNs are more effective than DNNs and conventional RNNs for acoustic
  modeling, considering moderately-sized models trained on a single machine. Here,
  we introduce the first distributed training of LSTM RNNs using asynchronous stochastic
  gradient descent optimization on a large cluster of machines. We show that a two-layer
  deep LSTM RNN where each LSTM layer has a linear recurrent projection layer can
  exceed state-of-the-art speech recognition performance. This architecture makes
  more effective use of model parameters than the others considered, converges quickly,
  and outperforms a deep feed forward neural network having an order of magnitude
  more parameters. Index Terms: Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM, recurrent neural network,
  RNN, speech recognition, acoustic modeling.'
