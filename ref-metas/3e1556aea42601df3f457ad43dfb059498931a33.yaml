paperAbstract: Example-based methods are effective for parameter estimation problems
  when the underlying system is simple or the dimensionality of the input is low.
  For complex and high-dimensional problems such as pose estimation, the number of
  required examples and the computational complexity rapidly become prohibitively
  high. We introduce a new algorithm that learns a set of hashing functions that efficiently
  index examples relevant to a particular estimation task. Our algorithm extends locality-sensitive
  hashing, a recently developed method to find approximate neighbors in time sublinear
  in the number of examples. This method depends critically on the choice of hash
  functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem. Experiments
  demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call parameter-sensitive hashing,
  can rapidly and accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a
  large database of example images.
