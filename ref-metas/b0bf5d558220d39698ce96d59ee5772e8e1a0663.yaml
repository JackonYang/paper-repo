paperAbstract: We describe experiments with eigenfaces for recognition and interactive
  search in a large-scale face database. Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated
  using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general
  viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace
  technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition,
  a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features
  such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation
  yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition.
  An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>
