paperAbstract: Relying entirely on an attention mechanism, the Transformer introduced
  by Vaswani et al. (2017) achieves state-of-the-art results for machine translation.
  In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly
  model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires
  adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present
  an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider
  representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements.
  On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this
  approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations,
  respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position
  representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We describe
  an efficient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance of relation-aware
  self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graph-labeled inputs.
