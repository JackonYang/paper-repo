paperAbstract: This paper describes a new model for understanding natural language
  commands given to autonomous systems that perform navigation and mobile manipulation
  in semi-structured environments. Previous approaches have used models with fixed
  structure to infer the likelihood of a sequence of actions given the environment
  and the command. In contrast, our framework, called Generalized Grounding Graphs
  (G3), dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a particular
  natural language command according to the command's hierarchical and compositional
  semantic structure. Our system performs inference in the model to successfully find
  and execute plans corresponding to natural language commands such as "Put the tire
  pallet on the truck." The model is trained using a corpus of commands collected
  using crowdsourcing. We pair each command with robot actions and use the corpus
  to learn the parameters of the model. We evaluate the robot's performance by inferring
  plans from natural language commands, executing each plan in a realistic robot simulator,
  and asking users to evaluate the system's performance. We demonstrate that our system
  can successfully follow many natural language commands from the corpus.
