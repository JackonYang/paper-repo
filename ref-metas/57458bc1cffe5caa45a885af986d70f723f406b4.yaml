paperAbstract: 'We describe a single convolutional neural network architecture that,
  given a sentence, outputs a host of language processing predictions: part-of-speech
  tags, chunks, named entity tags, semantic roles, semantically similar words and
  the likelihood that the sentence makes sense (grammatically and semantically) using
  a language model. The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using
  weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data
  except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel
  form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask
  learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks,
  resulting in state-of-the-art-performance.'
