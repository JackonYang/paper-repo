paperAbstract: To demonstrate the performance of content-based image retrieval systems
  (CBIRSs), there is not yet any standard data set that is widely used. The only dataset
  used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more
  than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately,
  basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus
  making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating
  the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same
  set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results,
  even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance
  measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with
  a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The
  techniques used in this article to "enhance" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa
  re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification
  and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger
  subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences
  in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the
  "apparent" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of
  CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and
  RJ.
