paperAbstract: 'For object recognition, the current state-of-the-art is based on exhaustive
  search. However, to enable the use of more expensive features and classifiers and
  thereby progress beyond the state-of-the-art, a selective search strategy is needed.
  Therefore, we adapt segmentation as a selective search by reconsidering segmentation:
  We propose to generate many approximate locations over few and precise object delineations
  because (1) an object whose location is never generated can not be recognised and
  (2) appearance and immediate nearby context are most effective for object recognition.
  Our method is class-independent and is shown to cover 96.7% of all objects in the
  Pascal VOC 2007 test set using only 1,536 locations per image. Our selective search
  enables the use of the more expensive bag-of-words method which we use to substantially
  improve the state-of-the-art by up to 8.5% for 8 out of 20 classes on the Pascal
  VOC 2010 detection challenge.'
