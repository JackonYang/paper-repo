paperAbstract: The interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception
  is reviewed, elaborated, and tested. According to the model context aids the perception
  of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication
  that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly
  influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments
  demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword
  contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to
  the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally
  perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or
  irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that
  share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed.
  The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification
  of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings
  that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed.
