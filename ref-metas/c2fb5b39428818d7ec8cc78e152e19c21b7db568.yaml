paperAbstract: 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been very successful
  in a variety of computer vision tasks, especially on those linked to recognition.
  Optical flow estimation has not been among the tasks CNNs succeeded at. In this
  paper we construct CNNs which are capable of solving the optical flow estimation
  problem as a supervised learning task. We propose and compare two architectures:
  a generic architecture and another one including a layer that correlates feature
  vectors at different image locations. Since existing ground truth data sets are
  not sufficiently large to train a CNN, we generate a large synthetic Flying Chairs
  dataset. We show that networks trained on this unrealistic data still generalize
  very well to existing datasets such as Sintel and KITTI, achieving competitive accuracy
  at frame rates of 5 to 10 fps.'
