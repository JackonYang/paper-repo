paperAbstract: "Recent advances in deep learning have made the use of large, deep\
  \ neural networks with tens of millions of parameters suitable for a number of applications\
  \ that require real-time processing. The sheer size of these networks can represent\
  \ a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs\
  \ are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial\
  \ for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce\
  \ this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout,\
  \ batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage\
  \ SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3\xD7 improvement over\
  \ an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example\
  \ task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN)\
  \ large vocabulary system can be built with a 10\xD7 speedup over an unoptimized\
  \ baseline and a 4\xD7 speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline\
  \ at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network\
  \ training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware."
