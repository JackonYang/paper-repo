paperAbstract: "We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization\
  \ of scattered data (mi) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean\
  \ space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual\
  \ framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold\
  \ of the ambient Euclidean space \u211Dn, is locally isometric to an open, connected\
  \ subset \u0398 of Euclidean space \u211Dd. Because \u0398 does not have to be convex,\
  \ this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than\
  \ the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic\
  \ form \u210B(f) = \u222BM\u2009\u2225Hf(m)\u2225\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\

  \ of f, and \u210B(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define\
  \ the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key\
  \ observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset\
  \ of \u211Dd, then \u210B(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of\
  \ the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original\
  \ isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to\
  \ a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear\
  \ embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps\
  \ framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place\
  \ of one based on the Laplacian."
