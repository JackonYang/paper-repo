paperAbstract: "The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models\
  \ with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of\
  \ large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in\
  \ representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs.\
  \ But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will\
  \ happen if we increase the dataset size by 10 \xD7 or 100 \xD7 ? This paper takes\
  \ a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between\
  \ \u2018enormous data\u2019 and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M\
  \ dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate\
  \ how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used\
  \ for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected)\
  \ findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically\
  \ based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning\
  \ (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on\
  \ many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected,\
  \ we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image\
  \ classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation.\
  \ Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the\
  \ data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets."
