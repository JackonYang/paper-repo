paperAbstract: We present a unifying framework for studying the solution of multiclass
  categorization problems by reducing them to multiple binary problems that are then
  solved using a margin-based binary learning algorithm. The proposed framework unifies
  some of the most popular approaches in which each class is compared against all
  others, or in which all pairs of classes are compared to each other, or in which
  output codes with error-correcting properties are used. We propose a general method
  for combining the classifiers generated on the binary problems, and we prove a general
  empirical multiclass loss bound given the empirical loss of the individual binary
  learning algorithms. The scheme and the corresponding bounds apply to many popular
  classification learning algorithms including support-vector machines, AdaBoost,
  regression, logistic regression and decision-tree algorithms. We also give a multiclass
  generalization error analysis for general output codes with AdaBoost as the binary
  learner. Experimental results with SVM and AdaBoost show that our scheme provides
  a viable alternative to the most commonly used multiclass algorithms.
