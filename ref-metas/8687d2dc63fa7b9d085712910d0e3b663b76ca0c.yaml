paperAbstract: In this paper we propose an approach to holistic scene understanding
  that reasons jointly about regions, location, class and spatial extent of objects,
  presence of a class in the image, as well as the scene type. Learning and inference
  in our model are efficient as we reason at the segment level, and introduce auxiliary
  variables that allow us to decompose the inherent high-order potentials into pairwise
  potentials between a few variables with small number of states (at most the number
  of classes). Inference is done via a convergent message-passing algorithm, which,
  unlike graph-cuts inference, has no submodularity restrictions and does not require
  potential specific moves. We believe this is very important, as it allows us to
  encode our ideas and prior knowledge about the problem without the need to change
  the inference engine every time we introduce a new potential. Our approach outperforms
  the state-of-the-art on the MSRC-21 benchmark, while being much faster. Importantly,
  our holistic model is able to improve performance in all tasks.
