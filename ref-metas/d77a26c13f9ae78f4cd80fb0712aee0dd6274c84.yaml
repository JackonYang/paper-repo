paperAbstract: This paper proposes a bottom-up approach for identifying and recognizing
  tables within a document. This approach is based on the paradigm of graph rewriting.
  First, the document image is transformed into a layout graph whose nodes and edges
  respectively represent document entities and their interrelations. This graph is
  subsequently rewritten using a set of rules designed for and based on apriori document
  knowledge and general formatting conventions. The resulting graph provides both
  logical and layout views of the document content.
