paperAbstract: Text detection in natural images has gained much attention in the last
  years as it is a primary step towards fully autonomous text recognition. Understanding
  the visual text content is of a vital importance in many applicative areas from
  the internet search engines to the PDA signboard translators. Images of natural
  scenes, however, pose numerous difficulties compared to the traditional scanned
  documents. They mainly contain diverse complex text of different sizes, styles and
  colors with complex backgrounds. Furthermore, such images are captured under variable
  lighting conditions and are often affected by the skew distortion and perspective
  projections. In this article an improved edge profile based text detection method
  is presented. It uses a set of heuristic rules to eliminate detection of non-text
  areas. The method is evaluated on CVL OCR DB, an annotated image database of text
  in natural scenes.
