paperAbstract: 'Text in natural images contains rich semantics that is often highly
  relevant to objects or scene. In this paper, we focus on the problem of fully exploiting
  scene text for visual understanding. The main idea is combining word representations
  and deep visual features in a globally trainable deep convolutional neural network.
  First, the recognized words are obtained by a scene text reading system. Next, we
  combine the word embedding of the recognized words and the deep visual features
  into a single representation that is optimized by a convolutional neural network
  for fine-grained image classification. In our framework, the attention mechanism
  is adopted to compute the relevance between each recognized word and the given image,
  which further enhances the recognition performance. We have performed experiments
  on two datasets: con-text dataset and drink bottle dataset, which are proposed for
  fine-grained classification of business places and drink bottles, respectively.
  The experimental results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method of combining
  textual and visual cues significantly outperforms classification with only visual
  representation. Moreover, we have shown that the learned representation improves
  the retrieval performance on the drink bottle images by a large margin, making it
  potentially powerful in product search.'
