paperAbstract: It is now well established that sparse signal models are well suited
  for restoration tasks and can be effectively learned from audio, image, and video
  data. Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead
  of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction,
  with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in
  terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version
  of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most
  general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework
  for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental
  results on standard handwritten digit and texture classification tasks.
