paperAbstract: "delineating the absolute indigeneity of amino acids in fossils. As\
  \ AMS iechniques are refined to handle smaller samples, it may also become possible\
  \ to date individual amino acid enantiomers by the \xB0C method. If one enantiomer\
  \ is entirely derived from the other by racemization during diagenesis, the individual\
  \ Dp. and L-enantiomers for a given amino acid should have identical \u201CC ages.\
  \ Older, more poorly preserved fossils may not always prove amenable to the determination\
  \ of amino acid indigeneity by the stable isotope method, as the prospects for complete\
  \ replacement of indigenous amino acids with non-indigenous amino acids increases\
  \ with time. As non-indigenous amino acids undergo racemization, the enantiomers\
  \ may have identical isotopic compositions and still not be related to the original\
  \ organisms. Such a circumstance may, however, become easier to recognize as more\
  \ information becomes available concerning the distribution and stable isotopic\
  \ composition of the amino acid constituents of modern representatives of fossil\
  \ organisms. Also, AMS dates on individual amino acid enantiomers may, in some cases,\
  \ help to clarify indigeneity problems, in particular when stratigraphic controls\
  \ can be used to estimate a general age range for the fossil in question. Finally,\
  \ the development of techniques for determining the stable isotopic compasition\
  \ of amino acid enantiomers may enable us to establish whether non-racemic amino\
  \ acids in some carbonaceous meteorites\u201D are indigenous, or result in part\
  \ from terrestrial contamination. M.H.E. thanks the NSF, Division of Earth Sciences\
