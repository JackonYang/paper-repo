paperAbstract: We present a new dataset for form understanding in noisy scanned documents
  (FUNSD) that aims at extracting and structuring the textual content of forms. The
  dataset comprises 199 real, fully annotated, scanned forms. The documents are noisy
  and vary widely in appearance, making form understanding (FoUn) a challenging task.
  The proposed dataset can be used for various tasks, including text detection, optical
  character recognition, spatial layout analysis, and entity labeling/linking. To
  the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset with comprehensive
  annotations to address FoUn task. We also present a set of baselines and introduce
  metrics to evaluate performance on the FUNSD dataset, which can be downloaded at
