paperAbstract: A nonparametric estimator of density gradient, the mean shift, is employed
  in the joint, spatial-range (value) domain of gray level and color images for discontinuity
  preserving filtering and image segmentation. Properties of the mean shift are reviewed
  and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates
  with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution
  of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only
  one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed
  technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range
  domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention
  of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples,
  for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably
  with results described in the literature for the same images.
