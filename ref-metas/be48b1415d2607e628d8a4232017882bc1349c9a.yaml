paperAbstract: Abstract. In this paper, we present a logical representation for form
  documents to be used for identification and retrieval. A hierarchical structure
  is proposed to represent the structure of a form by using lines and the XY-tree
  approach. The approach is top-down and no domain knowledge such as the preprinted
  data or filled-in data is used. Geometrical modifications and slight variations
  are handled by this representation. Logically identical forms are associated to
  the same or similar hierarchical structure. Identification and the retrieval of
  similar forms are performed by computing the edit distances between the generated
  trees.
