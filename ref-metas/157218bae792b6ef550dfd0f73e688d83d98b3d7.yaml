paperAbstract: A method is described for constructing long error-correcting codes
  from one or more shorter error-correcting codes, referred to as subcodes, and a
  bipartite graph. A graph is shown which specifies carefully chosen subsets of the
  digits of the new codes that must be codewords in one of the shorter subcodes. Lower
  bounds to the rate and the minimum distance of the new code are derived in terms
  of the parameters of the graph and the subeodes. Both the encoders and decoders
  proposed are shown to take advantage of the code's explicit decomposition into subcodes
  to decompose and simplify the associated computational processes. Bounds on the
  performance of two specific decoding algorithms are established, and the asymptotic
  growth of the complexity of decoding for two types of codes and decoders is analyzed.
  The proposed decoders are able to make effective use of probabilistic information
  supplied by the channel receiver, e.g., reliability information, without greatly
  increasing the number of computations required. It is shown that choosing a transmission
  order for the digits that is appropriate for the graph and the subcodes can give
  the code excellent burst-error correction abilities. The construction principles
