paperAbstract: Recently, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) have been proposed for phone
  recognition and were found to achieve highly competitive performance. In the original
  DBNs, only framelevel information was used for training DBN weights while it has
  been known for long that sequential or full-sequence information can be helpful
  in improving speech recognition accuracy. In this paper we investigate approaches
  to optimizing the DBN weights, state-to-state transition parameters, and language
  model scores using the sequential discriminative training criterion. We describe
  and analyze the proposed training algorithm and strategy, and discuss practical
  issues and how they affect the final results. We show that the DBNs learned using
  the sequence-based training criterion outperform those with frame-based criterion
  using both threelayer and six-layer models, but the optimization procedure for the
  deeper DBN is more difficult for the former criterion.
