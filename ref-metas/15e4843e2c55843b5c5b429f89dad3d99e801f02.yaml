paperAbstract: The inside-outside algorithm for inferring the parameters of a stochastic
  context-free grammar is extended to take advantage of constituent information (constituent
  bracketing) in a partially parsed corpus. Experiments on formal and natural language
  parsed corpora show that the new algorithm can achieve faster convergence and better
  modeling of hierarchical structure than the original one. In particular, over 90%
  test set bracketing accuracy was achieved for grammars inferred by our algorithm
  from a training set of handparsed part-of-speech strings for sentences in the Air
  Travel Information System spoken language corpus. Finally, the new algorithm has
  better time complexity than the original one when sufficient bracketing is provided.
