paperAbstract: 'We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces from
  frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as occlusion and
  disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear
  regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers
  the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by
  C1-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based)
  object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues
  in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature
  extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed,
  the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether
  the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation
  is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random
  projections perform just as well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and
  Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain
  threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can
  handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that
  these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory
  of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm
  can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion.
  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy
  of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.'
