paperAbstract: In this paper, we address the problem of retrospectively pruning decision
  trees induced from data, according to a top-down approach. This problem has received
  considerable attention in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning,
  and many distinct methods have been proposed in literature. We make a comparative
  study of six well-known pruning methods with the aim of understanding their theoretical
  foundations, their computational complexity, and the strengths and weaknesses of
  their formulation. Comments on the characteristics of each method are empirically
  supported. In particular, a wide experimentation performed on several data sets
  leads us to opposite conclusions on the predictive accuracy of simplified trees
  from some drawn in the literature. We attribute this divergence to differences in
  experimental designs. Finally, we prove and make use of a property of the reduced
  error pruning method to obtain an objective evaluation of the tendency to overprune/underprune
  observed in each method.
