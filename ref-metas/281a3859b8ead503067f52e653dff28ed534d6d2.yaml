paperAbstract: "In this paper we describe an algorithm that operates on the distances\
  \ between features in the two related images and delivers a set of correspondences\
  \ between them. The algorithm maximizes the inner product of two matrices, one of\
  \ which is the desired \u2018pairing matrix \u2019 and the other a \u2018proximity\
  \ matrix \u2019 with elements exp (\u2013 r2ij/2\u03C32), where rij is the distance\
  \ between two features, one in each image, and \u03C3 is an adjustable scale parameter.\
  \ The output of the algorithm may be compared with the movements that people perceive\
  \ when viewing two images in quick succession, and it is found that an increase\
  \ in \u03C3 affects the computed correspondences in much the same way as an increase\
  \ in interstimulus interval alters the perceived displacements. Provided that \u03C3\
  \ is not too small the algorithm will recover the feature mappings that result from\
  \ image translation, expansion or shear deformation \u2013 transformations of common\
  \ occurrence in image sequences \u2013 even when the displacements of individual\
  \ features depart slightly from the general trend."
