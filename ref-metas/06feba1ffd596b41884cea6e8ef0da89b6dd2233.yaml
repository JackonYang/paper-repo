paperAbstract: 'Predicting depth is an essential component in understanding the 3D
  geometry of a scene. While for stereo images local correspondence suffices for estimation,
  finding depth relations from a single image is less straightforward, requiring integration
  of both global and local information from various cues. Moreover, the task is inherently
  ambiguous, with a large source of uncertainty coming from the overall scale. In
  this paper, we present a new method that addresses this task by employing two deep
  network stacks: one that makes a coarse global prediction based on the entire image,
  and another that refines this prediction locally. We also apply a scale-invariant
  error to help measure depth relations rather than scale. By leveraging the raw datasets
  as large sources of training data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
  on both NYU Depth and KITTI, and matches detailed depth boundaries without the need
  for superpixelation.'
