paperAbstract: "The principles of Bayesian reasoning are reviewed and applied to problems\
  \ of inference from data sampled from Poisson, Gaussian and Cauchy distributions.\
  \ Probability distributions (priors and likelihoods) are assigned in appropriate\
  \ hypothesis spaces using the Maximum Entropy Principle, and then manipulated via\
  \ Bayes\u2019 Theorem. Bayesian hypothesis testing requires careful consideration\
  \ of the prior ranges of any parameters involved, and this leads to a quantitive\
  \ statement of Occam\u2019s Razor. As an example of this general principle we offer\
  \ a solution to an important problem in regression analysis; determining the optimal\
  \ number of parameters to use when fitting graphical data with a set of basis functions."
