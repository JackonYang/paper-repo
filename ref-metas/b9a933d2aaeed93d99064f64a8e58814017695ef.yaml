paperAbstract: As poo we get the space Em with the distance function maxi-, ... I
  xi X. Let, furthermore, lP stand for the space of real sequences with the series
  of pth powers of the absolute values convergent. Similarly let LP denote the space
  of real measurable functions in the interval (0, 1) which are summable to the pth
  power, while C shall mean the space of real continuous functions in the same interval.
  In all these spaces a distance function is assumed to be defined as usual. t L2
  is equivalent to the real Hilbert space t. The spaces EmP, IP and LP are metric
  only if p > 1, but we shall consider them also for positive values of p O). A general
  theorem of Banach and Mazur ([1], p. 187) states that any separable metric space
  (5 may be imbedded isometrically in the space C. Furthermore, as a special case
  of a well known theorem of Urysohn, any such space (E may be imbedded topologically
  in t. Isometric imbeddability of (E in '& is, however, a much more restricted property
  of (B. The chief purpose of this paper is to point out the intimate relationship
  between the problem of isometric imbedding and the concept of positive definite
  functions, if this concept is properly enlarged. As a first approach to this connection
  we consider here isometric imbedding in Hilbert space only. It turns out that the
  possibility of imbedding$ in 6& is very easily expressible in terms of the elementary
  function e-t2 and the concept of positive definite functions (Theorem 1). The author's
  previous result ([10]) to the effect that i(,y), (O <,y < 1), which is the space
