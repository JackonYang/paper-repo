paperAbstract: In this paper we present a new class of language models. This class
  derives from link grammar, a context-free formalism for the description of natural
  language. We describe an algorithm for determining maximum-likelihood estimates
  of the parameters of these models. The language models which we present differ from
  previous models based on stochastic context-free grammars in that they are highly
  lexical. In particular, they include the familiar $n$-gram models as a natural subclass.
  The motivation for considering this class is to estimate the contribution which
  grammar can make to reducing the relative entropy of natural language.
