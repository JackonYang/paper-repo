paperAbstract: A lack of standard datasets and evaluation metrics has prevented the
  field of paraphrasing from making the kind of rapid progress enjoyed by the machine
  translation community over the last 15 years. We address both problems by presenting
  a novel data collection framework that produces highly parallel text data relatively
  inexpensively and on a large scale. The highly parallel nature of this data allows
  us to use simple n-gram comparisons to measure both the semantic adequacy and lexical
  dissimilarity of paraphrase candidates. In addition to being simple and efficient
  to compute, experiments show that these metrics correlate highly with human judgments.
