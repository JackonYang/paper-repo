paperAbstract: In this article, we propose a family of efficient kernels for large
  graphs with discrete node labels. Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction
  scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the
  original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological
  and label information. A family of kernels can be defined based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman
  sequence of graphs, including a highly efficient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns.
  Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length
  of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels
  outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classification benchmark
  data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale
  applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology
  and social network analysis.
