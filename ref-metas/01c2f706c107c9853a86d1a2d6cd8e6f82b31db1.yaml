paperAbstract: Scene content understanding facilitates a large number of applications,
  ranging from content-based image retrieval to other multimedia applications. Material
  detection refers to the problem of identifying key semantic material types (such
  as sky, grass, foliage, water, and snow in images). In this paper, we present a
  holistic approach to determining scene content, based on a set of individual material
  detection algorithms, as well as probabilistic spatial context models. A major limitation
  of individual material detectors is the significant number of misclassifications
  that occur because of the similarities in color and texture characteristics of various
  material types. We have developed a spatial context-aware material detection system
  that reduces misclassification by constraining the beliefs to conform to the probabilistic
  spatial context models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of materials
  detection is improved by 13% using the spatial context models over the individual
  material detectors themselves.
