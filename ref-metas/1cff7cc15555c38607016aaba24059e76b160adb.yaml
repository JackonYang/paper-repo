paperAbstract: This paper describes a corpus annotation project to study issues in
  the manual annotation of opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations
  and other private states in language. The resulting corpus annotation scheme is
  described, as well as examples of its use. In addition, the manual annotation process
  and the results of an inter-annotator agreement study on a 10,000-sentence corpus
  of articles drawn from the world press are presented.
