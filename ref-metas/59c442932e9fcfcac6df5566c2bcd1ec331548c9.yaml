paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe a new model for word alignment in statistical
  translation and present experimental results. The idea of the model is to make the
  alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions
  rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a
  first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are
  used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference
  to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible
  word orderings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several
  bilingual corpora.
