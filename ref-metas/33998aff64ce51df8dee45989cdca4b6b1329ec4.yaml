paperAbstract: 'We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures
  that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers
  to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their
  approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their
  neighborhoods'' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to
  different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation
  (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this
  way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously,
  and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems.
  Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established
  transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation
  network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test
  graphs remain unseen during training).'
