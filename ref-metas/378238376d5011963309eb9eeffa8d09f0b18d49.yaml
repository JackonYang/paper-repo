paperAbstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon initially observed in text retrieval, is the
  property that a given visual element appears more times in an image than a statistically
  independent model would predict. In the context of image search, burstiness corrupts
  the visual similarity measure, i.e., the scores used to rank the images. In this
  paper, we propose a strategy to handle visual bursts for bag-of-features based image
  search systems. Experimental results on three reference datasets show that our method
  significantly and consistently outperforms the state of the art.
