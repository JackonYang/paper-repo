paperAbstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that
  is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however,
  do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been
  focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this
  pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing
  time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state
  of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical
  processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure
  of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent
  networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic
  gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.
