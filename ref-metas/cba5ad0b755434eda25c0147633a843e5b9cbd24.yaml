paperAbstract: A new class of kernels for object recognition based on local image
  feature representations are introduced in this paper. These kernels satisfy the
  Mercer condition and incorporate multiple types of local features and semilocal
  constraints between them. Experimental results of SVM classifiers coupled with the
  proposed kernels are reported on recognition tasks with the COIL-100 database and
  compared with existing methods. The proposed kernels achieved competitive performance
  and were robust to changes in object configurations and image degradations.
