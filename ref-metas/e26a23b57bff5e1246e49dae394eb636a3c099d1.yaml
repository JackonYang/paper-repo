paperAbstract: 'Representing and modeling the motion and spatial support of multiple
  objects and surfaces from motion video sequences is an important intermediate step
  towards dynamic image understanding. One such representation, called layered representation,
  has recently been proposed. Although a number of algorithms have been developed
  for computing these representations, there has not been a consolidated effort into
  developing a precise mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper presents
  one such formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixture models
  and the minimum description length (MDL) encoding principle. The three major issues
  in layered motion representation are: (i) how many motion models adequately describe
  image motion, (ii) what are the motion model parameters, and (iii) what is the spatial
  support layer for each motion model.<<ETX>>'
