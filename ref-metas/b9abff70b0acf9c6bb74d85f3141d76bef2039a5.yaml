paperAbstract: "A probabilistic expert system provides a graphical representation\
  \ of a joint probability distribution which can be used to simplify and localize\
  \ calculations. Jensenet al. (1990) introduced a \u2018flow-propagation\u2019 algorithm\
  \ for calculating marginal and conditional distributions in such a system. This\
  \ paper analyses that algorithm in detail, and shows how it can be modified to perform\
  \ other tasks, including maximization of the joint density and simultaneous \u2018\
  fast retraction\u2019 of evidence entered on several variables."
