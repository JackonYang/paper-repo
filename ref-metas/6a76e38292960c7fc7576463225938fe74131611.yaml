paperAbstract: "Several significant sets of labeled samples of image data are surveyed\
  \ that can be used in the development of algorithms for offline and online handwriting\
  \ recognition as well as for machine printed text recognition. The method used to\
  \ gather each data set, the numbers of samples they contain, and the associated\
  \ truth data are discussed. In the domain of offline handwriting, the CEDAR, NIST,\
  \ and CENPARMI data sets are pre\xAD sented. These contain primarily isolated digits\
  \ and alphabetic characters. The UNIPEN data set of online handwriting was collected\
  \ from a number of independent sources and it contains individual characters as\
  \ well as handwritten phrases. The University of Wash\xAD ington document image\
  \ databases are also discussed. They contain a large number of English and Japanese\
  \ document images that were selected from a range of publications."
