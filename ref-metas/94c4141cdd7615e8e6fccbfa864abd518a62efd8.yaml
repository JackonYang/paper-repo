paperAbstract: "Digital video is rapidly becoming an important source for information,\
  \ entertainment and a host of multimedia applications. With the size of these collections\
  \ growing to thousands of hours, technology is needed to effectively browse segments\
  \ in a short time without losing the content of the video. We propose a method to\
  \ extract the significant audio and video information and create a \u201Cskim\u201D\
  \ video which represents a short synopsis of the original. The extraction of significant\
  \ information, such as specific objects, audio keywords and relevant video structure,\
  \ is made possible through the integration of techniques in image and language understanding.\
  \ The resulting skim is much smaller, and retains the essential content of the original\
  \ segment. This research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation under grant\
  \ no. IRI9411299, the National Space and Aeronautics Administration, and the Advanced\
  \ Research Projects Agency. The views and conclusions contained in this document\
  \ are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing\
