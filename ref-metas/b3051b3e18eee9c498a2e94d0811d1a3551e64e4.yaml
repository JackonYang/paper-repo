paperAbstract: A central problem in grounded language acquisition is learning the
  correspondences between a rich world state and a stream of text which references
  that world state. To deal with the high degree of ambiguity present in this setting,
  we present a generative model that simultaneously segments the text into utterances
  and maps each utterance to a meaning representation grounded in the world state.
  We show that our model generalizes across three domains of increasing difficulty---Robocup
  sportscasting, weather forecasts (a new domain), and NFL recaps.
