paperAbstract: We address in this paper the question of how the knowledge of the marginal
  distribution P(x) can be incorporated in a learning algorithm. We suggest three
  theoretical methods for taking into account this distribution for regularization
  and provide links to existing graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. We
  also propose practical implementations.
