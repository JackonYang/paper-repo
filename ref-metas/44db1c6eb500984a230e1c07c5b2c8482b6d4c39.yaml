paperAbstract: In this paper we present a novel class-based segmentation method, which
  is guided by a stored representation of the shape of objects within a general class
  (such as horse images). The approach is different from bottom-up segmentation methods
  that primarily use the continuity of grey-level, texture, and bounding contours.
  We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can
  deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the
  relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and
  suggest how they can be usefully combined.
