paperAbstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from
  still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts
  organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task.
  Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining
  good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular,
  we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as
  a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated
  class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict
  joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts.
  This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body
  parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent
  typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments,
  we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint
  localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.
