paperAbstract: Learning a generative model of natural images is a useful way of extracting
  features that capture interesting regularities. Previous work on learning such models
  has focused on methods in which the latent features are used to determine the mean
  and variance of each pixel independently, or on methods in which the hidden units
  determine the covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. In this work,
  we propose a probabilistic model that combines these two approaches into a single
  framework. We represent each image using one set of binary latent features that
  model the image-specific covariance and a separate set that model the mean. We show
  that this approach provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple-cell
  complex-cell architecture, it produces very realistic samples of natural images
  and it extracts features that yield state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on the
  challenging CIFAR 10 dataset.
