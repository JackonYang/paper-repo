paperAbstract: 'In the statistical learning framework, the use of appropriate kernels
  may be the key for substantial improvement in solving a given problem. In essence,
  a kernel is a similarity measure between input points satisfying some mathematical
  requirements and possibly capturing the domain knowledge. We focus on kernels for
  images: we represent the image information content with binary strings and discuss
  various bitwise manipulations obtained using logical operators and convolution with
  nonbinary stencils. In the theoretical contribution of our work, we show that histogram
  intersection is a Mercer''s kernel and we determine the modifications under which
  a similarity measure based on the notion of Hausdorff distance is also a Mercer''s
  kernel. In both cases, we determine explicitly the mapping from input to feature
  space. The presented experimental results support the relevance of our analysis
  for developing effective trainable systems.'
