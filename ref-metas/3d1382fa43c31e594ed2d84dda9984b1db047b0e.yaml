paperAbstract: "Visual Question Answering (VQA) emerges as one of the most fascinating\
  \ topics in computer vision recently. Many state of the art methods naively use\
  \ holistic visual features with language features into a Long Short-Term Memory\
  \ (LSTM) module, neglecting the sophisticated interaction between them. This coarse\
  \ modeling also blocks the possibilities of exploring finer-grained local features\
  \ that contribute to the question answering dynamically over time. \nThis paper\
  \ addresses this fundamental problem by directly modeling the temporal dynamics\
  \ between language and all possible local image patches. When traversing the question\
  \ words sequentially, our end-to-end approach explicitly fuses the features associated\
  \ to the words and the ones available at multiple local patches in an attention\
  \ mechanism, and further combines the fused information to generate dynamic messages,\
  \ which we call episode. We then feed the episodes to a standard question answering\
  \ module together with the contextual visual information and linguistic information.\
  \ Motivated by recent practices in deep learning, we use auxiliary loss functions\
  \ during training to improve the performance. Our experiments on two latest public\
  \ datasets suggest that our method has a superior performance. Notably, on the DARQUAR\
  \ dataset we advanced the state of the art by 6$\\%$, and we also evaluated our\
  \ approach on the most recent MSCOCO-VQA dataset."
