paperAbstract: We propose an approach to include contextual features for labeling
  images, in which each pixel is assigned to one of a finite set of labels. The features
  are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several
  components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the
  image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field.
  Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns
  while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive
  divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data.
  We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a
  classifier and a Markov random field.
