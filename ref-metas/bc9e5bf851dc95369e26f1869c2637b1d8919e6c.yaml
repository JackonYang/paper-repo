paperAbstract: "Recent work has considered corpus-based or statistical approaches\
  \ to the problem of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. Typically, ambiguous\
  \ verb phrases of the form v np1 p np2 are resolved through a model which considers\
  \ values of the four head words (v, n1, p and n2). This paper shows that the problem\
  \ is analogous to n-gram language models in speech recognition, and that one of\
  \ the most common methods for language modeling, the backed-off estimate, is applicable.\
  \ Results on Wall Street Journal data of 84.5% accuracy are obtained using this\
  \ method. A surprising result is the importance of low-count events \u2014 ignoring\
  \ events which occur less than 5 times in training data reduces performance to 81.6%."
