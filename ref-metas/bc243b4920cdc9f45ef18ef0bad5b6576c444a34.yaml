paperAbstract: While discriminative training (e.g., CRF, structural SVM) holds much
  promise for machine translation, image segmentation, and clustering, the complex
  inference these applications require make exact training intractable. This leads
  to a need for approximate training methods. Unfortunately, knowledge about how to
  perform efficient and effective approximate training is limited. Focusing on structural
  SVMs, we provide and explore algorithms for two different classes of approximate
  training algorithms, which we call undergenerating (e.g., greedy) and overgenerating
  (e.g., relaxations) algorithms. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis
  of both types of approximate trained structural SVMs, focusing on fully connected
  pairwise Markov random fields. We find that models trained with overgenerating methods
  have theoretic advantages over undergenerating methods, are empirically robust relative
  to their undergenerating brethren, and relaxed trained models favor non-fractional
  predictions from relaxed predictors.
