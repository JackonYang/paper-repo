paperAbstract: This paper describes a probabilistic decomposition of human dynamics
  at multiple abstractions, and shows how to propagate hypotheses across space, time,
  and abstraction levels. Recognition in this framework is the succession of very
  general low level grouping mechanisms to increased specific and learned model based
  grouping techniques at higher levels. Hard decision thresholds are delayed and resolved
  by higher level statistical models and temporal context. Low-level primitives are
  areas of coherent motion found by EM clustering, mid-level categories are simple
  movements represented by dynamical systems, and high-level complex gestures are
  represented by Hidden Markov Models as successive phases of ample movements. We
  show how such a representation can be learned from training data, and apply It to
  the example of human gait recognition.
