paperAbstract: We present a novel structure learning method, Max Margin AND/OR graph
  (MM-AOG), for parsing the human body into parts and recovering their poses. Our
  method represents the human body and its parts by an AND/OR graph, which is a multi-level
  mixture of Markov random fields (MRFs). Max-margin learning, which is a generalization
  of the training algorithm for support vector machines (SVMs), is used to learn the
  parameters of the AND/OR graph model discriminatively. There are four advantages
  from this combination of AND/OR graphs and max-margin learning. Firstly, the AND/OR
  graph allows us to handle enormous articulated poses with a compact graphical model.
  Secondly, max-margin learning has more discriminative power than the traditional
  maximum likelihood approach. Thirdly, the parameters of the AND/OR graph model are
  optimized globally. In particular, the weights of the appearance model for individual
  nodes and the relative importance of spatial relationships between nodes are learnt
  simultaneously. Finally, the kernel trick can be used to handle high dimensional
  features and to enable complex similarity measure of shapes. We perform comparison
  experiments on the base ball datasets, showing significant improvements over state
  of the art methods.
