paperAbstract: While human pose estimation (HPE) techniques usually process each test
  image independently, in real applications images come in collections containing
  interdependent images. Often several images have similar backgrounds or show persons
  wearing similar clothing (foreground). We present a novel human pose estimation
  technique to exploit these dependencies by sharing appearance models between images.
  Our technique automatically determines which images in the collection should share
  appearance. We extend the state-of-the art HPE model of Yang and Ramanan to include
  our novel appearance sharing cues and demonstrate on the highly challenging Leeds
  Sports Poses dataset that they lead to better results than traditional single-image
  pose estimation.
