paperAbstract: The problem of recognizing and locating rigid objects in 3-D space
  is important for applications of robotics and naviga tion. We analyze the task requirements
  in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what
  kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms.
  We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives,
  such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this
  representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects
  while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited,
  which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient
  use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser
  range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general
  and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile.
