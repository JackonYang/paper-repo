paperAbstract: A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training
  patterns and the decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to
  a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials,
  and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically
  to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination
  of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest
  to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the
  leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical
  character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when
  compared with other learning algorithms.
