paperAbstract: 'Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There
  is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the
  brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations.
  But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects.
  Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able
  to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other
  methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn
  holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is
  distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These
  constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
  not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented
  as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties:
  the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change
  sign.'
