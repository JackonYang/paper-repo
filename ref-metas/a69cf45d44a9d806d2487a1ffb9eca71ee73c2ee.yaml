paperAbstract: This paper presents our recent work on the design and development of
  a new, large scale dataset, which we name MS MARCO, for MAchine Reading COmprehension.
  This new dataset is aimed to overcome a number of well-known weaknesses of previous
  publicly available datasets for the same task of reading comprehension and question
  answering. In MS MARCO, all questions are sampled from real anonymized user queries.
  The context passages, from which answers in the dataset are derived, are extracted
  from real web documents using the most advanced version of the Bing search engine.
  The answers to the queries are human generated. Finally, a subset of these queries
  has multiple answers. We aim to release one million queries and the corresponding
  answers in the dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most comprehensive
  real-world dataset of its kind in both quantity and quality. We are currently releasing
  100,000 queries with their corresponding answers to inspire work in reading comprehension
  and question answering along with gathering feedback from the research community.
