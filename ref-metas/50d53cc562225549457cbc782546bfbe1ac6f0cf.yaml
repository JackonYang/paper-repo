paperAbstract: Knowledge bases are an important resource for question answering and
  other tasks but often suffer from incompleteness and lack of ability to reason over
  their discrete entities and relationships. In this paper we introduce an expressive
  neural tensor network suitable for reasoning over relationships between two entities.
  Previous work represented entities as either discrete atomic units or with a single
  entity vector representation. We show that performance can be improved when entities
  are represented as an average of their constituting word vectors. This allows sharing
  of statistical strength between, for instance, facts involving the "Sumatran tiger"
  and "Bengal tiger." Lastly, we demonstrate that all models improve when these word
  vectors are initialized with vectors learned from unsupervised large corpora. We
  assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations
  between entities given a subset of the knowledge base. Our model outperforms previous
  models and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet and FreeBase with an accuracy
  of 86.2% and 90.0%, respectively.
