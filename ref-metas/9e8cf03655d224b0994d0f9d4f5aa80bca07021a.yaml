paperAbstract: 'Recurrent Cascade-Correlation (RCC) is a recurrent version of the
  Cascade-Correlation learning architecture of Fahlman and Lebiere [Fahlman, 1990].
  RCC can learn from examples to map a sequence of inputs into a desired sequence
  of outputs. New hidden units with recurrent connections are added to the network
  as needed during training. In effect, the network builds up a finite-state machine
  tailored specifically for the current problem. RCC retains the advantages of Cascade-Correlation:
  fast learning, good generalization, automatic construction of a near-minimal multi-layered
  network, and incremental training.'
