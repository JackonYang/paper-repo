paperAbstract: "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is used as a technique for measuring\
  \ the coherence of texts. By comparing the vectors for 2 adjoining segments of text\
  \ in a high\u2010dimensional semantic space, the method provides a characterization\
  \ of the degree of semantic relatedness between the segments. We illustrate the\
  \ approach for predicting coherence through reanalyzing sets of texts from 2 studies\
  \ that manipulated the coherence of texts and assessed readers\u2019 comprehension.\
  \ The results indicate that the method is able to predict the effect of text coherence\
  \ on comprehension and is more effective than simple term\u2010term overlap measures.\
  \ In this manner, LSA can be applied as an automated method that produces coherence\
  \ predictions similar to propositional modeling. We describe additional studies\
  \ investigating the application of LSA to analyzing discourse structure and examine\
  \ the potential of LSA as a psychological model of coherence effects in text comprehension."
