paperAbstract: The principle that for every document analysis task there exists a
  mechanism for creating well-defined ground-truth is a widely held tenet. Past experience
  with standard datasets providing ground-truth for character recognition and page
  segmentation tasks supports this belief. In the process of attempting to evaluate
  several table recognition algorithms we have been developing, however, we have uncovered
  a number of serious hurdles connected with the ground-truthing of tables. This problem
  may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears. We present a detailed analysis
  of why table ground-truthing is so hard, including the notions that there may exist
  more than one acceptable "truth" and/or incomplete or partial "truths".
