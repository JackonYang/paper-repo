paperAbstract: 'Voxel occupancy is one approach for reconstructing the 3-dimensional
  shape of an object from multiple views. In voxel occupancy, the task is to produce
  a binary labeling of a set of voxels, that determines which voxels are filled and
  which are empty. In this paper, we give an energy minimization formulation of the
  voxel occupancy problem. The global minimum of this energy can be rapidly computed
  with a single graph cut, using a result due to D. Greig et al. (1989). The energy
  function we minimize contains a data term and a smoothness term. The data term is
  a sum over the individual voxels, where the penalty for a voxel is based on the
  observed intensities of the pixels that intersect it. The smoothness term is the
  number of empty voxels adjacent to filled ones. Our formulation can be viewed as
  a generalization of silhouette intersection, with two advantages: we do not compute
  silhouettes, which are a major source of errors; and we can naturally incorporate
  spatial smoothness. We give experimental results showing reconstructions from both
  real and synthetic imagery. Reconstruction using this smoothed energy function is
  not much more time consuming than simple silhouette intersection; it takes about
  10 seconds to reconstruct a one million voxel volume.'
