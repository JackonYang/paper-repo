paperAbstract: Many neural network learning procedures compute gradients of the errors
  on the output layer of units after they have settled to their final values. We describe
  a procedure for finding E/wij, where E is an error functional of the temporal trajectory
  of the states of a continuous recurrent network and wij are the weights of that
  network. Computing these quantities allows one to perform gradient descent in the
  weights to minimize E. Simulations in which networks are taught to move through
  limit cycles are shown. This type of recurrent network seems particularly suited
  for temporally continuous domains, such as signal processing, control, and speech.
