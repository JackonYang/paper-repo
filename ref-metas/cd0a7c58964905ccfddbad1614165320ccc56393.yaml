paperAbstract: Visual question answering requires high-order reasoning about an image,
  which is a fundamental capability needed by machine systems to follow complex directives.
  Recently, modular networks have been shown to be an effective framework for performing
  visual reasoning tasks. While modular networks were initially designed with a degree
  of model transparency, their performance on complex visual reasoning benchmarks
  was lacking. Current state-of-the-art approaches do not provide an effective mechanism
  for understanding the reasoning process. In this paper, we close the performance
  gap between interpretable models and state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods.
  We propose a set of visual-reasoning primitives which, when composed, manifest as
  a model capable of performing complex reasoning tasks in an explicitly-interpretable
  manner. The fidelity and interpretability of the primitives' outputs enable an unparalleled
  ability to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting model. Critically,
  we show that these primitives are highly performant, achieving state-of-the-art
  accuracy of 99.1% on the CLEVR dataset. We also show that our model is able to effectively
  learn generalized representations when provided a small amount of data containing
  novel object attributes. Using the CoGenT generalization task, we show more than
  a 20 percentage point improvement over the current state of the art.
