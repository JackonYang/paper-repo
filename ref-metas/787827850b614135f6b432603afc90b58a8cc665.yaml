paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThe accessible presentation of this book gives\
  \ both a general view of the entire computer vision enterprise and also offers sufficient\
  \ detail to be able to build useful applications. Users learn techniques that have\
  \ proven to be useful by first-hand experience and a wide range of mathematical\
  \ methods. A CD-ROM with every copy of the text contains source code for programming\
  \ practice, color images, and illustrative movies. Comprehensive and up-to-date,\
  \ this book includes essential topics that either reflect practical significance\
  \ or are of theoretical importance. Topics are discussed in substantial and increasing\
  \ depth. Application surveys describe numerous important application areas such\
  \ as image based rendering and digital libraries. Many important algorithms broken\
  \ down and illustrated in pseudo code. Appropriate for use by engineers as a comprehensive\
  \ reference to the computer vision enterprise."
