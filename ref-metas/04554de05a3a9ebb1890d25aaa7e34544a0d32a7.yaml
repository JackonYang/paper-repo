paperAbstract: In the matching tasks which form an integral part of all types of tracking
  and geometrical vision, there are invariably priors available on the absolute and/or
  relative image locations of features of interest. Usually, these priors are used
  post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates,
  via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC.
  In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically
  to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much
  fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially,
  we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular,
  our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic
  mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the
  most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by
  expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching
  as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching
  can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion
  necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions.
