paperAbstract: Finding suitable, less space consuming views for a document's main
  content is crucial to provide convenient access to large document collections on
  display devices of different size. We present a novel compact visualization which
  represents the document's key semantic as a mixture of images and important key
  terms, similar to cards in a top trumps game. The key terms are extracted using
  an advanced text mining approach based on a fully automatic document structure extraction.
  The images and their captions are extracted using a graphical heuristic and the
  captions are used for a semi-semantic image weighting. Furthermore, we use the image
  color histogram for classification and show at least one representative from each
  non-empty image class. The approach is demonstrated for the IEEE InfoVis publications
  of a complete year. The method can easily be applied to other publication collections
  and sets of documents which contain images.
