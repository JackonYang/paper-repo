paperAbstract: "We describe the results of extensive experiments using optimized rule-based\
  \ induction methods on large document collections. The goal of these methods is\
  \ to discover automatically classification patterns that can be used for general\
  \ document categorization or personalized filtering of free text. Previous reports\
  \ indicate that human-engineered rule-based systems, requiring many man-years of\
  \ developmental efforts, have been successfully built to \u201Cread\u201D documents\
  \ and assign topics to them. We show that machine-generated decision rules appear\
  \ comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation.\
  \ In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark\
  \ from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously\
  \ reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%. In the context of a very\
  \ high-dimensional feature space, several methodological alternatives are examined,\
  \ including universal versus local dictionaries, and binary versus frequency-related\
  \ features."
