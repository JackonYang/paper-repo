paperAbstract: In many structured prediction problems, the highest-scoring labeling
  is hard to compute exactly, leading to the use of approximate inference methods.
  However, when inference is used in a learning algorithm, a good approximation of
  the score may not be sufficient. We show in particular that learning can fail even
  with an approximate inference method with rigorous approximation guarantees. There
  are two reasons for this. First, approximate methods can effectively reduce the
  expressivity of an underlying model by making it impossible to choose parameters
  that reliably give good predictions. Second, approximations can respond to parameter
  changes in such a way that standard learning algorithms are misled. In contrast,
  we give two positive results in the form of learning bounds for the use of LP-relaxed
  inference in structured perceptron and empirical risk minimization settings. We
  argue that without understanding combinations of inference and learning, such as
  these, that are appropriately compatible, learning performance under approximate
  inference cannot be guaranteed.
