paperAbstract: Many images, especially those used for page design on Web pages, as
  well as videos contain visible text. If these text occurrences could be detected,
  segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level
  semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and
  segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using
  a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed
  scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated
  into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text
  lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting
  the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to
  a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters
  on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation
  performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution
  approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences
  into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel
  accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created
  for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can
  also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4.
