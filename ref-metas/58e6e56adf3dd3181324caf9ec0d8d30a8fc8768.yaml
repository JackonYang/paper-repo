paperAbstract: If striate cells had the receptive-field (RF) shapes classically attributed
  to them, their preferred spatial frequencies would vary considerably with orientation.
  Other models of RF shape would predict a greater independence between orientation
  and spatial-frequency tuning. We have examined this by recording the responses of
  cat striate-cortex cells to a wide range of different spatial-frequency and orientation
  combinations. In almost all cells studied, peak orientation did not consistently
  vary with spatial frequency, but the majority of cells showed some change in peak
  spatial-frequency tuning with orientation. The amount of change in peak spatial
  frequency tended to be greater for cells that were narrowly tuned for orientation.
  However, cells narrowly (and also very broadly) tuned for spatial frequency tended
  to show considerable independence of spatial-frequency and orientation tuning, and
  in all but a few cells the degree of change was less than predicted by the classic
  RF model. Such cells were found to fire only to patterns whose local spatial spectra
  fell within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency
  region. We conclude that the two-dimensional RF shape of striate cells more closely
  approximates that predicted by a two-dimensional Gabor model or by a Gaussian-derivative
  model than it does the classic shape based on the output of geniculate cells with
  aligned RF's.
