paperAbstract: "In this paper, we show how new training principles and optimization\
  \ techniques for neural networks can be used for different network structures. In\
  \ particular, we revisit the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which explicitly models\
  \ the Markovian dynamics of a set of observations through a non-linear function\
  \ with a much larger hidden state space than traditional sequence models such as\
  \ an HMM. We apply pretraining principles used for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and\
  \ second-order optimization techniques to train an RNN. Moreover, we explore its\
  \ application in the Aurora2 speech recognition task under mismatched noise conditions\
  \ using a Tandem approach. We observe top performance on clean speech, and under\
  \ high noise conditions, compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and DNNs, with\
  \ the added benefit of being a \u201Cdeeper\u201D model than an MLP but more compact\
  \ than a DNN."
