paperAbstract: We present a general method using kernel canonical correlation analysis
  to learn a semantic representation to web images and their associated text. The
  semantic space provides a common representation and enables a comparison between
  the text and images. In the experiments, we look at two approaches of retrieving
  images based on only their content from a text query. We compare orthogonalization
  approaches against a standard cross-representation retrieval technique known as
  the generalized vector space model.
