paperAbstract: Reading text from photographs is a challenging problem that has received
  a significant amount of attention. Two key components of most systems are (i) text
  detection from images and (ii) character recognition, and many recent methods have
  been proposed to design better feature representations and models for both. In this
  paper, we apply methods recently developed in machine learning -- specifically,
  large-scale algorithms for learning the features automatically from unlabeled data
  -- and show that they allow us to construct highly effective classifiers for both
  detection and recognition to be used in a high accuracy end-to-end system.
