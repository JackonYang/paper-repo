paperAbstract: We propose a general method for finding pointwise correspondence between
  2-D shapes based on the concept of order structure and using geometric hashing.
  The problem of finding correspondence and the problem of establishing shape equivalence
  can be considered as one and the same problem. Given shape equivalence, we can in
  general and pointwise correspondence and the existence of a unambiguous correspondence
  mapping can be used as a rule for deciding shape equivalence. As a measure of shape
  equivalence we will use the concept of order structure which in principle can be
  defined for arbitrary geometric configurations such as points lines and curves.
  The order structure equivalence of subsets of points and tangent directions of a
  shape is will be used to establish pointwise correspondence. The finding of correspondence
  between different views of the same object and different instances of the same object
  category can be used as a foundation for establishment and recognition of visual
  categories.
