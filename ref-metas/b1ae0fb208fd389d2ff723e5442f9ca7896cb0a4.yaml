paperAbstract: "We proposed a model of Time Warping Invariant Neural Networks (TWINN)\
  \ to handle the time warped continuous signals. Although TWINN is a simple modification\
  \ of well known recurrent neural network, analysis has shown that TWINN completely\
  \ removes time warping and is able to handle difficult classification problem. It\
  \ is also shown that TWINN has certain advantages over the current available sequential\
  \ processing schemes: Dynamic Programming(DP)[1], Hidden Markov Model(HMM)[2], Time\
  \ Delayed Neural Networks(TDNN) [3] and Neural Network Finite Automata(NNFA)[4].\
  \ \n \nWe also analyzed the time continuity employed in TWINN and pointed out that\
  \ this kind of structure can memorize longer input history compared with Neural\
  \ Network Finite Automata (NNFA). This may help to understand the well accepted\
  \ fact that for learning grammatical reference with NNFA one had to start with very\
  \ short strings in training set. \n \nThe numerical example we used is a trajectory\
  \ classification problem. This problem, making a feature of variable sampling rates,\
  \ having internal states, continuous dynamics, heavily time-warped data and deformed\
  \ phase space trajectories, is shown to be difficult to other schemes. With TWINN\
  \ this problem has been learned in 100 iterations. For benchmark we also trained\
  \ the exact same problem with TDNN and completely failed as expected."
