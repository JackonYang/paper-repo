paperAbstract: A sequential optical character recognition algorithm, ideally suited
  for implementation by means of microprocessors with limited storage capabilities,
  is formulated in terms of a binary decision tree. Upper bounds On the recognition
  performance are derived in terms of the stability of the digitized picture elements.
  The design process is described in detail. The algorithm is tested on single-font
  typewritten characters and the experimental and theoretical results are compared.
