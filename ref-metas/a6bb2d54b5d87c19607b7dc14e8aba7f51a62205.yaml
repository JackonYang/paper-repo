paperAbstract: 'An end-to-end real-time scene text localization and recognition method
  is presented. The three main novel features are: (i) keeping multiple segmentations
  of each character until the very last stage of the processing when the context of
  each character in a text line is known, (ii) an efficient algorithm for selection
  of character segmentations minimizing a global criterion, and (iii) showing that,
  despite using theoretically scale-invariant methods, operating on a coarse Gaussian
  scale space pyramid yields improved results as many typographical artifacts are
  eliminated. The method runs in real time and achieves state-of-the-art text localization
  results on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading dataset. Results are also reported for
  end-to-end text recognition on the ICDAR 2011 dataset.'
