paperAbstract: 'Under a weak perspective camera model, the image plane coordinates
  in different views of a planar object are related by an affine transformation. Because
  of this property, researchers have attempted to use affine invariants for recognition.
  However, there are two problems with this approach: (1) objects or object classes
  with inherent variability cannot be adequately treated using invariants; and (2)
  in practice the calculated affine invariants can be quite sensitive to errors in
  the image plane measurements. In this paper we use probability distributions to
  address both of these difficulties. Under the assumption that the feature positions
  of a planar object can be modeled using a jointly Gaussian density, we have derived
  the joint density over the corresponding set of affine coordinates. Even when the
  assumptions of a planar object and a weak perspective camera model do not strictly
  hold, the results are useful because deviations from the ideal can be treated as
  deformability in the underlying object model.'
