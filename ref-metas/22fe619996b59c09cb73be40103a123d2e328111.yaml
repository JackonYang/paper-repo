paperAbstract: "The \u201CGerman Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark\u201D is a multi-category\
  \ classification competition held at IJCNN 2011. Automatic recognition of traffic\
  \ signs is required in advanced driver assistance systems and constitutes a challenging\
  \ real-world computer vision and pattern recognition problem. A comprehensive, lifelike\
  \ dataset of more than 50,000 traffic sign images has been collected. It reflects\
  \ the strong variations in visual appearance of signs due to distance, illumination,\
  \ weather conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. The images are complemented\
  \ by several precomputed feature sets to allow for applying machine learning algorithms\
  \ without background knowledge in image processing. The dataset comprises 43 classes\
  \ with unbalanced class frequencies. Participants have to classify two test sets\
  \ of more than 12,500 images each. Here, the results on the first of these sets,\
  \ which was used in the first evaluation stage of the two-fold challenge, are reported.\
  \ The methods employed by the participants who achieved the best results are briefly\
  \ described and compared to human traffic sign recognition performance and baseline\
  \ results."
