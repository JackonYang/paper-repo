paperAbstract: In this paper we describe two new objective automatic evaluation methods
  for machine translation. The first method is based on longest common subsequence
  between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations. Longest common
  subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and
  identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence n-grams automatically. The second method
  relaxes strict n-gram matching to skip-bigram matching. Skip-bigram is any pair
  of words in their sentence order. Skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics measure the
  overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
  The empirical results show that both methods correlate with human judgments very
  well in both adequacy and fluency.
