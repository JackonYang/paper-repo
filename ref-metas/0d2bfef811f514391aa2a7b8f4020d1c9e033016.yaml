paperAbstract: An approach to the detection and identification of human faces is presented,
  and a working, near-real-time face recognition system which tracks a subject's head
  and then recognizes the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those
  of known individuals is described. This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional
  recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright
  and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images
  are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation
  among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are
  the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated
  features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn
  to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>
