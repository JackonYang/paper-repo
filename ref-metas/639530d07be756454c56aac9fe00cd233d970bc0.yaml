paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid method to robustly and accurately
  localize texts in natural scene images. A text region detector is designed to generate
  a text confidence map, based on which text components can be segmented by local
  binarization approach. A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, considering the unary
  component property as well as binary neighboring component relationship, is then
  presented to label components as "text" or "non-text". Last, text components are
  grouped into text lines with an energy minimization approach. Experimental results
  show that the proposed method gives promising performance comparing with the existing
  methods on ICDAR 2003 competition dataset.
