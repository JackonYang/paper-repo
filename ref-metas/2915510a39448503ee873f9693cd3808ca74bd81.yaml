paperAbstract: We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions
  of body joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take
  an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation
  that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification
  problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate
  body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored
  3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and
  finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware.
  Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates
  the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy
  in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over
  exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.
