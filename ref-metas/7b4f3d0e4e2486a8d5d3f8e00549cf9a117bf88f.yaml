paperAbstract: 'Many machine learning tasks can be expressed as the transformation---or
  \emph{transduction}---of input sequences into output sequences: speech recognition,
  machine translation, protein secondary structure prediction and text-to-speech to
  name but a few. One of the key challenges in sequence transduction is learning to
  represent both the input and output sequences in a way that is invariant to sequential
  distortions such as shrinking, stretching and translating. Recurrent neural networks
  (RNNs) are a powerful sequence learning architecture that has proven capable of
  learning such representations. However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined
  alignment between the input and output sequences to perform transduction. This is
  a severe limitation since \emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect
  of many sequence transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the
  output sequence is often challenging. This paper introduces an end-to-end, probabilistic
  sequence transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in principle able
  to transform any input sequence into any finite, discrete output sequence. Experimental
  results for phoneme recognition are provided on the TIMIT speech corpus.'
