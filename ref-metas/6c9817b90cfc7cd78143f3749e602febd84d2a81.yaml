paperAbstract: We propose a method for segmenting gray-value images. By segmentation,
  we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected
  component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and
  "meaningful" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values
  by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold
  values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps
  each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a
  smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal
  solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial
  time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast
  to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient,
  usually not yielding closed boundaries.
