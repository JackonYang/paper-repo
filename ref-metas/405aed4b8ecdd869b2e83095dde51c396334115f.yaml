paperAbstract: Many modern visual recognition algorithms incorporate a step of spatial
  'pooling', where the outputs of several nearby feature detectors are combined into
  a local or global 'bag of features', in a way that preserves task-related information
  while removing irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image
  transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and
  clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can
  greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical.
  In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling
  methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the
  sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features
  have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and
  average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition
  tasks.
