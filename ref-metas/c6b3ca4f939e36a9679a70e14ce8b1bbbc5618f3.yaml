paperAbstract: "Most face databases have been created under controlled conditions\
  \ to facilitate the study of specific parameters on the face recognition problem.\
  \ These parameters include such variables as position, pose, lighting, background,\
  \ camera quality, and gender. While there are many applications for face recognition\
  \ technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there\
  \ are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control\
  \ over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as\
  \ an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database\
  \ contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered\
  \ in everyday life. The database exhibits \u201Cnatural\u201D variability in factors\
  \ such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition\
  \ to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms\
  \ for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research\
  \ performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide\
  \ baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system\
  \ combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database,\
  \ we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version."
