paperAbstract: 'Extractive reading comprehension systems can often locate the correct
  answer to a question in a context document, but they also tend to make unreliable
  guesses on questions for which the correct answer is not stated in the context.
  Existing datasets either focus exclusively on answerable questions, or use automatically
  generated unanswerable questions that are easy to identify. To address these weaknesses,
  we present SQuADRUn, a new dataset that combines the existing Stanford Question
  Answering Dataset (SQuAD) with over 50,000 unanswerable questions written adversarially
  by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuADRUn, systems
  must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer
  is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering. SQuADRUn is a challenging
  natural language understanding task for existing models: a strong neural system
  that gets 86% F1 on SQuAD achieves only 66% F1 on SQuADRUn. We release SQuADRUn
  to the community as the successor to SQuAD.'
