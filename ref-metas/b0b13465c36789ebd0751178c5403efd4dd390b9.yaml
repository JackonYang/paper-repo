paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells were studied
  in the light-adapted spider monkey. All fields mapped with white light had a concentric
  arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated
  ''on'' centre surrounded by an antagonistic ''off'' periphery, or the reverse. The
  smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres
  tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre
  had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina)
  and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2
  degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured
  stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an ''on'' response and
  light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an ''off'' response. Transition
  between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this
  wave-length evoked only feebel ''off'' responses. Very weak responses were obtained
  to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long
  wavelengths. (Author)'
