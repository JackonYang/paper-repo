paperAbstract: 'From Pythagoras''s harmonic sequence to Einstein''s theory of relativity,
  geometric models of position, proximity, ratio, and the underlying properties of
  physical space have provided us with powerful ideas and accurate scientific tools.
  Currently, similar geometric models are being applied to another type of space the
  conceptual space of information and meaning, where the contributions of Pythagoras
  and Einstein are a part of the landscape itself. The rich geometry of conceptual
  space can be glimpsed, for instance, in internet documents: while the documents
  themselves define a structure of visual layouts and point-to-point links, search
  engines create an additional structure by matching keywords to nearby documents
  in a spatial arrangement of content. What the "Geometry of Meaning" provides is
  a much-needed exploration of computational techniques to represent meaning and of
  the conceptual spaces on which these representations are founded."'
