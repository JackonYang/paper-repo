paperAbstract: In this paper we compare the performance of interest point descriptors.
  Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. However, it is
  unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends
  on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the
  same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point
  detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false
  positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare
  SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential
  invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman,
  2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different
  types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the
  descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform
  best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given
  the low dimensionality.
