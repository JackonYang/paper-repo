paperAbstract: Concepts of correlation and regression may be applied not only to ordinary
  one-dimensional variates but also to variates of two or more dimensions. Marksmen
  side by side firing simultaneous shots at targets, so that the deviations are in
  part due to independent individual errors and in part to common causes such as wind,
  provide a familiar introduction to the theory of correlation; but only the correlation
  of the horizontal components is ordinarily discussed, whereas the complex consisting
  of horizontal and vertical deviations may be even more interesting. The wind at
  two places may be compared, using both components of the velocity in each place.
  A fluctuating vector is thus matched at each moment with another fluctuating vector.
  The study of individual differences in mental and physical traits calls for a detailed
  study of the relations between sets of correlated variates. For example the scores
  on a number of mental tests may be compared with physical measurements on the same
  persons. The questions then arise of determining the number and nature of the independent
  relations of mind and body shown by these data to exist, and of extracting from
  the multiplicity of correlations in the system suitable characterizations of these
  independent relations. As another example, the inheritance of intelligence in rats
  might be studied by applying not one but s different mental tests to N mothers and
  to a daughter of each
