paperAbstract: 'This paper introduces a representation of evidential relationships
  which permits updating of belief in two simultaneous modes: causal (i. e. top-down)
  and diagnostic (i.e. bottom-up). It extends the hierarchical tree representation
  by allowing multiple causes to a given manifestation. We develop an updating scheme
  that obeys the axioms of probability, is computationally efficient, and is compatible
  with experts reasoning. The belief parameters of each variable are defined and updated
  by those of its neighbors in such a way that the impact of each new evidence propagates
  and settles through the network in a single pass.'
