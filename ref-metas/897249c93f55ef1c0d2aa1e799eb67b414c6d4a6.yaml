paperAbstract: Conditional random fields for sequence labeling offer advantages over
  both generative models like HMMs and classifiers applied at each sequence position.
  Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing, shallow parsing has received
  much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and extensive
  comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to
  achieve performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on
  the CoNLL task, and better than any reported single model. Improved training methods
  based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results.
  We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm
  and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy
  models.
