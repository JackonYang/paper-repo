paperAbstract: We extend the capabilities of neural networks by coupling them to external
  memory resources, which they can interact with by attentional processes. The combined
  system is analogous to a Turing Machine or Von Neumann architecture but is differentiable
  end-toend, allowing it to be efficiently trained with gradient descent. Preliminary
  results demonstrate that Neural Turing Machines can infer simple algorithms such
  as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples.
