paperAbstract: We propose a simple approach to combining first-order logic and probabilistic
  graphical models in a single representation. A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order
  knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with
  a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov
  network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula
  in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC
  over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query.
  Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing
  a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive
  logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge
  base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.
