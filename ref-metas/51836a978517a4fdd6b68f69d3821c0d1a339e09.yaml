paperAbstract: An algorithm is proposed for maximum entropy modeling. It enables probabilistic
  modeling of complete structures, such as transition sequences in Markov models and
  parse trees, without dividing them into independent sub-events. A probabilistic
  event is represented by a feature forest, which is a packed representation of features
  with ambiguities. The parameters are efficiently estimated by traversing each node
  in a feature forest by dynamic programming. Experiments showed the algorithm worked
  efficiently even when ambiguities in a feature forest cause an exponential explosion
  of unpacked structures.
