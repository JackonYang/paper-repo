paperAbstract: A computer system is described in which isolated words, spoken by a
  designated talker, are recognized through calculation of a minimum prediction residual.
  A reference pattern for each word to be recognized is stored as a time pattern of
  linear prediction coefficients (LPC). The total log prediction residual of an input
  signal is minimized by optimally registering the reference LPC onto the input autocorrelation
  coefficients using the dynamic programming algorithm (DP). The input signal is recognized
  as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction residual. A sequential
  decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in DP. A frequency
  normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce
  effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections. The system
  has been implemented on a DDP-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment.
  The recognition rate for a designated male talker is 97.3 percent for telephone
  input, and the recognition time is about 22 times real time.
