paperAbstract: "The Teacher Forcing algorithm trains recurrent networks by supplying\
  \ observed sequence values as inputs during training and using the network\u2019\
  s own one-step-ahead predictions to do multi-step sampling. We introduce the Professor\
  \ Forcing algorithm, which uses adversarial domain adaptation to encourage the dynamics\
  \ of the recurrent network to be the same when training the network and when sampling\
  \ from the network over multiple time steps. We apply Professor Forcing to language\
  \ modeling, vocal synthesis on raw waveforms, handwriting generation, and image\
  \ generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer,\
  \ improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST.\
  \ We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples, especially when sampling\
  \ for a large number of time steps. This is supported by human evaluation of sample\
  \ quality. Trade-offs between Professor Forcing and Scheduled Sampling are discussed.\
  \ We produce T-SNEs showing that Professor Forcing successfully makes the dynamics\
  \ of the network during training and sampling more similar."
