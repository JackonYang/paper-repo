paperAbstract: "A major problem for kernel-based predictors (such as Support Vector\
  \ Machines and Gaussian processes) is that the amount of computation required to\
  \ find the solution scales as O(n3), where n is the number of training examples.\
  \ We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can\
  \ be computed by the Nystrom method (which is used for the numerical solution of\
  \ eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller\
  \ system of size m < n, and then expanding the results back up to n dimensions.\
  \ The computational complexity of a predictor using this approximation is O(m2n).\
  \ We report experiments on the USPS and abalone data sets and show that we can set\
  \ m \u226A n without any significant decrease in the accuracy of the solution."
