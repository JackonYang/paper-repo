paperAbstract: Deep networks have been successfully applied to unsupervised feature
  learning for single modalities (e.g., text, images or audio). In this work, we propose
  a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities.
  We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep
  networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate
  cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video)
  can be learned if multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature
  learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between
  modalities and evaluate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with
  audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our models are validated
  on the CUAVE and AVLetters datasets on audio-visual speech classification, demonstrating
  best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effective shared representation
  learning.
