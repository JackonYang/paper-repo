paperAbstract: This paper presents a rapid and robust parsing system currently used
  to learn from large bodies of unedited text. The system contains a multivalued part-of-speech
  disambiguator and a novel parser employing bottom-up recognition to find the constituent
  phrases of larger structures that might be too difficult to analyze. The results
  of applying the disambiguator and parser to large sections of the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen
  corpus are presented.
