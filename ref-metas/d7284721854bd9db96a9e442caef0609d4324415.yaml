paperAbstract: 'With the widespread use of mobile phones and scanners to photograph
  and upload documents, the need for extracting the information trapped in unstructured
  document images such as retail receipts, insurance claim forms and financial invoices
  is becoming more acute. A major hurdle to this objective is that these images often
  contain information in the form of tables and extracting data from tabular sub-images
  presents a unique set of challenges. This includes accurate detection of the tabular
  region within an image, and subsequently detecting and extracting information from
  the rows and columns of the detected table. While some progress has been made in
  table detection, extracting the table contents is still a challenge since this involves
  more fine grained table structure(rows & columns) recognition. Prior approaches
  have attempted to solve the table detection and structure recognition problems independently
  using two separate models. In this paper, we propose TableNet: a novel end-to-end
  deep learning model for both table detection and structure recognition. The model
  exploits the interdependence between the twin tasks of table detection and table
  structure recognition to segment out the table and column regions. This is followed
  by semantic rule-based row extraction from the identified tabular sub-regions. The
  proposed model and extraction approach was evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR
  2013 and Marmot Table datasets obtaining state of the art results. Additionally,
  we demonstrate that feeding additional semantic features further improves model
  performance and that the model exhibits transfer learning across datasets. Another
  contribution of this paper is to provide additional table structure annotations
  for the Marmot data, which currently only has annotations for table detection.'
