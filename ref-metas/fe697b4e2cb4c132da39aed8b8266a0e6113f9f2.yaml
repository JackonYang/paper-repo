paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The present paper may be considered as a sequel to our
  previous paper in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Theorie
  generale de noyaux reproduisants-Premiere partie (vol. 39 (1944)) which was written
  in 1942-1943. In the introduction to this paper we outlined the plan of papers which
  were to follow. In the meantime, however, the general theory has been developed
  in many directions, and our original plans have had to be changed. Due to wartime
  conditions we were not able, at the time of writing the first paper, to take into
  account all the earlier investigations which, although sometimes of quite a different
  character, were, nevertheless, related to our subject. Our investigation is concerned
  with kernels of a special type which have been used under different names and in
  different ways in many domains of mathematical research. We shall therefore begin
  our present paper with a short historical introduction in which we shall attempt
  to indicate the different manners in which these kernels have been used by various
  investigators, and to clarify the terminology. We shall also discuss the more important
  trends of the application of these kernels without attempting, however, a complete
  bibliography of the subject matter. (KAR) P. 2'
