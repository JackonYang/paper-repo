paperAbstract: SUMMARY A generalization of the sampling method introduced by Metropolis
  et al. (1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques
  of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo
  estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal
  matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising
  in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions,
  Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods.
  However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional
  probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis
  and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations
  with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the
  distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from
  which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used
  for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx
  = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent
  samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain
  the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}.
  This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is
  a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the
  weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small,
  or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however,
  these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are
  important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey
  (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance
  sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation
  technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is
  unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some
  function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional
