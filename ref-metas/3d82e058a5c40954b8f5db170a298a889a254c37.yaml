paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nConnectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach\
  \ describes the theory and implementation of a method to incorporate neural network\
  \ approaches into state-of-the-art continuous speech recognition systems based on\
  \ Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to improve their performance. In this framework, neural\
  \ networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted\
  \ to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation\
  \ and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international\
  \ collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that\
  \ demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with\
  \ more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages\
  \ and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using\
  \ standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown\
  \ that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches\
  \ are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these\
  \ methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone\
  \ intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework\
  \ provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research\
  \ and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard\
  \ and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural\
  \ network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses\
  \ on neural networks or speech processing."
