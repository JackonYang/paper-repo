paperAbstract: We describe Photo OCR, a system for text extraction from images. Our
  particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal
  of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially
  available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning
  has substantially improved isolated character classification, we build on this progress
  by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate
  modern data center-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable
  of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional
  OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low
  contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency,
  mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark
  datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more
  than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use
  in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google
  Translate for Android.
