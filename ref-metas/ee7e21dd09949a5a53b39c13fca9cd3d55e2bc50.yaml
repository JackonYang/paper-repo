paperAbstract: 'Most work in statistical parsing has focused on a single corpus: the
  Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. While this has allowed for quantitative
  comparison of parsing techniques, it has left open the question of how other types
  of text might a ect parser performance, and how portable parsing models are across
  corpora. We examine these questions by comparing results for the Brown and WSJ corpora,
  and also consider which parts of the parser''s probability model are particularly
  tuned to the corpus on which it was trained. This leads us to a technique for pruning
  parameters to reduce the size of the parsing model.'
