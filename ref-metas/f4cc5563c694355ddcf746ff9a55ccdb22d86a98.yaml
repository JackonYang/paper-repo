paperAbstract: 'Finite-machines have been used in various domains of natural language
  processing. We consider here the use of a type of transducer that supports very
  efficient programs: sequential transducers. We recall classical theorems and give
  new ones characterizing sequential string-to-string transducers. Transducers that
  outpur weights also play an important role in language and speech processing. We
  give a specific study of string-to-weight transducers, including algorithms for
  determinizing and minizizing these transducers very efficiently, and characterizations
  of the transducers admitting determinization and the corresponding algorithms. Some
  applications of these algorithms in speech recognition are described and illustrated.'
