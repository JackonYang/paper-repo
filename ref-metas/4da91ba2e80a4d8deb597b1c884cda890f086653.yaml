paperAbstract: 'The objective of this work is to enlarge the class of camera motions
  for which epipolar geometry and image correspondences can be computed automatically.
  This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two
  extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly,
  a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner
  neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative
  corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure
  developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies,
  and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation.
  The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs
  with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic.'
