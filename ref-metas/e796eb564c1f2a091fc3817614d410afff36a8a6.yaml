paperAbstract: 'In this paper we present a real-world evaluation of DMOS, a new generic
  document recognition method. This method uses a new grammatical formalism (EPF)
  and an associated parser able to introduce context in segmentation. We have implemented
  this DMOS method to build an automatic generator of structured document recognition
  systems. We already produced three recognition systems by only changing the EPF
  grammar: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive
  table structures. We present here a specific light grammar to automatically recognize
  quite damaged 19th century military forms. The quality of those forms is far from
  perfect: table lines are not well printed, paper is so thin that there are transparency
  problems (the forms are two-sided) but the biggest problem comes from small paper
  sheets hiding part of the structure. The evaluation of this system has been made
  onto 5268 images and the results show that the system did not make any mistake.
  Moreover it can recognize the entire structure in 97.2% of the forms (the other
  2.8% are automatically set apart).'
