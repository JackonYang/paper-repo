paperAbstract: "\u2022 A picture in Radiance is a map of RGB radiance (or irradiance)\
  \ values \u2022 The exposure of a Radiance picture may be adjusted without loss\
  \ since it contains a dynamic range on the order of 10^77 \u2022 Individual radiance\
  \ (or luminance) values may be displayed on demand by the X11 viewer, ximage \u2022\
  \ The falsecolor program may be used to convert an image to a numerically readable\
  \ value map with legend \u2022 The glare program may be used to identify and analyze\
  \ glare sources in a picture or scene \u2022 Other programs (principally rtrace)\
  \ may be used to compute values that are not easily represented as a map"
