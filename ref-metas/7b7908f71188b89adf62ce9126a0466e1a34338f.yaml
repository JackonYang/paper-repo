paperAbstract: 'A large number of novel encodings for bag of visual words models have
  been proposed in the past two years to improve on the standard histogram of quantized
  local features. Examples include locality-constrained linear encoding [23], improved
  Fisher encoding [17], super vector encoding [27], and kernel codebook encoding [20].
  While several authors have reported very good results on the challenging PASCAL
  VOC classification data by means of these new techniques, differences in the feature
  computation and learning algorithms, missing details in the description of the methods,
  and different tuning of the various components, make it impossible to compare directly
  these methods and hard to reproduce the results reported. This paper addresses these
  shortcomings by carrying out a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques by: (1)
  fixing the other elements of the pipeline (features, learning, tuning); (2) disclosing
  all the implementation details, and (3) identifying both those aspects of each method
  which are particularly important to achieve good performance, and those aspects
  which are less critical. This allows a consistent comparative analysis of these
  encoding methods. Several conclusions drawn from our analysis cannot be inferred
  from the original publications.'
