paperAbstract: Recognizing text character from natural scene images is a challenging
  problem due to background interferences and multiple character patterns. Scene Text
  Character (STC) recognition, which generally includes feature representation to
  model character structure and multi-class classification to predict label and score
  of character class, mostly plays a significant role in word-level text recognition.
  The contribution of this paper is a complete performance evaluation of image-based
  STC recognition, by comparing different sampling methods, feature descriptors, dictionary
  sizes, coding and pooling schemes, and SVM kernels. We systematically analyze the
  impact of each option in the feature representation and classification. The evaluation
  results on two datasets CHARS74K and ICDAR2003 demonstrate that Histogram of Oriented
  Gradient (HOG) descriptor, soft-assignment coding, max pooling, and Chi-Square Support
  Vector Machines (SVM) obtain the best performance among local sampling based feature
  representations. To improve STC recognition, we apply global sampling feature representation.
  We generate Global HOG (GHOG) by computing HOG descriptor from global sampling.
  GHOG enables better character structure modeling and obtains better performance
  than local sampling based feature representations. The GHOG also outperforms existing
  methods in the two benchmark datasets.
