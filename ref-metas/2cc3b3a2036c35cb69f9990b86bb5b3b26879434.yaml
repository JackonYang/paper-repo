paperAbstract: 'Standard techniques for improved generalization from neural networks
  include weight decay and pruning. Weight decay has a Bayesian interpretation with
  the decay function corresponding to a prior over weights. The method of transformation
  groups and maximum entropy suggests a Laplace rather than a gaussian prior. After
  training, the weights then arrange themselves into two classes: (1) those with a
  common sensitivity to the data error and (2) those failing to achieve this sensitivity
  and that therefore vanish. Since the critical value is determined adaptively during
  training, pruningin the sense of setting weights to exact zerosbecomes an automatic
  consequence of regularization alone. The count of free parameters is also reduced
  automatically as weights are pruned. A comparison is made with results of MacKay
  using the evidence framework and a gaussian regularizer.'
