paperAbstract: 'We describe and evaluate experimentally a method for clustering words
  according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts. Words are represented
  by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative
  entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering.
  Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given
  words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the
  clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic
  annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter
  increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical
  "soft" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of
  word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data.'
