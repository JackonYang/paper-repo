paperAbstract: "Abstract Most known learning algorithms for dynamic neural networks\
  \ in non-stationary environments need global computations to perform credit assignment.\
  \ These algorithms either are not local in time or not local in space. Those algorithms\
  \ which are local in both time and space usually cannot deal sensibly with \u2018\
  hidden units\u2019. In contrast, as far as we can judge, learning rules in biological\
  \ systems with many \u2018hidden units\u2019 are local in both space and time. In\
  \ this paper we propose a parallel on-line learning algorithms which performs local\
  \ computations only, yet still is designed to deal with hidden units and with units\
  \ whose past activations are \u2018hidden in time\u2019. The approach is inspired\
  \ by Holland's idea of the bucket brigade for classifier systems, which is transformed\
  \ to run on a neural network with fixed topology. The result is a feedforward or\
  \ recurrent \u2018neural\u2019 dissipative system which is consuming \u2018weight-substance\u2019\
  \ and permanently trying to distribute this substance onto its connections in an\
  \ ap..."
