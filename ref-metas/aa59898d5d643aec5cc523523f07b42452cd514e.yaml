paperAbstract: A new method of approximation for order-disorder phenomena is developed.
  In Sec. A, the method is explained for the one-dimensional Ising lattice. Sections
  B and C cover the approximations already known, such as those of Bethe (Sec. B)
  and of Kramers-Wannier (Sec. C), which are shown to be derived as special cases
  of the method with suitable choices of variables. In Sec. D, an improved treatment
  is explained for the three-dimensional simple cubic Ising lattice. This approximation
  is found to agree with the rigorous expansion of the partition function up to the
  fourth moment by Kirkwood's moment method, so far as the disordered state is concerned.
  In Sec. E the general formula for the entropy is given. In Sec. H an improved treatment
  of the face-centered lattice (Ising model) is given.
