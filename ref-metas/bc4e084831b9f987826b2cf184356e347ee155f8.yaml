paperAbstract: In this paper, we analyze the activity of single fibers in the optic
  nerve of a frog. Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest
  activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus
  such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It
  has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods
  and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that
  for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather
  the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are
  four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each
  type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are
  four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain
  about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination.
  We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the
  channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only
  to the frog.
