paperAbstract: Directed graphical models with one layer of observed random variables
  and one or more layers of hidden random variables have been the dominant modelling
  paradigm in many research fields. Although this approach has met with considerable
  success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the
  posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative
  two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected
  models. Inference in these "exponential family harmoniums" is fast while learning
  is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then
  studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments
  it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant
  solution to searching with keywords.
