paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose an efficient text detection method based
  on the Laplacian operator. The maximum gradient difference value is computed for
  each pixel in the Laplacian-filtered image. K-means is then used to classify all
  the pixels into two clusters: text and non-text. For each candidate text region,
  the corresponding region in the Sobel edge map of the input image undergoes projection
  profile analysis to determine the boundary of the text blocks. Finally, we employ
  empirical rules to eliminate false positives based on geometrical properties. Experimental
  results show that the proposed method is able to detect text of different fonts,
  contrast and backgrounds. Moreover, it outperforms three existing methods in terms
  of detection and false positive rates.'
