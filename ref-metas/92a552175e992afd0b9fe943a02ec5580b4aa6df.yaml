paperAbstract: Consideration is given to the problem of classifying a test textured
  image that is obtained from one of C possible parent texture classes, after possibly
  applying unknown rotation and scale changes to the parent texture. The training
  texture images (parent classes) are modeled by Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs).
  To classify a rotated and scaled test texture, the rotation and scale changes are
  incorporated in the texture model through an appropriate transformation of the power
  spectral density of the GMRF. For the rotated and scaled image, a bona fide likelihood
  function that shows the explicit dependence of the likelihood function on the GMRF
  parameters, as well as on the rotation and scale parameters, is derived. Although,
  in general, the scaled and/or rotated texture does not correspond to a finite-order
  GMRF, it is possible nonetheless to write down a likelihood function for the image
  data. The likelihood function of the discrete Fourier transform of the image data
  corresponds to that of a white nonstationary Gaussian random field, with the variance
  at each pixel (i,j) being a known function of the rotation, the scale, the GMRF
  model parameters, and (i,j). The variance is an explicit function of the appropriately
  sampled power spectral density of the GMRF. The estimation of the rotation and scale
  parameters is performed in the frequency domain by maximizing the likelihood function
  associated with the discrete Fourier transform of the image data. Cramer-Rao error
  bounds on the scale and rotation estimates are easily computed. A modified Bayes
  decision rule is used to classify a given test image into one of C possible texture
  classes. The classification power of the method is demonstrated through experimental
  results on natural textures from the Brodatz album. >
