paperAbstract: The problem of recognizing mathematical expressions differs significantly
  from the recognition of standard prose. While in prose significant constraints can
  be put on the interpretation of a character by the characters immediately preceding
  and following it, few such simple constraints are present in a mathematical expression.
  In order to make the problem tractable, effective methods of recognizing mathematical
  expressions will need to put intelligent constraints on the possible interpretations.
  The authors present preliminary results on a system for the recognition of both
  handwritten and typeset mathematical expressions. While previous systems perform
  character recognition out of context, the current system maintains ambiguity of
  the characters until context can be used to disambiguate the interpretation. In
  addition, the system limits the number of potentially valid interpretations by decomposing
  the expressions into a sequence of compatible convex regions. The system uses A-star
  to search for the best possible interpretation of an expression. We provide a new
  lower bound estimate on the cost to goal that improves performance significantly.
