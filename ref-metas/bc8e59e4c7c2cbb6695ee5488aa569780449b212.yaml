paperAbstract: Expert Network (ExpNet) is our new approach to automatic categorization
  and retrieval of natural language texts. We use a training set of texts with expert-assigned
  categories to construct a network which approximately reflects the conditional probabilities
  of categories given a text. The input nodes of the network are words in the training
  texts, the nodes on the intermediate level are the training texts, and the output
  nodes are categories. The links between nodes are computed based on statistics of
  the word distribution and the category distribution over the training set. ExpNet
  is used for relevance ranking of candidate categories of an arbitrary text in the
  case of text categorization, and for relevance ranking of documents via categories
  in the case of text retrieval. We have evaluated ExpNet in categorization and retrieval
  on a document collection of the MEDLINE database, and observed a performance in
  recall and precision comparable to the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping method,
  and significantly better than other methods tested. Computationally, ExpNet has
  an O(N 1og N) time complexity which is much more efficient than the cubic complexity
  of the LLSF method. The simplicity of the model, the high recall-precision rates,
  and the efficient computation together make ExpNet preferable as a practical solution
  for real-world applications.
