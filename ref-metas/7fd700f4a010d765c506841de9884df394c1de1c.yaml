paperAbstract: We present a new method for spectral clustering with paired data based
  on kernel canonical correlation analysis, called correlational spectral clustering.
  Paired data are common in real world data sources, such as images with text captions.
  Traditional spectral clustering algorithms either assume that data can be represented
  by a single similarity measure, or by co-occurrence matrices that are then used
  in biclustering. In contrast, the proposed method uses separate similarity measures
  for each data representation, and allows for projection of previously unseen data
  that are only observed in one representation (e.g. images but not text). We show
  that this algorithm generalizes traditional spectral clustering algorithms and show
  consistent empirical improvement over spectral clustering on a variety of datasets
  of images with associated text.
