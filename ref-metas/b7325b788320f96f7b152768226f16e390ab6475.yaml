paperAbstract: This paper describes the COCO-Text dataset. In recent years large-scale
  datasets like SUN and Imagenet drove the advancement of scene understanding and
  object recognition. The goal of COCO-Text is to advance state-of-the-art in text
  detection and recognition in natural images. The dataset is based on the MS COCO
  dataset, which contains images of complex everyday scenes. The images were not collected
  with text in mind and thus contain a broad variety of text instances. To reflect
  the diversity of text in natural scenes, we annotate text with (a) location in terms
  of a bounding box, (b) fine-grained classification into machine printed text and
  handwritten text, (c) classification into legible and illegible text, (d) script
  of the text and (e) transcriptions of legible text. The dataset contains over 173k
  text annotations in over 63k images. We provide a statistical analysis of the accuracy
  of our annotations. In addition, we present an analysis of three leading state-of-the-art
  photo Optical Character Recognition (OCR) approaches on our dataset. While scene
  text detection and recognition enjoys strong advances in recent years, we identify
  significant shortcomings motivating future work.
