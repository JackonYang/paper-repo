paperAbstract: 'We describe an approach for unsupervised learning of a generic, distributed
  sentence encoder. Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder
  model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage.
  Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar
  vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to
  encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary
  to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors
  with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence
  ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity
  datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic
  sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice.'
