paperAbstract: "We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature\
  \ detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face\
  \ detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder\
  \ on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset\
  \ has 10 million 200\xD7200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train\
  \ this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000\
  \ machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held\
  \ intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face\
  \ detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments\
  \ show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to\
  \ scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive\
  \ to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from\
  \ these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories\
  \ from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous\
  \ state-of-the-art."
