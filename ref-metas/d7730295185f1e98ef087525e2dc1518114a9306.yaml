paperAbstract: "A simple algorithm for computing the three-dimensional structure of\
  \ a scene from a correlated pair of perspective projections is described here, when\
  \ the spatial relationship between the two projections is unknown. This problem\
  \ is relevant not only to photographic surveying1 but also to binocular vision2,\
  \ where the non-visual information available to the observer about the orientation\
  \ and focal length of each eye is much less accurate than the optical information\
  \ supplied by the retinal images themselves. The problem also arises in monocular\
  \ perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated\
  \ in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images\
  \ to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment\
  \ of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018\
  correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for\
  \ determining the distances of visible elements in the scene. I shall assume that\
  \ the correspondence problem has been solved; the problem of reconstructing the\
  \ scene then reduces to that of finding the relative orientation of the two viewpoints."
