paperAbstract: This paper addresses the novel problem of automatically synthesizing
  an output image from a large collection of different input images. The synthesized
  image, called a digital tapestry, can be viewed as a visual summary or a virtual
  'thumbnail' of all the images in the input collection. The problem of creating the
  tapestry is cast as a multi-class labeling problem such that each region in the
  tapestry is constructed from input image blocks that are salient and such that neighboring
  blocks satisfy spatial compatibility. This is formulated using a Markov random field
  and optimized via the graph cut based expansion move algorithm. The standard expansion
  move algorithm can only handle energies with metric terms, while our energy contains
  non-metric (soft and hard) constraints. Therefore we propose two novel contributions.
  First, we extend the expansion move algorithm for energy functions with non-metric
  hard constraints. Secondly, we modify it for functions with "almost" metric soft
  terms, and show that it gives good results in practice. The proposed framework was
  tested on several consumer photograph collections, and the results are presented.
