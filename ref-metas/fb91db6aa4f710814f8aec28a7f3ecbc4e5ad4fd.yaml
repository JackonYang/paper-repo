paperAbstract: 'Our proposed deeply-supervised nets (DSN) method simultaneously minimizes
  classification error while making the learning process of hidden layers direct and
  transparent. We make an attempt to boost the classification performance by studying
  a new formulation in deep networks. Three aspects in convolutional neural networks
  (CNN) style architectures are being looked at: (1) transparency of the intermediate
  layers to the overall classification; (2) discriminativeness and robustness of learned
  features, especially in the early layers; (3) effectiveness in training due to the
  presence of the exploding and vanishing gradients. We introduce "companion objective"
  to the individual hidden layers, in addition to the overall objective at the output
  layer (a different strategy to layer-wise pre-training). We extend techniques from
  stochastic gradient methods to analyze our algorithm. The advantage of our method
  is evident and our experimental result on benchmark datasets shows significant performance
  gain over existing methods (e.g. all state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10,
  CIFAR-100, and SVHN).'
