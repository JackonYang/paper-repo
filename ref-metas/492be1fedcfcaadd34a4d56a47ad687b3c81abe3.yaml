paperAbstract: Dynamic programming is discussed as an approach to solving variational
  problems in vision. Dynamic programming ensures global optimality of the solution,
  is numerically stable, and allows for hard constraints to be enforced on the behavior
  of the solution within a natural and straightforward structure. As a specific example
  of the approach's efficacy, applying dynamic programming to the energy-minimizing
  active contours is described. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multistage
  decision process and is solved by a time-delayed discrete dynamic programming algorithm.
  A parallel procedure for decreasing computational costs is discussed. >
