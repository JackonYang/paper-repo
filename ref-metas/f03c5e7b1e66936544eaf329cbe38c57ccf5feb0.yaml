paperAbstract: A top-down page segmentation technique known as the recursive X-Y cut
  decomposes a document image recursively into a set of rectangular blocks. This paper
  proposes that the recursive X-Y cut be implemented using bounding boxes of connected
  components of black pixels instead of using image pixels. The advantage is that
  great improvement can be achieved in computation. In fact, once bounding boxes of
  connected components are obtained, the recursive X-Y cut is completed within an
  order of a second on Sparc-10 workstations for letter-sized document images scanned
  at 900 dpi resolution.
