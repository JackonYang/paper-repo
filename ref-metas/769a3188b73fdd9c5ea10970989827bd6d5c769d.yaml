paperAbstract: 'The book is mainly concerned with the mathematical foundations of
  Bayesian image analysis and its algorithms. This amounts to the study of Markov
  random fields and dynamic Monte Carlo algorithms like sampling, simulated annealing
  and stochastic gradient algorithms. The approach is introductory and elementary:
  given basic concepts from linear algebra and real analysis it is self-contained.
  No previous knowledge from image analysis is required. Knowledge of elementary probability
  theory and statistics is certainly beneficial but not absolutely necessary. The
  necessary background from imaging is sketched and illustrated by a number of concrete
  applications like restoration, texture segmentation and motion analysis.'
