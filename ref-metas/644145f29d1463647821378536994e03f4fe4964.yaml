paperAbstract: 'When looking at a scene, observers feel that they see its entire structure
  in great detail and can immediately notice any changes in it. However, when brief
  blank fields are placed between alternating displays of an original and a modified
  scene, a striking failure of perception is induced: Identification of changes becomes
  extremely difficult, even when changes are large and made repeatedly. Identification
  is much faster when a verbal cue is provided, showing that poor visibility is not
  the cause of this difficulty. Identification is also faster for objects considered
  to be important in the scene. These results support the idea that observers never
  form a complete, detailed representation of their surroundings. In addition, the
  results indicate that attention is required to perceive change, and that in the
  absence of localized motion signals, attention is guided on the basis of high-level
  interest.'
