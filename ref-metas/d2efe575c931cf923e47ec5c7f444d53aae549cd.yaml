paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose techniques to make use of two complementary
  bottom-up features, image edges and texture patches, to guide top-down object segmentation
  towards higher precision. We build upon the part-based pose-let detector, which
  can predict masks for numerous parts of an object. For this purpose we extend poselets
  to 19 other categories apart from person. We non-rigidly align these part detections
  to potential object contours in the image, both to increase the precision of the
  predicted object mask and to sort out false positives. We spatially aggregate object
  information via a variational smoothing technique while ensuring that object regions
  do not overlap. Finally, we propose to refine the segmentation based on self-similarity
  defined on small image patches. We obtain competitive results on the challenging
  Pascal VOC benchmark. On four classes we achieve the best numbers to-date.
