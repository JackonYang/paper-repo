paperAbstract: We present a model for compositional distributional semantics related
  to the framework of Coecke et al. (2010), and emulating formal semantics by representing
  functions as tensors and arguments as vectors. We introduce a new learning method
  for tensors, generalising the approach of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010). We evaluate
  it on two benchmark data sets, and find it to outperform existing leading methods.
  We argue in our analysis that the nature of this learning method also renders it
  suitable for solving more subtle problems compositional distributional models might
  face.
