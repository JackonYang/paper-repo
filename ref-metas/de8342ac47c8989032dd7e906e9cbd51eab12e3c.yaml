paperAbstract: We introduce an approach to accurately detect and segment partially
  occluded objects in various viewpoints and scales. Our main contribution is a novel
  framework for combining object-level descriptions (such as position, shape, and
  color) with pixel-level appearance, boundary, and occlusion reasoning. In training,
  we exploit a rough 3D object model to learn physically localized part appearances.
  To find and segment objects in an image, we generate proposals based on the appearance
  and layout of local parts. The proposals are then refined after incorporating object-level
  information, and overlapping objects compete for pixels to produce a final description
  and segmentation of objects in the scene. A further contribution is a novel instance
  penalty, which is handled very efficiently during inference. We experimentally validate
  our approach on the challenging PASCAL'06 car database.
