paperAbstract: We analyze algorithms that predict a binary value by combining the
  predictions of several prediction strategies, called `experts''. Our analysis is
  for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence
  of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm
  by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence
  and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where
  the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We
  show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of
  the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that
  achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most
  cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning
  algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known
  in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used
  instead of the expected number of mistakes.
