paperAbstract: "In the real world, a realistic setting for computer vision or multimedia\
  \ recognition problems is that we have some classes containing lots of training\
  \ data and many classes contain a small amount of training data. Therefore, how\
  \ to use frequent classes to help learning rare classes for which it is harder to\
  \ collect the training data is an open question. Learning with Shared Information\
  \ is an emerging topic in machine learning, computer vision and multimedia analysis.\
  \ There are different level of components that can be shared during concept modeling\
  \ and machine learning stages, such as sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes,\
  \ sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training\
  \ examples, etc. Regarding the specific methods, multi-task learning, transfer learning\
  \ and deep learning can be seen as using different strategies to share information.\
  \ These learning with shared information methods are very effective in solving real-world\
  \ large-scale problems. This special issue aims at gathering the recent advances\
  \ in learning with shared information methods and their applications in computer\
  \ vision and multimedia analysis. Both state-of-the-art works, as well as literature\
  \ reviews, are welcome for submission. Papers addressing interesting real-world\
  \ computer vision and multimedia applications are especially encouraged. Topics\
  \ of interest include, but are not limited to:  \u2022 Multi-task learning or transfer\
  \ learning for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Deep learning\
  \ for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Multi-modal approach\
  \ for large-scale computer vision and multimedia analysis \u2022 Different sharing\
  \ strategies, e.g., sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations,\
  \ sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, \u2022 Real-world\
  \ computer vision and multimedia applications based on learning with shared information,\
  \ e.g., event detection, object recognition, object detection, action recognition,\
  \ human head pose estimation, object tracking, location-based services, semantic\
  \ indexing. \u2022 New datasets and metrics to evaluate the benefit of the proposed\
  \ sharing ability for the specific computer vision or multimedia problem. \u2022\
  \ Survey papers regarding the topic of learning with shared information.  Authors\
  \ who are unsure whether their planned submission is in scope may contact the guest\
  \ editors prior to the submission deadline with an abstract, in order to receive\
  \ feedback."
