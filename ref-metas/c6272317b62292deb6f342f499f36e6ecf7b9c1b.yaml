paperAbstract: We present an omnifont, unlimited-vocabulary OCR system for English
  and Arabic. The system is based on hidden Markov models (HMM), an approach that
  has proven to be very successful in the area of automatic speech recognition. We
  focus on two aspects of the OCR system. First, we address the issue of how to perform
  OCR on omnifont and multi-style data, such as plain and italic, without the need
  to have a separate model for each style. The amount of training data from each style,
  which is used to train a single model, becomes an important issue in the face of
  the conditional independence assumption inherent in the use of HMMs. We demonstrate
  mathematically and empirically how to allocate training data among the different
  styles to alleviate this problem. Second, we show how to use a word-based HMM system
  to perform character recognition with unlimited vocabulary. The method includes
  the use of a trigram language model on character sequences. Using all these techniques,
  we have achieved character error rates of 1.1 percent on data from the University
  of Washington English Document Image Database and 3.3 percent on data from the DARPA
  Arabic OCR Corpus.
