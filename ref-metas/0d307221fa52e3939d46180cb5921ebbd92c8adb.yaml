paperAbstract: 'We present a method for spotting words in the wild, i.e., in real
  images taken in unconstrained environments. Text found in the wild has a surprising
  range of difficulty. At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
  applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful
  applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs
  - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks
  involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely
  challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans
  this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on
  state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object
  categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines
  - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust
  Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the
  Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating
  the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem.'
