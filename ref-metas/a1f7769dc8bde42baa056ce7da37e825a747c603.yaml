paperAbstract: 'This paper describes a technique that we believe can be of great help
  in many text-processing situations, and reports on an experiment recently conducted
  to test its validity and scope. As a background we shall present in the following
  sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization
  and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would
  be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing
  projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important
  and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand,
  no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive
  text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language.
  Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at
  least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid
  the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization
  of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects.
  (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this
  paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally
  into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat
  unexpected shift from "lemmatization" to "disambiguation" will be justified in the
  sections to come.) Based on'
