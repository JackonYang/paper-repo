paperAbstract: A procedure that processes a corpus of text and produces numeric vectors
  containing information about its meanings for each word is presented. This procedure
  is applied to a large corpus of natural language text taken from Usenet, and the
  resulting vectors are examined to determine what information is contained within
  them. These vectors provide the coordinates in a high-dimensional space in which
  word relationships can be analyzed. Analyses of both vector similarity and multidimensional
  scaling demonstrate that there is significant semantic information carried in the
  vectors. A comparison of vector similarity with human reaction times in a single-word
  priming experiment is presented. These vectors provide the basis for a representational
  model of semantic memory, hyperspace analogue to language (HAL).
