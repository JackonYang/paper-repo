paperAbstract: Bottom-up segmentation based only on low-level cues is a notoriously
  difficult problem. This difficulty has lead to recent top-down segmentation algorithms
  that are based on class-specific image information. Despite the success of top-down
  algorithms, they often give coarse segmentations that can be significantly refined
  using low-level cues. This raises the question of how to combine both top-down and
  bottom-up cues in a principled manner.In this paper we approach this problem using
  supervised learning. Given a training set of ground truth segmentations we train
  a fragment-based segmentation algorithm which takes into account both bottom-up
  and top-down cues simultaneously, in contrast to most existing algorithms which
  train top-down and bottom-up modules separately. We formulate the problem in the
  framework of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and derive a feature induction algorithm
  for CRF, which allows us to efficiently search over thousands of candidate fragments.
  Whereas pure top-down algorithms often require hundreds of fragments, our simultaneous
  learning procedure yields algorithms with a handful of fragments that are combined
  with low-level cues to efficiently compute high quality segmentations.
