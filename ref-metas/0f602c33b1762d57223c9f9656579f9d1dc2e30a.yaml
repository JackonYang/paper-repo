paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a hierarchical
  representation of visual input that aims to enable recognition and detection of
  a large number of object categories. Inspired by the principles of efficient indexing
  (bottom-up,), robust matching (top-down,), and ideas of compositionality, our approach
  learns a hierarchy of spatially flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an unsupervised,
  statistics-driven manner. Starting with simple, frequent features, we learn the
  statistically most significant compositions (parts composed of parts), which consequently
  define the next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer after layer, optimally
  adjusting to the visual data. Lower layers are learned in a category-independent
  way to obtain complex, yet sharable visual building blocks, which is a crucial step
  towards a scalable representation. Higher layers of the hierarchy, on the other
  hand, are constructed by using specific categories, achieving a category representation
  with a small number of highly generalizable parts that gained their structural flexibility
  through composition within the hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can
  be efficiently and continuously added to the system by adding a small number of
  parts only in the higher layers. The approach is demonstrated on a large collection
  of images and a variety of object categories. Detection results confirm the effectiveness
  and robustness of the learned parts.
