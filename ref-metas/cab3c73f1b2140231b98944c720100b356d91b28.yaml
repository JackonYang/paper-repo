paperAbstract: An algorithm and data structure are presented for searching a file
  containing N records, each described by k real valued keys, for the m closest matches
  or nearest neighbors to a given query record. The computation required to organize
  the file is proportional to kNlogN. The expected number of records examined in each
  search is independent of the file size. The expected computation to perform each
  search is proportional to logN. Empirical evidence suggests that except for very
  small files, this algorithm is considerably faster than other methods.
