paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we present the mQA model, which is able to answer questions
  about the content of an image. The answer can be a sentence, a phrase or a single
  word. Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract
  the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the
  visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an answer,
  and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three components
  and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering
  (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate our mQA model. It contains over 150,000 images
  and 310,000 freestyle Chinese question-answer pairs and their English translations.
  The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated
  by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided
  by humans and our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the
  human. They will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating
  the quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this
  evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges
  cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for
  human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on
  the project page: this http URL'
