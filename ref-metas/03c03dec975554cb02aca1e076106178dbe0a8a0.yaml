paperAbstract: The named entity recognition (NER) task involves identifying noun phrases
  that are names, and assigning a class to each name. This task has its origin from
  the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) in the 1990s, a series of conferences
  aimed at evaluating systems that extract information from natural language texts.
  It became evident that in order to achieve good performance in information extraction,
  a system needs to be able to recognize names. A separate subtask on NER was created
  in MUC-6 and MUC-7 (Chinchor, 1998).
