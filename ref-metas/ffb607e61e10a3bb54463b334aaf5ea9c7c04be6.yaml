paperAbstract: The concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is a way to construct discrete-time
  iterative dynamical systems that are guaranteed to decrease global optimization
  and energy functions monotonically. This procedure can be applied to almost any
  optimization problem, and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of
  it. In particular, we prove that all expectation-maximization algorithms and classes
  of Legendre minimization and variational bounding algorithms can be reexpressed
  in terms of CCCP. We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory
  algorithms are also examples of CCCP. The generalized iterative scaling algorithm
  and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables. CCCP
  can be used both as a new way to understand, and prove the convergence of, existing
  optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms.
