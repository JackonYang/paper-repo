paperAbstract: "The system (see Figure 2) uses a neural network, called a \u201Crouter\u201D\
  , to analyze each window of the input before it is processed by a \u201Cdetector\u201D\
  \ network. If the window contains a face, the router returns the angle of the face.\
  \ The window can then be \u201Cderotated\u201D to make the face upright. The derotated\
  \ window is then passed to the detection network, which decides whether a face is\
  \ present. If a non-face image is encountered, the router will return a meaningless\
  \ rotation. Since a rotation of a non-face image will yield another nonface image,\
  \ the detector network will still not detect a face. A rotated face, which would\
  \ not have been detected by an upright face detector, will be rotated to an upright\
  \ position, and subsequently detected as a face. Because the detector network is\
  \ only applied once at each image location, this approach is significantly faster\
  \ than exhaustively trying all orientations, and will yield fewer false detections\
  \ [ 1,3]. To speed up the above algorithm for demonstration purposes, we used several\
  \ techniques. First, we use a change detection algorithm to restrict the search\
  \ area. Second, we use a model of skin color (acquired online as faces are detected)\
  \ to further restrict the search. Finally, we use a candidate detection network\
  \ to quickly rule out some portions of the input image, before examining them more\
  \ carefully (and slowly) with the detection network. With these techniques, it takes\
  \ about 6 seconds to process a 160x 120 pixel image on an SGI 02 workstation with\
  \ a 174 MHz RIO000 processor."
