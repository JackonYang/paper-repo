paperAbstract: It is shown that from a monocular view of a rigid, textured, curved
  surface it is possible, in principle, to determine the gradient of the surface at
  any point, and the motion of the eye relative to it, from the velocity field of
  the changing retinal image, and its first and second spatial derivatives. The relevant
  equations are redundant, thus providing a test of the rigidity assumption. They
  involve, among other observable quantities, the components of shear of the retinal
  velocity field, suggesting that the visual system may possess specialized channels
  for computing these components.
