paperAbstract: Dimensionality reduction involves mapping a set of high dimensional
  input points onto a low dimensional manifold so that 'similar" points in input space
  are mapped to nearby points on the manifold. We present a method - called Dimensionality
  Reduction by Learning an Invariant Mapping (DrLIM) - for learning a globally coherent
  nonlinear function that maps the data evenly to the output manifold. The learning
  relies solely on neighborhood relationships and does not require any distancemeasure
  in the input space. The method can learn mappings that are invariant to certain
  transformations of the inputs, as is demonstrated with a number of experiments.
  Comparisons are made to other techniques, in particular LLE.
