paperAbstract: 'Perceptual systems routinely separate content from style, classifying
  familiar words spoken in an unfamiliar accent, identifying a font or handwriting
  style across letters, or recognizing a familiar face or object seen under unfamiliar
  viewing conditions. Yet a general and tractable computational model of this ability
  to untangle the underlying factors of perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter,
  1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994;
  Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan,
  Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently
  rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such
  as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning
  algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks
  using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of
  factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms
  based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report
  promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains:
  spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation
  of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants.'
