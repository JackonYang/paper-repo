paperAbstract: Object recognition has reached a level where we can identify a large
  number of previously seen and known objects. However, the more challenging and important
  task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally,
  contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization
  requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand,
  have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little
  work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative
  capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we
  present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization.
  It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories,
  for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance
  and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate
  combination of different methods.
