paperAbstract: A robot that can carry out a natural-language instruction has been
  a dream since before the Jetsons cartoon series imagined a life of leisure mediated
  by a fleet of attentive robot helpers. It is a dream that remains stubbornly distant.
  However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made incredible progress
  in closely related areas. This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language
  navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and
  language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering. Both tasks can be
  interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and
  many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application
  of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded
  navigation instructions, we present the Matter-port3D Simulator - a large-scale
  reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery [11]. Using this simulator,
  which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide
  the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in
  real buildings - the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset1.
