paperAbstract: Many scientific fields study data with an underlying structure that
  is non-Euclidean. Some examples include social networks in computational social
  sciences, sensor networks in communications, functional networks in brain imaging,
  regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. In many
  applications, such geometric data are large and complex (in the case of social networks,
  on the scale of billions) and are natural targets for machine-learning techniques.
  In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven
  to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural-language
  processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on
  data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure and in cases where the
  invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them.
