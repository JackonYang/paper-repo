paperAbstract: "A recognition scheme that scales efficiently to a large number of\
  \ objects is presented. The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration\
  \ that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019\
  s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from\
  \ local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region\
  \ descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary\
  \ tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently,\
  \ which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality.\
  \ The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines\
  \ the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated,\
  \ essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through\
  \ retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary\
  \ tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."
