paperAbstract: "Chapters 2\u20137 make up Part II of the book: artificial neural networks.\
  \ After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning\
  \ rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise,\
  \ for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network\
  \ types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization\
  \ and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models.\
  \ Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian\
  \ learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization.\
  \ Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and\
  \ especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks,\
  \ radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement\
  \ learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an\
  \ in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy,\
  \ complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active\
  \ learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques\
  \ and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts\
  \ in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently\
  \ used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms,\
  \ genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential\
  \ evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation,\
  \ operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary\
  \ computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16\
  \ and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection\
  \ of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It\
  \ illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary\
  \ computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are\
  \ discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing\
  \ work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies.\
  \ Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from\
  \ fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic\
  \ terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field\
  \ are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness\
  \ and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest\
  \ concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate\
  \ students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering\
  \ such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at\
  \ a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who\
  \ wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for\
  \ an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence. Learning\
  \ with Kernels: Support Vector Machines, Regularization, Optimization, and Beyond\u2014\
