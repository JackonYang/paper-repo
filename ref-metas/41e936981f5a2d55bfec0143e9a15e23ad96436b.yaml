paperAbstract: 'Information extraction systems usually require two dictionaries: a
  semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns for the domain. We present
  a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and
  extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated
  training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping
  technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and
  bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting
  the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second
  level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon
  entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated
  this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and
  a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries
  for several semantic categories.'
