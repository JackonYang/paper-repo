paperAbstract: Automatically assigning keywords to images is of great interest as
  it allows one to index, retrieve, and understand large collections of image data.
  Many techniques have been proposed for image annotation in the last decade that
  give reasonable performance on standard datasets. However, most of these works fail
  to compare their methods with simple baseline techniques to justify the need for
  complex models and subsequent training. In this work, we introduce a new baseline
  technique for image annotation that treats annotation as a retrieval problem. The
  proposed technique utilizes low-level image features and a simple combination of
  basic distances to find nearest neighbors of a given image. The keywords are then
  assigned using a greedy label transfer mechanism. The proposed baseline outperforms
  the current state-of-the-art methods on two standard and one large Web dataset.
  We believe that such a baseline measure will provide a strong platform to compare
  and better understand future annotation techniques.
