paperAbstract: A multiple resolution algorithm is presented for segmenting images
  into regions with differing statistical behavior. In addition, an algorithm is developed
  for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating
  the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive
  model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures.
  Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation.
  The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution
  and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified.
  This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation
  than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each
  pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution
  is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject
  to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is
  maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification
  of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm
  determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global
  criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the
  individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters
  and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct
  textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is
  reached. >
