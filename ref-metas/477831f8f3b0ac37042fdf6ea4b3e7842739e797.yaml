paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we present a new approach for analysis of images for
  text-localization and extraction. Our approach puts very few constraints on the
  font, size and color of text and is capable of handling both scene text and artificial
  text well. In this paper, we exploit two well-known features of text: approximately
  constant stroke width and local contrast, and develop a fast, simple, and effective
  algorithm to detect character strokes. We also show how these can be used for accurate
  extraction and motivate some advantages of using this approach for text localization
  over other color-space segmentation based approaches. We analyze the performance
  of our stroke detection algorithm on images collected for the robust-reading competitions
  at ICDAR 2003.'
