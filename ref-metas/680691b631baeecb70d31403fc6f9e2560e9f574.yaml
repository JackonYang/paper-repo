paperAbstract: Page segmentation into text and non-text elements is an essential preprocessing
  step before optical character recognition (OCR) operation. In case of poor segmentation,
  an OCR classification engine produces garbage characters due to the presence of
  non-text elements. This paper describes modifications to the text/non-text segmentation
  algorithm presented by Bloomberg,1 which is also available in his open-source Leptonica
  library.2The modifications result in significant improvements and achieved better
  segmentation accuracy than the original algorithm for UW-III, UNLV, ICDAR 2009 page
  segmentation competition test images and circuit diagram datasets.
