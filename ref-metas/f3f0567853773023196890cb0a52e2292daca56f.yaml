paperAbstract: Many computer vision applications rely on the efficient optimization
  of challenging, so-called non-submodular, binary pairwise MRFs. A promising graph
  cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs known as "roof duality" was recently
  introduced into computer vision. We study two methods which extend this approach.
  First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the "probing" technique introduced
  recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global
  optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the
  work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary
  input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations
  of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications,
  including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition,
  parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications
  we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably
  outperform the original roof duality approach. In comparison to existing techniques,
  such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and simulated annealing, we nearly always find
  a lower energy.
