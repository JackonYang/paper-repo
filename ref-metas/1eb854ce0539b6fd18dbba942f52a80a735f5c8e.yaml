paperAbstract: Efficient content-based retrieval of image and video databases is an
  important application due to rapid proliferation of digital video data on the Internet
  and corporate intranets. Text either embedded or superimposed within video frames
  is very useful for describing the contents of the frames, as it enables both keyword
  and free-text based search, automatic video logging, and video cataloging. We have
  developed a scheme for automatically extracting text from digital images and videos
  for content annotation and retrieval. We present our approach to robust text extraction
  from video frames, which can handle complex image backgrounds, deal with different
  font sizes, font styles, and font appearances such as normal and inverse video.
  Our algorithm results in segmented characters that can be directly processed by
  an OCR system to produce ASCII text. Results from our experiments with over 5000
  frames obtained from twelve MPEG video streams demonstrate the good performance
  of our system in terms of text identification accuracy and computational efficiency.
