paperAbstract: "The problem of tracking curves in dense visual clutter is challenging.\
  \ Kalman filtering is inadequate because it is based on Gaussian densities which,\
  \ being unimo dal, cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. The Condensation\
  \ algorithm uses \u201Cfactored sampling\u201D, previously applied to the interpretation\
  \ of static images, in which the probability distribution of possible interpretations\
  \ is represented by a randomly generated set. Condensation uses learned dynamical\
  \ models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time.\
  \ The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion. Notwithstanding the use\
  \ of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."
