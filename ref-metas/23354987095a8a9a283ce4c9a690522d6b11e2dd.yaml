paperAbstract: The proliferation of topic hierarchies for text documents has resulted
  in a need for tools that automatically classify new documents within such hierarchies.
  One can use existing classifiers by ignoring the hierarchical structure, treating
  the topics as separate classes. Unfortunately, in the context of text categorization,
  we are faced with a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features
  needed to distinguish between them. Consequently, we are restricted to using only
  very simple classifiers, both because of computational cost and the tendency of
  complex models to overfit. We propose an approach that utilizes the hierarchical
  topic structure to decompose the classification task into a set of simpler problems,
  one at each node in the classification tree. As we show, each of these smaller problems
  can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very small set of features, those
  relevant to the task at hand. This set of relevant features varies widely throughout
  the hierarchy, so that, while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each
  classifier only examines a small subset. The use of reduced feature sets allows
  us to utilize more complex (probabilistic) models, without encountering the computational
  and robustness difficulties described above.
