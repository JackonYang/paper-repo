paperAbstract: We investigate the challenge of extracting information about genetic
  mutations from tables, an important source of information in scientific papers.
  We use various machine learning algorithms and feature sets, and evaluate performance
  in extracting fields associated with an existing handcreated database of mutations.
  We then show how classifying tabular information can be leveraged for the task of
  named entity detection for mutations.
