paperAbstract: In the past several years, a number of different language modeling
  improvements over simple trigram models have been found, including caching, higher-order
  n -grams, skipping, interpolated Kneser?Ney smoothing, and clustering. We present
  explorations of variations on, or of the limits of, each of these techniques, including
  showing that sentence mixture models may have more potential. While all of these
  techniques have been studied separately, they have rarely been studied in combination.
  We compare a combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model
  with no count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38 and 50% (1 bit
  of entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate reduction
  of 8.9%. Our perplexity reductions are perhaps the highest reported compared to
  a fair baseline.
