paperAbstract: An efficient and intuitive algorithm is presented for the design of
  vector quantizers based either on a known probabilistic model or on a long training
  sequence of data. The basic properties of the algorithm are discussed and demonstrated
  by examples. Quite general distortion measures and long blocklengths are allowed,
  as exemplified by the design of parameter vector quantizers of ten-dimensional vectors
  arising in Linear Predictive Coded (LPC) speech compression with a complicated distortion
  measure arising in LPC analysis that does not depend only on the error vector.
