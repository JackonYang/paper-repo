paperAbstract: We propose a method to learn heterogeneous models of object classes
  for visual recognition. The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and
  learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations
  of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a join
  probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance
  of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training
  set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization.
  When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects,
  each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views.
  Similarly, different component models can also "specialize" on sub-classes of an
  object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species
  of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety
  of objects.
