paperAbstract: Learning algorithms have been used both on feed-forward deterministic
  networks and on feed-back statistical networks to capture input-output relations
  and do pattern classification. These learning algorithms are examined for a class
  of problems characterized by noisy or statistical data, in which the networks learn
  the relation between input data and probability distributions of answers. In simple
  but nontrivial networks the two learning rules are closely related. Under some circumstances
  the learning problem for the statistical networks can be solved without Monte Carlo
  procedures. The usual arbitrary learning goals of feed-forward networks can be given
  useful probabilistic meaning.
