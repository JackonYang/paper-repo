paperAbstract: "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in end-to-end speech\
  \ recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined alignments.\
  \ One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns a mapping\
  \ between variable-length input and output sequences in one step using a purely\
  \ data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to improve the performance\
  \ over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC),\
  \ mainly because it explicitly uses the history of the target character without\
  \ any conditional independence assumptions. However, we observed that the performance\
  \ of the attention has shown poor results in noisy condition and is hard to learn\
  \ in the initial training stage with long input sequences. This is because the attention\
  \ model is too flexible to predict proper alignments in such cases due to the lack\
  \ of left-to-right constraints as used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method\
  \ for end-to-end speech recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence\
  \ by using a joint CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework,\
  \ thereby mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks\
  \ demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder\
  \ baselines, showing 5.4\u201314.6% relative improvements in Character Error Rate\
  \ (CER)."
