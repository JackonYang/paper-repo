paperAbstract: 'We study an energy functional for computing optical flow that combines
  three assumptions: a brightness constancy assumption, a gradient constancy assumption,
  and a discontinuity-preserving spatio-temporal smoothness constraint. In order to
  allow for large displacements, linearisations in the two data terms are strictly
  avoided. We present a consistent numerical scheme based on two nested fixed point
  iterations. By proving that this scheme implements a coarse-to-fine warping strategy,
  we give a theoretical foundation for warping which has been used on a mainly experimental
  basis so far. Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel method gives significantly
  smaller angular errors than previous techniques for optical flow estimation. We
  show that it is fairly insensitive to parameter variations, and we demonstrate its
  excellent robustness under noise.'
