paperAbstract: In this paper we describe the algorithmic implementation of multiclass
  kernel-based vector machines. Our starting point is a generalized notion of the
  margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization
  problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function.
  Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem
  into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields
  a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization
  problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and
  decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size.
  We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization
  problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield
  significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various
  experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods.
  Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art
  accuracy.
