paperAbstract: The Method of path coefficients was suggested a number of years ago
  (Wright 1918, more fully 1920, 1921), as a flexible means of relating the correlation
  coefficients between variables in a multiple system to the functional relations
  among them. The method has been applied in quite a variety of cases. It seems desirable
  now to make a restatement of the theory and to review the types of application,
  especially as there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding both of purpose
  and of procedure.
