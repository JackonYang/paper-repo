paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThis book takes an empirical approach to language\
  \ processing, based on applying statistical and other machine-learning algorithms\
  \ to large corpora.Methodology boxes are included in each chapter. Each chapter\
  \ is built around one or more worked examples to demonstrate the main idea of the\
  \ chapter. Covers the fundamental algorithms of various fields, whether originally\
  \ proposed for spoken or written language to demonstrate how the same algorithm\
  \ can be used for speech recognition and word-sense disambiguation. Emphasis on\
  \ web and other practical applications. Emphasis on scientific evaluation. Useful\
  \ as a reference for professionals in any of the areas of speech and language processing."
