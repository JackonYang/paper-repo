paperAbstract: 'The main factors limiting the performance of the peripheral parts
  of the visual system can be specified, and doing this clarifies the nature of the
  interpretive tasks that must be performed by the central parts of the system. It
  is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving
  power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment,
  and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive
  pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible.
  Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres
  may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to
  the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex,
  for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do
  not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure
  of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts
  the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge
  of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this
  can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the
  diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher
  functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the
  limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual
  tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence much
  of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized.
  But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one
  is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three
  stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical
  map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation
  ; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information
  by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas.'
