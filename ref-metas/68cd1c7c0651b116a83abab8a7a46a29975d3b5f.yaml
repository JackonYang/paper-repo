paperAbstract: Extracting semantic relationships between entities is challenging.
  This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic
  knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM. Our study illustrates
  that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction
  and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while
  additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. This
  suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction
  is shallow and can be captured by chunking. We also demonstrate how semantic information
  such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction
  to further improve the performance. Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective
  incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported
  systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based
  systems by over 20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types.
