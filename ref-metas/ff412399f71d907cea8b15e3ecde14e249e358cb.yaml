paperAbstract: Learning models for detecting and classifying object categories is
  a challenging problem in machine vision. While discriminative approaches to learning
  and classification have, in principle, superior performance, generative approaches
  provide many useful features, one of which is the ability to naturally establish
  explicit correspondence between model components and scene features - this, in turn,
  allows for the handling of missing data and unsupervised learning in clutter. We
  explore a hybrid generative/discriminative approach using 'Fisher kernels' by Jaakkola
  and Haussler (1999) which retains most of the desirable properties of generative
  methods, while increasing the classification performance through a discriminative
  setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this kernel framework can be used to combine
  different types of features and models into a single classifier. Our experiments,
  conducted on a number of popular benchmarks, show strong performance improvements
  over the corresponding generative approach and are competitive with the best results
  reported in the literature.
