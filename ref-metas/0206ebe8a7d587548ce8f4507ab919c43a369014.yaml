paperAbstract: Pictorial structure (PS) models are extensively used for part-based
  recognition of scenes, people, animals and multi-part objects. To achieve tractability,
  the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example,
  by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions.
  These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data.
  On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel
  density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts
  of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines
  the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric
  methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates
  from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent
  pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity
  and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars
  for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human
  figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset
  [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars.
