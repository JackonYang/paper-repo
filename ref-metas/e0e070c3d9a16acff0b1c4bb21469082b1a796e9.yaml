paperAbstract: The striate cortex transforms the topographic representation of visual
  space in the lateral geniculate body into a Fourier transform or frequency representation
  at the complex cell level via the intermediary simple cell stage of "strip integration."
  Each of these three stages contains essentially the same amount of information,
  which expresses a conservation of information principle; however, the form of the
  information is changed. In the transform domain, invariant descriptions of visual
  objects can be derived to serve as the basic sets required for pattern recognition
  and memory. We believe that our experimental and theoretical findings are fundamental
  for understanding the functional organization of the striate cortex.
