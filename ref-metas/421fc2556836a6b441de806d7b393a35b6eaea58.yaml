paperAbstract: 'Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks
  have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning
  to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have
  been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences,
  subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal
  states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding
  which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have
  the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of
  words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are
  contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different
  embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation
  against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream
  tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the
  previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work
  on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new
  state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CoNLL03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained
  language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable
  reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to
  other tasks: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair'
