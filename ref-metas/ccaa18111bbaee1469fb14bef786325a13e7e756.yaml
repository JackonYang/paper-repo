paperAbstract: It is now understood that the turbo decoding algorithm is an instance
  of a probability propagation algorithm (PPA) on a graph with many cycles. In this
  paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as
  the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local
  kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was
  also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall
  generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden
  variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision.
  (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume
  3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize.
