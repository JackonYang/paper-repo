paperAbstract: We develop an object classification method that can learn a novel class
  from a single training example. In this method, experience with already learned
  classes is used to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Our classification
  scheme employs features that discriminate between class and non-class images. For
  a novel class, new features are derived by selecting features that proved useful
  for already learned classification tasks, and adapting these features to the new
  classification task. This adaptation is performed by replacing the features from
  already learned classes with similar features taken from the novel class. A single
  example of a novel class is sufficient to perform feature adaptation and achieve
  useful classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
  can learn a novel class from a single training example, using 10 additional familiar
  classes. The performance is significantly improved compared to using no feature
  adaptation. The robustness of the proposed feature adaptation concept is demonstrated
  by similar performance gains across 107 widely varying object categories.
