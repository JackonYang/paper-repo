paperAbstract: 'Because of their superior ability to preserve sequence information
  over time, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network
  with a more complex computational unit, have obtained strong results on a variety
  of sequence modeling tasks. The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored
  so far is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties
  that would naturally combine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization
  of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing
  systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness
  of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment
  Treebank).'
