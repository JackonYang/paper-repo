paperAbstract: This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying
  reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The classification
  of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the
  review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation
  when it has good associations (e.g., "subtle nuances") and a negative semantic orientation
  when it has bad associations (e.g., "very cavalier"). In this paper, the semantic
  orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given
  phrase and the word "excellent" minus the mutual information between the given phrase
  and the word "poor". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic
  orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy
  of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different
  domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy
  ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
