paperAbstract: In several applications the information is naturally represented by
  graphs. Traditional approaches cope with graphical data structures using a preprocessing
  phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors. However, in this way,
  important topological information may be lost and the achieved results may heavily
  depend on the preprocessing stage. This paper presents a new neural model, called
  graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends
  recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds
  of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs. A learning
  algorithm for GNNs is proposed and some experiments are discussed which assess the
  properties of the model.
