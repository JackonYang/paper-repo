paperAbstract: A time-delay neural network (TDNN) for phoneme recognition is discussed.
  By the use of two hidden layers in addition to an input and output layer it is capable
  of representing complex nonlinear decision surfaces. Three important properties
  of the TDNNs have been observed. First, it was able to invent without human interference
  meaningful linguistic abstractions in time and frequency such as formant tracking
  and segmentation. Second, it has learned to form alternate representations linking
  different acoustic events with the same higher level concept. In this fashion it
  can implement trading relations between lower level acoustic events leading to robust
  recognition performance despite considerable variability in the input speech. Third,
  the network is translation-invariant and does not rely on precise alignment or segmentation
  of the input. The TDNNs performance is compared with the best of hidden Markov models
  (HMMs) on a speaker-dependent phoneme-recognition task. The TDNN achieved a recognition
  of 98.5% compared to 93.7% for the HMM, i.e., a fourfold reduction in error.<<ETX>>
