paperAbstract: A surface spline is a mathematical tool for interpolating a function
  of two variables. It is based upon the small deflection equation of an infinite
  plate. The surface spline depends upon the solution of a system of linear equations,
  and thus, will ordinarily require the use of a digital computer. The closed form
  solution involves no functions more complicated than logarithms, and is easily coded.
  Several modifications which can be incorporated are discussed.
