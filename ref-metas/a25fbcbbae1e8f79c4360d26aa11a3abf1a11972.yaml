paperAbstract: A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms
  is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have
  the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption
  may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain
  of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest,
  where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different
  data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would
  greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling
  efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework
  to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current
  progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.
  In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other
  related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning
  and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential
  future issues in transfer learning research.
