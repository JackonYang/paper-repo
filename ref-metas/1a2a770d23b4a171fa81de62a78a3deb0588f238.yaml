paperAbstract: 'Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive
  classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However
  there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be
  improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization
  technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and
  the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations
  allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet
  classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance
  contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes
  well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly
  beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.'
