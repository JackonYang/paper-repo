paperAbstract: "Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over\
  \ their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many \"plausible\"\
  \ ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one\
  \ that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually\
  \ tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other\
  \ applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic\
  \ way for users to indicate what they consider \"similar.\" For instance, we may\
  \ ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given\
  \ examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \u211Dn,\
  \ learns a distance metric over \u211Dn that respects these relationships. Our method\
  \ is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows\
  \ us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically\
  \ that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance."
