paperAbstract: "Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation\
  \ (MT) problems using neural networks and has exhibited promising results in recent\
  \ years. However, most of the existing NMT models are shallow and there is still\
  \ a performance gap between a single NMT model and the best conventional MT system.\
  \ In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, named fast-forward\
  \ connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an interleaved\
  \ bi-directional architecture for stacking the LSTM layers. Fast-forward connections\
  \ play an essential role in propagating the gradients and building a deep topology\
  \ of depth 16. On the WMT\u201914 English-to-French task, we achieve BLEU=37.7 with\
  \ a single attention model, which outperforms the corresponding single shallow model\
  \ by 6.2 BLEU points. This is the first time that a single NMT model achieves state-of-the-art\
  \ performance and outperforms the best conventional model by 0.7 BLEU points. We\
  \ can still achieve BLEU=36.3 even without using an attention mechanism. After special\
  \ handling of unknown words and model ensembling, we obtain the best score reported\
  \ to date on this task with BLEU=40.4. Our models are also validated on the more\
  \ difficult WMT\u201914 English-to-German task."
