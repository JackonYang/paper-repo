paperAbstract: 'Learning to predict future images from a video sequence involves the
  construction of an internal representation that models the image evolution accurately,
  and therefore, to some degree, its content and dynamics. This is why pixel-space
  video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning.
  In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision
  for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision
  applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that
  does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work,
  we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence.
  To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared
  Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature
  learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method,
  and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different
  published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset'
