paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Given a sequence of independent identically distributed
  random variables with a common probability density function, the problem of the
  estimation of a probability density function and of determining the mode of a probability
  function are discussed. Only estimates which are consistent and asymptotically normal
  are constructed. (Author)'
