paperAbstract: "This paper focuses on a system, WOLFIE (WOrd Learning From Interpreted\
  \ Examples), that acquires a semantic lexicon from a corpus of sentences paired\
  \ with semantic representations. The lexicon learned consists of phrases paired\
  \ with meaning representations. WOLFIE is part of an integrated system that learns\
  \ to transform sentences into representations such as logical database queries.\
  \ \n \nExperimental results are presented demonstrating WOLFIE's ability to learn\
  \ useful lexicons for a database interface in four different natural languages.\
  \ The usefulness of the lexicons learned by WOLFIE are compared to those acquired\
  \ by a similar system, with results favorable to WOLFIE. A second set of experiments\
  \ demonstrates WOLFIE's ability to scale to larger and more difficult, albeit artificially\
  \ generated, corpora. \n \nIn natural language acquisition, it is difficult to gather\
  \ the annotated data needed for supervised learning; however, unannotated data is\
  \ fairly plentiful. Active learning methods attempt to select for annotation and\
  \ training only the most informative examples, and therefore are potentially very\
  \ useful in natural language applications. However, most results to date for active\
  \ learning have only considered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation\
  \ effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to semantic lexicons.\
  \ We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated\
  \ examples required to achieve a given level of performance."
