paperAbstract: The task of 2-D articulated human pose estimation in natural images
  is extremely challenging due to the high level of variation in human appearance.
  These variations arise from different clothing, anatomy, imaging conditions and
  the large number of poses it is possible for a human body to take. Recent work has
  shown state-of-the-art results by partitioning the pose space and using strong nonlinear
  classifiers such that the pose dependence and multi-modal nature of body part appearance
  can be captured. We propose to extend these methods to handle much larger quantities
  of training data, an order of magnitude larger than current datasets, and show how
  to utilize Amazon Mechanical Turk and a latent annotation update scheme to achieve
  high quality annotations at low cost. We demonstrate a significant increase in pose
  estimation accuracy, while simultaneously reducing computational expense by a factor
  of 10, and contribute a dataset of 10,000 highly articulated poses.
