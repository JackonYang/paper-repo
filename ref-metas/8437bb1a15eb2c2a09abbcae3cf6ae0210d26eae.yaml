paperAbstract: 'Certain salient structures in images attract our immediate attention
  without requiring a systematic scan. We present a method for computing saliency
  by a simple iterative scheme, using a uniform network of locally connected processing
  elements. The network uses an optimization approach to produce a ``saliency map,''''''''
  a representation of the image emphasizing salient locations. The main properties
  of the network are: (i) the computations are simple and local, (ii) globally salient
  structures emerge with a small number of iterations, and (iii) as a by-product of
  the computations, contours are smoothed and gaps are filled in.'
