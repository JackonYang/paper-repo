paperAbstract: The Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (NADE) and its real-valued
  version RNADE are competitive density models of multidimensional data across a variety
  of domains. These models use a fixed, arbitrary ordering of the data dimensions.
  One can easily condition on variables at the beginning of the ordering, and marginalize
  out variables at the end of the ordering, however other inference tasks require
  approximate inference. In this work we introduce an efficient procedure to simultaneously
  train a NADE model for each possible ordering of the variables, by sharing parameters
  across all these models. We can thus use the most convenient model for each inference
  task at hand, and ensembles of such models with different orderings are immediately
  available. Moreover, unlike the original NADE, our training procedure scales to
  deep models. Empirically, ensembles of Deep NADE models obtain state of the art
  density estimation performance.
