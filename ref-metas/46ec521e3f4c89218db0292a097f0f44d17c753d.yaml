paperAbstract: "Medial temporal brain regions such as the hippocampal formation and\
  \ parahippocampal cortex have been generally implicated in navigation and visual\
  \ memory. However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear.\
  \ Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex\
  \ is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual\
  \ environment. This region, which we name the \u2018parahippocampal place area\u2019\
  \ (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance\
  \ imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and\
  \ not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the\
  \ presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response\
  \ in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms)\
  \ is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple\
  \ objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to\
  \ arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture\
  \ from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces\
  \ in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We\
  \ propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment."
