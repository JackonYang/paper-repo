paperAbstract: SUMMARY The systematic variation within a set of data, as represented
  by a usual statistical model, may be used to encode the data in a more compact form
  than would be possible if they were considered to be purely random. The encoded
  form has two parts. The first states the inferred estimates of the unknown parameters
  in the model, the second states the data using an optimal code based on the data
  probability distribution implied by those parameter estimates. Choosing the model
  and the estimates that give the most compact coding leads to an interesting general
  inference procedure. In its strict form it has great generality and several nice
  properties but is computationally infeasible. An approximate form is developed and
  its relation to other methods is explored.
