paperAbstract: Table is a commonly used presentation scheme, especially for describing
  relational information. However, table understanding remains an open problem. In
  this paper, we consider the problem of table detection in web documents. Its potential
  applications include web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization
  and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. We describe a machine learning based approach
  to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features
  reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In
  order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed
  a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large
  table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected
  from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out
  of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation
  method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved.
