paperAbstract: "This paper provides evidence that the use of more unlabeled data in\
  \ semi-supervised learning can improve the performance of Natural Language Processing\
  \ (NLP) tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic chunking, and named entity\
  \ recognition. We first propose a simple yet powerful semi-supervised discriminative\
  \ model appropriate for handling large scale unlabeled data. Then, we describe experiments\
  \ performed on widely used test collections, namely, PTB III data, CoNLL\u201900\
  \ and \u201903 shared task data for the above three NLP tasks, respectively. We\
  \ incorporate up to 1G-words (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data, which is the\
  \ largest amount of unlabeled data ever used for these tasks, to investigate the\
  \ performance improvement. In addition, our results are superior to the best reported\
  \ results for all of the above test collections."
