paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nPattern recognition has long been studied in\
  \ relation to many different (and mainly unrelated) applications, such as remote\
  \ sensing, computer vision, space research, and medical imaging. In this book Professor\
  \ Ripley brings together two crucial ideas in pattern recognition; statistical methods\
  \ and machine learning via neural networks. Unifying principles are brought to the\
  \ fore, and the author gives an overview of the state of the subject. Many examples\
  \ are included to illustrate real problems in pattern recognition and how to overcome\
  \ them.This is a self-contained account, ideal both as an introduction for non-specialists\
  \ readers, and also as a handbook for the more expert reader."
