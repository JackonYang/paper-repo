paperAbstract: "Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are\
  \ powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic\
  \ gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient\
  \ descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular\
  \ type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both\
  \ DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance\
  \ that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that\
  \ both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized\
  \ networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform\
  \ markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. \n \nOur success training\
  \ these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural\
  \ networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization\
  \ schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with\
  \ the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without\
  \ the need for sophisticated second-order methods."
