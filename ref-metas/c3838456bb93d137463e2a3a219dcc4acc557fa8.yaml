paperAbstract: A method for the analysis and synthesis of closed curves in the plane
  is developed using the Fourier descriptors FD's of Cosgriff [1]. A curve is represented
  parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction
  of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series
  and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown
  that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions
  of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties
  of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based
  on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost
  arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion
  is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting
  point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors
  as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves
  are generated by computer and plotted out.
