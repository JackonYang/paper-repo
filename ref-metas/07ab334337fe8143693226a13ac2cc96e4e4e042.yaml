paperAbstract: 'Describes some of the document processing techniques used in the RightPages
  electronic library system. Since the system deals with scanned images of document
  pages, these techniques are critical to the use and appearance of the system. The
  author describes three techniques: (1) for noise reduction from binary document
  pages to improve page appearance and subsequent optical character recognition and
  compression; (2) for subsampling the text image to fit on the computer screen white
  maintaining readability; and (3) a document layout analysis technique to determine
  text blocks.<<ETX>>'
