paperAbstract: We present a system that learns to follow navigational natural language
  directions. Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions,
  our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through
  a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the
  text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the
  language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with
  a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from
  the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully
  grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties
  of paths.
