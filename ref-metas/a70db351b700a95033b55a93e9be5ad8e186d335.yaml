paperAbstract: Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities for
  classifying text and non-text components in natural images. They extract a high-level
  feature computed globally from a whole image component (patch), where the cluttered
  background information may dominate true text features in the deep representation.
  This leads to less discriminative power and poorer robustness. In this work, we
  present a new system for scene text detection by proposing a novel Text-Attentional
  Convolutional Neural Network (Text-CNN) that particularly focuses on extracting
  text-related regions and features from the image components. We develop a new learning
  mechanism to train the Text-CNN with multi-level and rich supervised information,
  including text region mask, character label, and binary text/nontext information.
  The rich supervision information enables the Text-CNN with a strong capability for
  discriminating ambiguous texts, and also increases its robustness against complicated
  background components. The training process is formulated as a multi-task learning
  problem, where low-level supervised information greatly facilitates main task of
  text/non-text classification. In addition, a powerful low-level detector called
  Contrast- Enhancement Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (CE-MSERs) is developed,
  which extends the widely-used MSERs by enhancing intensity contrast between text
  patterns and background. This allows it to detect highly challenging text patterns,
  resulting in a higher recall. Our approach achieved promising results on the ICDAR
  2013 dataset, with a F-measure of 0.82, improving the state-of-the-art results substantially.
