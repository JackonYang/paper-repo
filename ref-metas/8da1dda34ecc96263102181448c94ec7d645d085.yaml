paperAbstract: In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions
  of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate
  any continuous function ofn real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only
  mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open
  question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks.
  In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated
  by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer
  and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties
  of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial
  neural networks.
