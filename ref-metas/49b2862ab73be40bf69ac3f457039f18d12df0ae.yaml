paperAbstract: We describe our ongoing efforts at adaptive statistical language modeling.
  Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine
  evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional
  short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution
  is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to
  converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality,
  and its incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements.
  We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood/Maximum
  Entropy (ML/ME) model. Preliminary results with the latter show a 27% perplexity
  reduction as compared to a conventional trigram model.
