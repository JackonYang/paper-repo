paperAbstract: "Traditional relation extraction methods require pre-specified relations\
  \ and relation-specific human-tagged examples. Bootstrapping systems significantly\
  \ reduce the number of training examples, but they usually apply heuristic-based\
  \ methods to combine a set of strict hard rules, which limit the ability to generalize\
  \ and thus generate a low recall. Furthermore, existing bootstrapping methods do\
  \ not perform open information extraction (Open IE), which can identify various\
  \ types of relations without requiring pre-specifications. In this paper, we propose\
  \ a statistical extraction framework called Statistical Snowball (StatSnowball),\
  \ which is a bootstrapping system and can perform both traditional relation extraction\
  \ and Open IE.\n StatSnowball uses the discriminative Markov logic networks (MLNs)\
  \ and softens hard rules by learning their weights in a maximum likelihood estimate\
  \ sense. MLN is a general model, and can be configured to perform different levels\
  \ of relation extraction. In StatSnwoball, pattern selection is performed by solving\
  \ an l1-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation, which enjoys well-founded\
  \ theories and efficient solvers. We extensively evaluate the performance of StatSnowball\
  \ in different configurations on both a small but fully labeled data set and large-scale\
  \ Web data. Empirical results show that StatSnowball can achieve a significantly\
  \ higher recall without sacrificing the high precision during iterations with a\
  \ small number of seeds, and the joint inference of MLN can improve the performance.\
  \ Finally, StatSnowball is efficient and we have developed a working entity relation\
  \ search engine called Renlifang based on it."
