paperAbstract: Many corpus-based natural language processing systems rely on text
  corpora that have been manually annotated with syntactic or semantic tags. In particular,
  all previous dictionary construction systems for information extraction have used
  an annotated training corpus or some form of annotated input. We have developed
  a system called AutoSlog-TS that creates dictionaries of extraction patterns using
  only untagged text. AutoSlog-TS is based on the AutoSlog system, which generated
  extraction patterns using annotated text and a set of heuristic rules. By adapting
  AutoSlog and combining it with statistical techniques, we eliminated its dependency
  on tagged text. In experiments with the MUG-4 terrorism domain, AutoSlog-TS created
  a dictionary of extraction patterns that performed comparably to a dictionary created
  by AutoSlog, using only preclassified texts as input.
