paperAbstract: This paper presents an approach to extract the structure of pre-printed
  and hand-filled table-forms. The first module performs the cell identification based
  on Watershed transform. A second module detects the wrong cells produced by handwritten
  and/or pre-printed data. In this module, wrong cells and other cells are filtered
  by a compactness, perimeter and area analysis. In a third module, the wrong cells
  are merged with other cells to determine the exact structure. A miscellaneous database
  composed of 300 pre-printed and hand-filled table-form images was used to evaluate
  the efficiency of our methodology. Experiments showed significant and promising
  results.
