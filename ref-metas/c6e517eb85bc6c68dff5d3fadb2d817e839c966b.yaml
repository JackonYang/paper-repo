paperAbstract: The context in which a name appears in a caption provides powerful
  cues as to who is depicted in the associated image. We obtain 44,773 face images,
  using a face detector, from approximately half a million captioned news images and
  automatically link names, obtained using a named entity recognizer, with these faces.
  A simple clustering method can produce fair results. We improve these results significantly
  by combining the clustering process with a model of the probability that an individual
  is depicted given its context. Once the labeling procedure is over, we have an accurately
  labeled set of faces, an appearance model for each individual depicted, and a natural
  language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation.
