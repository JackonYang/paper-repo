paperAbstract: ACRONYM is a comprehensive domain independent model-based system for
  vision and manipulation related tasks. Many of its submodules and representations
  have been described elsewhere. Here the derivation and use of invariants for image
  feature prediction is described. Predictions of image features and their relations
  are made from three-dimensional geometric models. Instructions are generated which
  teli the interpretation algorithms how to make use of image feature measurements
  to derive three-dimensional size, structural, and spatial constraints on the original
  three-dimensional models. Some preliminary examples of ACRONYM's interpretations
  of aerial images are shown.
