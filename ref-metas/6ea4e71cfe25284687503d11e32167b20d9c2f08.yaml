paperAbstract: We have benchmarked the maximum obtainable recognition accuracy on
  five publicly available standard word image data sets using semi-automated segmentation
  and a commercial OCR. These images have been cropped from camera captured scene
  images, born digital images (BDI) and street view images. Using the Matlab based
  tool developed by us, we have annotated at the pixel level more than 3600 word images
  from the five data sets. The word images binarized by the tool, as well as by our
  own midline analysis and propagation of segmentation (MAPS) algorithm are recognized
  using the trial version of Nuance Omnipage OCR and these two results are compared
  with the best reported in the literature. The benchmark word recognition rates obtained
  on ICDAR 2003, Sign evaluation, Street view, Born-digital and ICDAR 2011 data sets
  are 83.9%, 89.3%, 79.6%, 88.5% and 86.7%, respectively. The results obtained from
  MAPS binarized word images without the use of any lexicon are 64.5% and 71.7% for
  ICDAR 2003 and 2011 respectively, and these values are higher than the best reported
  values in the literature of 61.1% and 41.2%, respectively. MAPS results of 82.8%
  for BDI 2011 dataset matches the performance of the state of the art method based
  on power law transform.
