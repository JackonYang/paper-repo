paperAbstract: "Recently, researchers have demonstrated that \"loopy belief propagation\"\
  \ -- the use of Pearl's polytree algorithm in a Bayesian network with loops -- can\
  \ perform well in the context of error-correcting codes. The most dramatic instance\
  \ of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose\
  \ decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured\
  \ Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about\
  \ the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate\
  \ inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed\
  \ using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures,\
  \ including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs\
  \ often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct\
  \ marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no\
  \ obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations\
  \ into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing\
  \ them lead to the wrong results."
