paperAbstract: Breiman's bagging and Freund and Schapire's boosting are recent methods
  for improving the predictive power of classifier learning systems. Both form a set
  of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap
  samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances.
  This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision
  trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches
  substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On
  the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small
  change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces
  this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets
  considered.
