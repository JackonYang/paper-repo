paperAbstract: We investigate the consequences of maximizing information transfer
  in a simple neural network (one input layer, one output layer), focusing on the
  case of nonlinear transfer functions. We assume that both receptive fields (synaptic
  efficacies) and transfer functions can be adapted to the environment. The main result
  is that, for bounded and invertible transfer functions, in the case of a vanishing
  additive output noise, and no input noise, maximization of information (Linsker's
  infomax principle) leads to a factorial code-hence to the same solution as required
  by the redundancy-reduction principle of Barlow. We also show that this result is
  valid for linear and, more generally, unbounded, transfer functions, provided optimization
  is performed under an additive constraint, i.e. which can be written as a sum of
  terms, each one being specific to one output neuron. Finally, we study the effect
  of a non-zero input noise. We find that, to first order in the input noise, assumed
  to be small in comparison with th...
