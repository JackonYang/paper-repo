paperAbstract: 'This article addresses two important themes in early visual computation:
  it presents a novel theory for learning the universal statistics of natural images,
  and, it proposes a general framework of designing reaction-diffusion equations for
  image processing. We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale
  invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed
  statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have
  potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup
  k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y))
  with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl
  lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential
  functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing
  prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted
  potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations
  given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion
  equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the
  inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing
  preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture
  pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful
  choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate
  features.'
