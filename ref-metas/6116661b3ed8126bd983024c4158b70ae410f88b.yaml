paperAbstract: After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms
  on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy
  minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides
  many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their
  practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope
  of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison
  of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We
  compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm
  that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan
  style "push-relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting
  paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts
  of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm
  works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time
  performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available
  upon request for research purposes.
