paperAbstract: This paper describes the application of Distributional Clustering [20]
  to document classification. This approach clusters words into groups based on the
  distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other
  unsupervised dimensionalityreduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing,
  we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining
  high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world
  data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensional&y by three orders of magnitude
  and lose only 2% accuracy-significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing [6],
  class-based clustering [l], feature selection by mutual information [23], or Markov-blanket-based
  feature selection [13]. We also show that less aggressive clustering sometimes results
  in improved classification accuracy over classification without clustering.
