paperAbstract: We present a framework for characterizing Bayesian classification methods.
  This framework can be thought of as a spectrum of allowable dependence in a given
  probabilistic model with the Naive Bayes algorithm at the most restrictive end and
  the learning of full Bayesian networks at the most general extreme. While much work
  has been carried out along the two ends of this spectrum, there has been surprising
  little done along the middle. We analyze the assumptions made as one moves along
  this spectrum and show the tradeoffs between model accuracy and learning speed which
  become critical to consider in a variety of data mining domains. We then present
  a general induction algorithm that allows for traversal of this spectrum depending
  on the available computational power for carrying out induction and show its application
  in a number of domains with different properties.
