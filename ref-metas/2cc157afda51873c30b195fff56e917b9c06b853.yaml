paperAbstract: "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well known for producing\
  \ state-of-the-art recognizers for document processing [1]. However, they can be\
  \ difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons\
  \ (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution,\
  \ b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing\
  \ units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer\
  \ (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product.\
  \ The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as\
  \ easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU.\
  \ We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character\
  \ recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic\
  \ 2.4X\u22123.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X\u2212\
  4.1X speedup."
