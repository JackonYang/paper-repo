paperAbstract: "no exception. MRP II and JIT=TQC in purchasing and supplier education\
  \ are covered in Chapter 15. Without proper education MRP II and JIT=TQC will not\
  \ be successful and will not generate their true bene\xAEts. Suppliers are key to\
  \ the success of MRP II and JIT=TQC. They therefore need to understand these disciplines.\
  \ Purchasing in the 21st century is going to be marked by continuous changes, by\
  \ who can gain the competitive edge \xAErst, who will be the most \u0304exible and\
  \ who will build the best supplier relationships. This will only be achieved by\
  \ following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization\
  \ must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark,\
  \ ignite change'! Only then can it happen! If you really want to know something\
  \ about purchasing then this is the book to read. It is most de\xAEnitely relevant\
  \ and more importantly up to date. It will certainly be a handy reference book for\
  \ a course on purchasing."
