paperAbstract: The problem of establishing correspondences between images taken from
  different viewpoints is fundamental in computer vision. We propose an algorithm
  which is capable of handling larger changes in viewpoint than classical correlation
  based techniques. Optimal performance for the algorithm is achieved for textured
  objects which are locally planar in at least one direction. The algorithm works
  by computing affinely invariant fourier features from intensity profiles in each
  image. The intensity profiles are extracted from the image data between randomly
  selected pairs of image interest points. Using a voting scheme, pairs of interest
  points are matched across images by comparing vectors of fourier features. Outliers
  among the matches are rejected in two stages, a fast stage using novel view consistency
  constraints, and a second, slower stage using RANSAC and fundamental matrix computation.
  In order to demonstrate the quality of the results, the algorithm is tested on several
  different image pairs.
