paperAbstract: Visual processing in cortex is classically modeled as a hierarchy of
  increasingly sophisticated representations, naturally extending the model of simple
  to complex cells of Hubel and Wiesel. Surprisingly, little quantitative modeling
  has been done to explore the biological feasibility of this class of models to explain
  aspects of higher-level visual processing such as object recognition. We describe
  a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal
  cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions.
  The model is based on a MAX-like operation applied to inputs to certain cortical
  neurons that may have a general role in cortical function.
