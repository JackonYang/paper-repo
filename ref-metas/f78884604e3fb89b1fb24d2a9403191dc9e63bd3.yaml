paperAbstract: "We investigate directed Markov fields over finite graphs without positivity\
  \ assumptions on the densities involved. A criterion for conditional independence\
  \ of two groups of variables given a third is given and named as the directed, global\
  \ Markov property. We give a simple proof of the fact that the directed, local Markov\
  \ property and directed, global Markov property are equivalent and \u2013 in the\
  \ case of absolute continuity w. r. t. a product measure \u2013 equivalent to the\
  \ recursive factorization of densities. It is argued that our criterion is easy\
  \ to use, it is sharper than that given by Kiiveri, Speed, and Carlin and equivalent\
  \ to that of Pearl. It follows that our criterion cannot be sharpened."
