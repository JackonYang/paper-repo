paperAbstract: "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information\
  \ which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation\
  \ of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis\
  \ of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye\
  \ reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within\
  \ the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019\
  s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge\
  \ pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for\
  \ a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the\
  \ primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently\
  \ because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus,\
  \ when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus\
  \ nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place\
  \ as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination\
  \ and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was\
  \ shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when\
  \ several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many\
  \ features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch\
  \ receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation\
  \ acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic\
  \ discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly\
  \ frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording\
  \ from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201Con\u201D discharges, similar to those\
  \ in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201Coff\u201D\
  \ discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201D\
  \ discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to\
  \ onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied\
  \ in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive\
  \ work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole,\
  \ they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge\
  \ types (see later)."
