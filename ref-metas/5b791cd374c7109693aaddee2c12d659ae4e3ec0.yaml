paperAbstract: This paper introduces Grid Long Short-Term Memory, a network of LSTM
  cells arranged in a multidimensional grid that can be applied to vectors, sequences
  or higher dimensional data such as images. The network differs from existing deep
  LSTM architectures in that the cells are connected between network layers as well
  as along the spatiotemporal dimensions of the data. The network provides a unified
  way of using LSTM for both deep and sequential computation. We apply the model to
  algorithmic tasks such as 15-digit integer addition and sequence memorization, where
  it is able to significantly outperform the standard LSTM. We then give results for
  two empirical tasks. We find that 2D Grid LSTM achieves 1.47 bits per character
  on the Wikipedia character prediction benchmark, which is state-of-the-art among
  neural approaches. In addition, we use the Grid LSTM to define a novel two-dimensional
  translation model, the Reencoder, and show that it outperforms a phrase-based reference
  system on a Chinese-to-English translation task.
