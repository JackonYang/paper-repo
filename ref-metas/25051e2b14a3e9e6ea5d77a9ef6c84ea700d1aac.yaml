paperAbstract: 'The goal of this paper is to recognize various deformable objects
  from images. To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models
  known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent
  articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher
  for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i)
  likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal;
  (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated
  that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show
  examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition
  performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative
  images.'
