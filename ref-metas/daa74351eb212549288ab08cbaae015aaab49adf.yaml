paperAbstract: We describe a set of pyramid transforms that decompose an image into
  a set of basis functions that are (a) spatial frequency tuned, (b) orientation tuned,
  (c) spatially localized, and (d) self-similar. For computational reasons the set
  is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are
  derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions
  based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically,
  leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the
  same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass
  kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact.
  We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image
  data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE
  and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap
  basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels.
