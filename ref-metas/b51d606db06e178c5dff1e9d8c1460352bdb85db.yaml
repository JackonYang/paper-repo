paperAbstract: 'We describe a learning-based method for recovering 3D human body pose
  from single images and monocular image sequences. Our approach requires neither
  an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it
  recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted
  automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation
  errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors.
  We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector
  machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both
  linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising
  performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance.
  The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose
  from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel
  regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together
  with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting
  system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a
  wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real
  human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations
  of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and
  qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained
  for a variety of walking motions.'
