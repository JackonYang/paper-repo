paperAbstract: Support Vector Learning Machines (SVM) are finding application in pattern
  recognition, regression estimation, and operator inversion for ill-posed problems.
  Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization
  performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing
  interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition
  problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the "virtual support
  vector" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This
  method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4%
  to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the "reduced set" method) does so by
  approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve
  a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine.
  The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original
  machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1 % error.
  The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances.
  The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine.
