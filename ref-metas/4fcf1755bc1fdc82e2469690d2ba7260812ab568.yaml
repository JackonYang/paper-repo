paperAbstract: Many sources of information relevant to computer vision and machine
  learning tasks are often underused. One example is the similarity between the elements
  from a novel source, such as a speaker, writer, or printed font. By comparing instances
  emitted by a source, we help ensure that similar instances are given the same label.
  Previous approaches have clustered instances prior to recognition. We propose a
  probabilistic framework that unifies similarity with prior identity and contextual
  information. By fusing information sources in a single model, we eliminate unrecoverable
  errors that result from processing the information in separate stages and improve
  overall accuracy. The framework also naturally integrates dissimilarity information,
  which has previously been ignored. We demonstrate with an application in printed
  character recognition from images of signs in natural scenes.
