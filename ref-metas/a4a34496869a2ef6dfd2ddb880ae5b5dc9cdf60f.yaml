paperAbstract: "Pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding are tasks\
  \ that usually must deal with complex but structured natural or artificial systems.\
  \ Patterns that we wish to classify are a consequence of a causal physical process.\
  \ Images that we wish to compress are also a consequence of a causal physical process.\
  \ Noisy outputs from a telephone line are corrupted versions of a signal produced\
  \ by a structured man-made telephone modem. Not only are these tasks characterized\
  \ by complex structure, but they also contain random elements. Graphical models\
  \ such as Bayesian networks provide a way to describe the relationships between\
  \ random variables in a stochastic system. \nIn this thesis, I use Bayesian networks\
  \ as an overarching framework to describe and solve problems in the areas of pattern\
  \ classification, data compression, and channel coding. Results on the classification\
  \ of handwritten digits show that Bayesian network pattern classifiers outperform\
  \ other standard methods, such as the k-nearest neighbor method. When Bayesian networks\
  \ are used as source models for data compression, an exponentially large number\
  \ of codewords are associated with each input pattern. It turns out that the code\
  \ can still be used efficiently, if a new technique called \"bits-back coding\"\
  \ is used. Several new error-correcting decoding algorithms are instances of \"\
  probability propagation\" in various Bayesian networks. These new schemes are rapidly\
  \ closing the gap between the performances of practical channel coding systems and\
  \ Shannon's 50-year-old channel coding limit. The Bayesian network framework exposes\
  \ the similarities between these codes and leads the way to a new class of \"trellis-constraint\
  \ codes\" which also operate close to Shannon's limit."
