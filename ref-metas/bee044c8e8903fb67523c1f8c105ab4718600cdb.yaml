paperAbstract: 'Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently
  misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but intentionally
  worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input
  results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early
  attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting.
  We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks'' vulnerability to adversarial
  perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative
  results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them:
  their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view
  yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach
  to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a
  maxout network on the MNIST dataset.'
