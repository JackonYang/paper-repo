paperAbstract: Dictionary learning has became an increasingly important task in machine
  learning, as it is fundamental to the representation problem. A number of emerging
  techniques specifically include a codebook learning step, in which a critical knowledge
  abstraction process is carried out. Existing approaches in dictionary (codebook)
  learning are either generative (unsupervised e.g. k-means) or discriminative (supervised
  e.g. extremely randomized forests). In this paper, we propose a multiple instance
  learning (MIL) strategy (along the line of weakly supervised learning) for dictionary
  learning. Each code is represented by a classifier, such as a linear SVM, which
  naturally performs metric fusion for multi-channel features. We design a formulation
  to simultaneously learn mixtures of codes by maximizing classification margins in
  MIL. State-of-the-art results are observed in image classification benchmarks based
  on the learned codebooks, which observe both compactness and effectiveness.
