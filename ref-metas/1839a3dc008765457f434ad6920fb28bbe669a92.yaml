paperAbstract: Table detection is always an important task of document analysis and
  recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective table detection method
  via visual separators and geometric content layout information, targeting at PDF
  documents. The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but
  also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore,
  we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout
  pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document
  dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method
  has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale
  Chinese e-Book production.
