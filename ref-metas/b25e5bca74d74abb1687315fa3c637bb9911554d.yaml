paperAbstract: "As Grice\u2019s enthusiasm for ordinary language philosophy became\
  \ increasingly qualified during the 1950s, his interest was growing in the rather\
  \ different styles of philosophy of language then current in America. Recent improvements\
  \ in communications had made possible an exchange of ideas across the Atlantic that\
  \ would have been unthinkable before the war. W. V. O. Quine had made a considerable\
  \ impression at Oxford during his time as Eastman Professor. Grice was interested\
  \ in Quine\u2019s logical approach to language, although he differed from him over\
  \ certain specific questions, such as the viability of the distinction between analytic\
  \ and synthetic statements. Quine, who was visiting England for a whole year, and\
  \ who brought with him clothes, books and even provisions in the knowledge that\
  \ rationing was still in force, travelled by ship.1 However, during the same decade\
  \ the rapid proliferation of passenger air travel enabled movement of academics\
  \ between Britain and America for even short stays and lecture tours. Grice himself\
  \ made a number of such visits, and was impressed by the formal and theory-driven\
  \ philosophy he encountered. Most of all he was impressed by the work of Noam Chomsky."
