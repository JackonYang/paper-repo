paperAbstract: "dents. The first six chapters, the sixth added since the first edition,\
  \ cover mixing processes, density and regression estimation for discrete time processes,\
  \ density and regression estimation for continuous time processes, and the local\
  \ time density estimator. The final chapter, also added since the first edition\
  \ and the only one not devoted to theoretical results, reviews some aspects of implementation\
  \ and gives examples. The book opens with a synopsis that defines the object of\
  \ the study as being the construction of time series alternatives to the usual BoxJenkins\
  \ SARIMA processes. Following that, it proceeds to highlight and summarize the main\
  \ ideas of the book, beginning with definitions of kernel density and regression\
  \ estimators and concluding with a brief list of some advantages of nonparametric\
  \ over parametric time series methods. Specific advantages listed are that they\
  \ are robust, that deseasonalization is not necessary, and that parametric convergence\
  \ rates can, under some circumstances, be achieved. Having provided that overview,\
  \ the book then proceeds in Chapter 1 to lay the theoretical groundwork for the\
  \ analysis of a wide class of time series by a review of historical results for\
  \ mixing processes. Results given include Berbee\u2019s and Bradley\u2019s lemmas\
  \ for coupling, some results for covariances and joint densities including Rio\u2019\
  s, Davydov\u2019s, and Billingsley\u2019s inequalities, some inequalities for partial\
  \ sums including Hoeffding\u2019s and Bernstein\u2019s, and some limit theorems\
  \ (laws of large numbers and central limit theorem) for strongly mixing processes.\
  \ Chapters 2 and 3 cover the analysis of discrete time processes, Chapter 2 focusing\
  \ on density estimation for sequences of correlated random variables and Chapter\
  \ 3 on regression estimation and prediction. Topics include some specific kernels,\
  \ optimal asymptotic quadratic error, uniform almost sure convergence for some kernels,\
  \ asymptotic normality, and prediction for some stationary and nonstationary processes.\
  \ These chapters are mainly review; although several results are from earlier papers\
  \ by the author, they are not, by and large, new. Chapters 4 and 5 consider estimation\
  \ for continuous time processes and are mainly new results. Their development is\
  \ a broad parallel of the \u2019 development of Chapters 2 and 3, with Chapter 4\
  \ devoted to density estimation and Chapter 5 covering regression estimation and\
  \ prediction. Topics and results include optimal and superoptimal asymptotic quadratic\
  \ error including a minimax bound of Kutoyants (1997) and minimaxity of intermediate\
  \ rates, optimal and superoptimal uniform convergence rates, asymptotic normality,\
  \ irregular and admissible sampling, and the convergence rates of continuous-time\
  \ nonparametric predictors. Some conditions are given under which a nonparametric\
  \ predictor reaches a parametric convergence rate. Chapter 6 explores the use of\
  \ local time for unbiased density estimation given a continuous time sample and\
  \ consists, apart from one result, of new results. A definition is given of local\
  \ time, followed by two existence criteria for local time, the first due to Geman\
  \ and Horowitz (1973, 1980) and the second proven by the author. A density estimator\
  \ based on local time is then defined and shown to be unbiased and consistent. Some\
  \ results on convergence rates are then given, followed by asymptotic normality,\
  \ a functional law of the iterated logarithm, and parametric rates for pointwise\
  \ and uniform convergence. Chapter 7 is a brief summary of some practical aspects\
  \ of nonparametric time series analysis. These fall into three areas-aspects of\
  \ implementation. the comparison of nonparametric with parametric methods, and applied\
  \ examples. The aspects of implementation addressed are variance stabilization via\
  \ BoxCox transformation, methods for eliminating trend and seasonality, methods\
  \ for choosing kernel bandwidth, and choosing a suitable order for predicting a\
  \ Markov process in which the true order of the process is unknown. In comparing\
  \ nonparametric and parametric methods of time series analysis, the book summarizes\
  \ the results of Carbon and Delecroix (1993). who considered several simulated autoregressive\
  \ moving average (ARMA) processes and some real business and engineering datasets,\
  \ and the results of Rosa (1993), who considered ARMA models with and without generalized\
  \ autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects. An appendix gives 17 tables\
  \ summarizing the results of the comparisons. Finally. some examples are given of\
  \ applying nonparametric methods to finance and economic data. The value of this\
  \ book is primarily in its theoretical development and, as such, it would be of\
  \ more interest to researchers in statistical theory and"
