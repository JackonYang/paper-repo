paperAbstract: "\n \n We describe a simple neural language model that relies only\
  \ on character-level inputs. Predictions are still made at the word-level. Our model\
  \ employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway net work over characters,\
  \ whose output is given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network\
  \ language model (RNN-LM). On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with\
  \ the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60% fewer parameters. On languages\
  \ with rich morphology (Arabic, Czech, French, German, Spanish, Russian), the model\
  \ outperforms word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with fewer parameters.\
  \ The results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for\
  \ language modeling. Analysis of word representations obtained from the character\
  \ composition part of the model reveals that the model is able to encode, from characters\
  \ only, both semantic and orthographic information.\n \n"
