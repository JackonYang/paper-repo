paperAbstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance
  on image classification tasks [14]. In this paper we go one step further and address
  the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also
  precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful
  formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks.
  We define a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution
  object detections at a low cost by a few network applications. State-of-the-art
  performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC.
