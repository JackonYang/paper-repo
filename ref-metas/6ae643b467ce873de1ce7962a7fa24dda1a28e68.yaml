paperAbstract: Bag-of-features representations have recently become popular for content
  based image classification owing to their simplicity and good performance. They
  evolved from texton methods in texture analysis. The basic idea is to treat images
  as loose collections of independent patches, sampling a representative set of patches
  from the image, evaluating a visual descriptor vector for each patch independently,
  and using the resulting distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization
  of the image. The four main implementation choices are thus how to sample patches,
  how to describe them, how to characterize the resulting distributions and how to
  classify images based on the result. We concentrate on the first issue, showing
  experimentally that for a representative selection of commonly used test databases
  and for moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal or better
  classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest operators that are in common
  use. Although interest operators work well for small numbers of samples, the single
  most important factor governing performance is the number of patches sampled from
  the test image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches
  to compete. We also study the influence of other factors including codebook size
  and creation method, histogram normalization method and minimum scale for feature
  extraction.
