paperAbstract: We describe novel aspects of a new natural language generator called
  Nitrogen. This generator has a highly flexible input representation that allows
  a spectrum of input from syntactic to semantic depth, and shifts the burden of many
  linguistic decisions to the statistical post-processor. The generation algorithm
  is compositional, making it efficient, yet it also handles non-compositional aspects
  of language. Nitrogen's design makes it robust and scalable, operating with lexicons
  and knowledge bases of one hundred thousand entities.
