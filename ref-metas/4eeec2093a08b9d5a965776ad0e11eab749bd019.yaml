paperAbstract: 'The growth of detection datasets and the multiple directions of object
  detection research provide both an unprecedented need and a great opportunity for
  a thorough evaluation of the current state of the field of categorical object detection.
  In this paper we strive to answer two key questions. First, where are we currently
  as a field: what have we done right, what still needs to be improved? Second, where
  should we be going in designing the next generation of object detectors? Inspired
  by the recent work of Hoiem et al. on the standard PASCAL VOC detection dataset,
  we perform a large-scale study on the Image Net Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
  (ILSVRC) data. First, we quantitatively demonstrate that this dataset provides many
  of the same detection challenges as the PASCAL VOC. Due to its scale of 1000 object
  categories, ILSVRC also provides an excellent test bed for understanding the performance
  of detectors as a function of several key properties of the object classes. We conduct
  a series of analyses looking at how different detection methods perform on a number
  of image-level and object-class-level properties such as texture, color, deformation,
  and clutter. We learn important lessons of the current object detection methods
  and propose a number of insights for designing the next generation object detectors.'
