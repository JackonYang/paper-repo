paperAbstract: While classical kernel-based classifiers are based on a single kernel,
  in practice it is often desirable to base classifiers on combinations of multiple
  kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices
  for the support vector machine (SVM), and showed that the optimization of the coefficients
  of such a combination reduces to a convex optimization problem known as a quadratically-constrained
  quadratic program (QCQP). Unfortunately, current convex optimization toolboxes can
  solve this problem only for a small number of kernels and a small number of data
  points; moreover, the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) techniques that are
  essential in large-scale implementations of the SVM cannot be applied because the
  cost function is non-differentiable. We propose a novel dual formulation of the
  QCQP as a second-order cone programming problem, and show how to exploit the technique
  of Moreau-Yosida regularization to yield a formulation to which SMO techniques can
  be applied. We present experimental results that show that our SMO-based algorithm
  is significantly more efficient than the general-purpose interior point methods
  available in current optimization toolboxes.
