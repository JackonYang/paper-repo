paperAbstract: The paper introduces some generalizations of Vapnik's (1982) method
  of structural risk minimization (SRM). As well as making explicit some of the details
  on SRM, it provides a result that allows one to trade off errors on the training
  sample against improved generalization performance. It then considers the more general
  case when the hierarchy of classes is chosen in response to the data. A result is
  presented on the generalization performance of classifiers with a "large margin".
  This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal
  margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their
  support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms
  of "luckiness" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous
  simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training
  sets. Four examples are given of such functions, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
  (1971) dimension measured on the sample.
