paperAbstract: This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level
  convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several
  large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve
  state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional
  models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning
  models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.
