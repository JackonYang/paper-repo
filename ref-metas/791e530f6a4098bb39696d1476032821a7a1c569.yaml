paperAbstract: Two of the most critical requirements in support of producing reliable
  face-recognition systems are a large database of facial images and a testing procedure
  to evaluate systems. The Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program has addressed
  both issues through the FERET database of facial images and the establishment of
  the FERET tests. To date, 14,126 images from 1199 individuals are included in the
  FERET database, which is divided into development and sequestered portions. In September
  1996, the FERET program administered the third in a series of FERET face-recognition
  tests. The primary objectives of the third test were to (1) assess the state of
  the art, (2) identify future areas of research, and (3) measure algorithm performance
  on large databases.
