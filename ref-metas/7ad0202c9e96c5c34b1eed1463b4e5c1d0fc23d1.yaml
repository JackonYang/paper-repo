paperAbstract: Archival documents are difficult to recognize because they are often
  damaged. Moreover, variations between documents are important even for documents
  having a priori the same structure. A recognition system to overcome these difficulties
  requires external knowledge. Therefore we present a recognition system using a user
  description. To use table descriptions in analyzing the image, our system uses the
  intersections of two rulings with a close extremity of one or each of these two
  rulings. We present some results to show how our system can recognize tables with
  a general description and how it can deal with noise with a more precise description.
