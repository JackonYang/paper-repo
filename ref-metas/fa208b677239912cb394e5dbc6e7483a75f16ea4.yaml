paperAbstract: 'Many approaches have reported that knowledge-based layout recognition
  methods are very successful in classifying the meaningful data from document images
  automatically. However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of
  documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition
  information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents
  intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout
  structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors
  introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes
  of layout structures. The authors'' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge
  acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition
  mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification
  tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures
  of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure
  recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted
  and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting
  the structure description tree. >'
