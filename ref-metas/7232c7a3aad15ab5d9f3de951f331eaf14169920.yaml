paperAbstract: This paper discusses how local measurements of three- dimensional positions
  and surface normals (recorded by a set of tactile sensors, or by three-dimensional
  range sensors), may be used to identify and locate objects from among a set of known
  objects. The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom
  relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between
  sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints
  on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to
  the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and
  by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints
  is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object
  from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation
  range sensor is illustrated.
