paperAbstract: Understanding a visual scene goes beyond recognizing individual objects
  in isolation. Relationships between objects also constitute rich semantic information
  about the scene. In this work, we explicitly model the objects and their relationships
  using scene graphs, a visually-grounded graphical structure of an image. We propose
  a novel end-to-end model that generates such structured scene representation from
  an input image. Our key insight is that the graph generation problem can be formulated
  as message passing between the primal node graph and its dual edge graph. Our joint
  inference model can take advantage of contextual cues to make better predictions
  on objects and their relationships. The experiments show that our model significantly
  outperforms previous methods on the Visual Genome dataset as well as support relation
  inference in NYU Depth V2 dataset.
