paperAbstract: 'Recently two anomalous results in the literature have shown that certain
  feature learning architectures can yield useful features for object recognition
  tasks even with untrained, random weights. In this paper we pose the question: why
  do random weights sometimes do so well? Our answer is that certain convolutional
  pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and translation invariant,
  even with random weights. Based on this we demonstrate the viability of extremely
  fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures,
  thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. We then show that a surprising
  fraction of the performance of certain state-of-the-art methods can be attributed
  to the architecture alone.'
