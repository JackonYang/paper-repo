paperAbstract: 'Text detection in natural scene images is an important prerequisite
  for many content-based image analysis tasks, while most current research efforts
  only focus on horizontal or near horizontal scene text. In this paper, first we
  present a unified distance metric learning framework for adaptive hierarchical clustering,
  which can simultaneously learn similarity weights (to adaptively combine different
  feature similarities) and the clustering threshold (to automatically determine the
  number of clusters). Then, we propose an effective multi-orientation scene text
  detection system, which constructs text candidates by grouping characters based
  on this adaptive clustering. Our text candidates construction method consists of
  several sequential coarse-to-fine grouping steps: morphology-based grouping via
  single-link clustering, orientation-based grouping via divisive hierarchical clustering,
  and projection-based grouping also via divisive clustering. The effectiveness of
  our proposed system is evaluated on several public scene text databases, e.g., ICDAR
  Robust Reading Competition data sets (2011 and 2013), MSRA-TD500 and NEOCR. Specifically,
  on the multi-orientation text data set MSRA-TD500, the <inline-formula><tex-math>$f$</tex-math><alternatives>

  percent, much better than the state-of-the-art performance. We also construct and
  release a practical challenging multi-orientation scene text data set (USTB-SV1K),
  which is available at http://prir.ustb.edu.cn/TexStar/MOMV-text-detection/.'
