paperAbstract: "Recent research in texture discrimination has revealed the existence\
  \ of a separate \u201Cpreattentive visual system\u201D that cannot process complex\
  \ forms, yet can, almost instantaneously, without effort or scrutiny, detect differences\
  \ in a few local conspicuous features, regardless of where they occur. These features,\
  \ called \u201Ctextons\u201D, are elongated blobs (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, or\
  \ line segments) with specific properties, including color, angular orientation,\
  \ width, length, binocular and movement disparity, and flicker rate. The ends-of-lines\
  \ (terminators) and crossings of line segments are also textons. Only differences\
  \ in the textons or in their density (or number) can be preattentively detected\
  \ while the positional relationship between neighboring textons passes unnoticed.\
  \ This kind of positional information is the essence of form perception, and can\
  \ be extracted only by a time-consuming and spatially restricted process that we\
  \ call \u201Cfocal attention\u201D. The aperture of focal attention can be very\
  \ narrow, even restricted to a minute portion of the fovea, and shifting its locus\
  \ requires about 50 ms. Thus preattentive vision serves as an \u201Cearly warning\
  \ system\u201D by pointing out those loci of texton differences that should be attended\
  \ to. According to this theory, at any given instant the visual information intake\
  \ is relatively modest."
