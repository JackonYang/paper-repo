paperAbstract: Intelligent document understanding (IDU) systems convert scanned document
  pages into an electronic format which preserves layout and logical document structure
  in addition to document content. MOst of the IDU experimental systems, however,
  lack the capability of full exploitation of recognition results. In this paper we
  present an integrated IDU system that processes documents all the way from recognition
  to full utilization using standard generalized markup language (SGML). The standardization
  and widespread use of SGML-based tools provides the means for filling the gap between
  document recognition and seamless document reuse. The conversion process involves
  OCR of a multipage document, document structure analysis, processing of tabular
  data and mathematical expressions, and generation of the final SGML description.
  Document structure analysis is reduce here to parsing OCR results and recreating
  document structure by performing fuzzy searches for standard phrases and format
  analysis. Tabular data processing utilizes OCR results with positional data, horizontal
  lines and heuristic rules to determine cell boundaries and contents. Recognition
  of mathematical expressions involves OCR on an extended symbol set, and equation
  structure recognition via transformations on a tree representation. The transformations
  are ordered and involve connecting of separated symbols, context-sensitive OCR correction,
  extraction of horizontally aligned subexpressions, subscript and superscript processing,
  and a general processing of symbols detected above or below the target symbol.
