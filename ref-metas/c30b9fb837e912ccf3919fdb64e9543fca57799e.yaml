paperAbstract: While knowledge transfer (KT) between object classes has been accepted
  as a promising route towards scalable recognition, most experimental KT studies
  are surprisingly limited in the number of object classes considered. To support
  claims of KT w.r.t. scalability we thus advocate to evaluate KT in a large-scale
  setting. To this end, we provide an extensive evaluation of three popular approaches
  to KT on a recently proposed large-scale data set, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual
  Recognition Competition 2010 data set. In a first setting they are directly compared
  to one-vs-all classification often neglected in KT papers and in a second setting
  we evaluate their ability to enable zero-shot learning. While none of the KT methods
  can improve over one-vs-all classification they prove valuable for zero-shot learning,
  especially hierarchical and direct similarity based KT. We also propose and describe
  several extensions of the evaluated approaches that are necessary for this large-scale
  study.
