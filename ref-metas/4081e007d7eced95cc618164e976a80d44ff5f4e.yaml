paperAbstract: Image understanding requires not only individually estimating elements
  of the visual world but also capturing the interplay among them. In this paper,
  we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the
  overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations,
  and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations
  in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D
  geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into
  perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach
  reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses
  to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of
  almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image
  understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach.
