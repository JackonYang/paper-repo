paperAbstract: "Recent work has shown that visual attributes are a powerful approach\
  \ for applications such as recognition, image description and retrieval. However,\
  \ fusing multiple attribute scores - as required during multi-attribute queries\
  \ or similarity searches - presents a significant challenge. Scores from different\
  \ attribute classifiers cannot be combined in a simple way; the same score for different\
  \ attributes can mean different things. In this work, we show how to construct normalized\
  \ \u201Cmulti-attribute spaces\u201D from raw classifier outputs, using techniques\
  \ based on the statistical Extreme Value Theory. Our method calibrates each raw\
  \ score to a probability that the given attribute is present in the image. We describe\
  \ how these probabilities can be fused in a simple way to perform more accurate\
  \ multiattribute searches, as well as enable attribute-based similarity searches.\
  \ A significant advantage of our approach is that the normalization is done after-the-fact,\
  \ requiring neither modification to the attribute classification system nor ground\
  \ truth attribute annotations. We demonstrate results on a large data set of nearly\
  \ 2 million face images and show significant improvements over prior work. We also\
  \ show that perceptual similarity of search results increases by using contextual\
  \ attributes."
