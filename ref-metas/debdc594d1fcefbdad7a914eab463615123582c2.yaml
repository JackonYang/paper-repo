paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a system that recognizes objects in a jumble,
  verifies them, and then determines some essential configurational information, such
  as which ones are on top. The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the
  objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive
  edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then "grows"
  a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to
  be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.)
  Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis
  to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured
  range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects
  in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration-
  understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing
  the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental
  results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin.
