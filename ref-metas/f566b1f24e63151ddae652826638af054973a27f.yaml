paperAbstract: Convolutional networks have achieved a great deal of success in high-level
  vision problems such as object recognition. Here we show that they can also be used
  as a general method for low-level image processing. As an example of our approach,
  convolutional networks are trained using gradient learning to solve the problem
  of restoring noisy or degraded images. For our training data, we have used electron
  microscopic images of neural circuitry with ground truth restorations provided by
  human experts. On this dataset, Markov random field (MRF), conditional random field
  (CRF), and anisotropic diffusion algorithms perform about the same as simple thresholding,
  but superior performance is obtained with a convolutional network containing over
  34,000 adjustable parameters. When restored by this convolutional network, the images
  are clean enough to be used for segmentation, whereas the other approaches fail
  in this respect. We do not believe that convolutional networks are fundamentally
  superior to MRFs as a representation for image processing algorithms. On the contrary,
  the two approaches are closely related. But in practice, it is possible to train
  complex convolutional networks, while even simple MRF models are hindered by problems
  with Bayesian learning and inference procedures. Our results suggest that high model
  complexity is the single most important factor for good performance, and this is
  possible with convolutional networks.
