paperAbstract: "We argue that the machine translation community is overly reliant\
  \ on the Bleu machine translation evaluation metric. We show that an improved Bleu\
  \ score is neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving an actual improvement\
  \ in translation quality, and give two significant counterexamples to Bleu\u2019\
  s correlation with human judgments of quality. This offers new potential for research\
  \ which was previously deemed unpromising by an inability to improve upon Bleu scores."
