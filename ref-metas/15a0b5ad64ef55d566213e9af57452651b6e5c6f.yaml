paperAbstract: Surveys the developments of the last 20 years in the area of vision
  for mobile robot navigation. Two major components of the paper deal with indoor
  navigation and outdoor navigation. For each component, we have further subdivided
  our treatment of the subject on the basis of structured and unstructured environments.
  For indoor robots in structured environments, we have dealt separately with the
  cases of geometrical and topological models of space. For unstructured environments,
  we have discussed the cases of navigation using optical flows, using methods from
  the appearance-based paradigm, and by recognition of specific objects in the environment.
