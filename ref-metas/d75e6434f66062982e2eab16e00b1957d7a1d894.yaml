paperAbstract: 'Microfilm documents contain a wealth of information, but extracting
  and organizing this information by hand is slow, error-prone, and tedious. As an
  initial step toward automating access to this information, we describe in this paper
  an algorithmic process to automatically identify record patterns found in microfilm
  tables for pre-specified application domains. Our table-processing algorithm accepts
  an XML input file describing the individual cells of a table taken from a microfilm
  document, and finds for each record in the document the cells that together comprise
  the record. Two key features drive the algorithm: (1) geometric layout and (2) label
  matching with respect to a given domain-specific application ontology. The algorithm
  achieved an accuracy of 92% on our test corpus of genealogical microfilm tables.'
