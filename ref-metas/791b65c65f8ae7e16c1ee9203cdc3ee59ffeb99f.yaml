paperAbstract: The state-of-the-art methods used for relation classification are primarily
  based on statistical machine learning, and their performance strongly depends on
  the quality of the extracted features. The extracted features are often derived
  from the output of pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) systems, which
  leads to the propagation of the errors in the existing tools and hinders the performance
  of these systems. In this paper, we exploit a convolutional deep neural network
  (DNN) to extract lexical and sentence level features. Our method takes all of the
  word tokens as input without complicated pre-processing. First, the word tokens
  are transformed to vectors by looking up word embeddings 1 . Then, lexical level
  features are extracted according to the given nouns. Meanwhile, sentence level features
  are learned using a convolutional approach. These two level features are concatenated
  to form the final extracted feature vector. Finally, the features are fed into a
  softmax classifier to predict the relationship between two marked nouns. The experimental
  results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods.
