paperAbstract: We present a method for estimating articulated human pose from a single
  static image based on a graphical model with novel pairwise relations that make
  adaptive use of local image measurements. More precisely, we specify a graphical
  model for human pose which exploits the fact the local image measurements can be
  used both to detect parts (or joints) and also to predict the spatial relationships
  between them (Image Dependent Pairwise Relations). These spatial relationships are
  represented by a mixture model. We use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs)
  to learn conditional probabilities for the presence of parts and their spatial relationships
  within image patches. Hence our model combines the representational flexibility
  of graphical models with the efficiency and statistical power of DCNNs. Our method
  significantly outperforms the state of the art methods on the LSP and FLIC datasets
  and also performs very well on the Buffy dataset without any training.
