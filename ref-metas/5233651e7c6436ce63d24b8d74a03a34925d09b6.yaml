paperAbstract: We have proposed a complete system for text detection and localization
  in gray scale scene images. A boosting framework integrating feature and weak classifier
  selection based on computational complexity is proposed to construct efficient text
  detectors. The proposed scheme uses a small set of heterogeneous features which
  are spatially combined to build a large set of features. A neural network based
  localizer learns necessary rules for localization. The evaluation is done on the
  challenging ICDAR 2003 robust reading and text locating database. The results are
  encouraging and our system can localize text of various font sizes and styles in
  complex background.
