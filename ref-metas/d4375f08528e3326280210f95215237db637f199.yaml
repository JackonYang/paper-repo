paperAbstract: Describes a hidden Markov model-based approach designed to recognize
  off-line unconstrained handwritten words for large vocabularies. After preprocessing,
  a word image is segmented into letters or pseudoletters and represented by two feature
  sequences of equal length, each consisting of an alternating sequence of shape-symbols
  and segmentation-symbols, which are both explicitly modeled. The word model is made
  up of the concatenation of appropriate letter models consisting of elementary HMMs
  and an HMM-based interpolation technique is used to optimally combine the two feature
  sets. Two rejection mechanisms are considered depending on whether or not the word
  image is guaranteed to belong to the lexicon. Experiments carried out on real-life
  data show that the proposed approach can be successfully used for handwritten word
  recognition.
