paperAbstract: "We introduce a number of techniques designed to help integrate semantic\
  \ knowledge with N-gram language models for automatic speech recognition. Our techniques\
  \ allow us to integrate Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a word-similarity algorithm\
  \ based on word co-occurrence information, with N-gram models. While LSA is good\
  \ at predicting content words which are coherent with the rest of a text, it is\
  \ a bad predictor of frequent words, has a low dynamic range, and is inaccurate\
  \ when combined linearly with N-grams. We show that modifying the dynamic range,\
  \ applying a per-word con \uFB01 dence metric, and using geometric rather than linear\
  \ combinations with N-grams produces a more robust language model which has a lower\
  \ perplexity on a Wall Street Journal test-set than a baseline N-gram model."
