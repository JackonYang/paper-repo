paperAbstract: 'In this work we introduce a novel approach to object categorization
  that incorporates two types of context-co-occurrence and relative location - with
  local appearance-based features. Our approach, named CoLA (for co-occurrence, location
  and appearance), uses a conditional random field (CRF) to maximize object label
  agreement according to both semantic and spatial relevance. We model relative location
  between objects using simple pairwise features. By vector quantizing this feature
  space, we learn a small set of prototypical spatial relationships directly from
  the data. We evaluate our results on two challenging datasets: PASCAL 2007 and MSRC.
  The results show that combining co-occurrence and spatial context improves accuracy
  in as many as half of the categories compared to using co-occurrence alone.'
