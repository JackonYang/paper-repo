paperAbstract: 'Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely
  useful in a variety of prediction tasks, from content recommendation to identifying
  protein functions. However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the
  graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are
  inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we
  present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information
  (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen
  data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function
  that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node''s local
  neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification
  benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs
  based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes
  to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.'
