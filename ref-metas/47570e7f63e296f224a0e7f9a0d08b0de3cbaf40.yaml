paperAbstract: Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural
  language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering
  for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex,
  and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced
  sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely
  used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus
  that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard
  parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this
  model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without
  the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences
  per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.
