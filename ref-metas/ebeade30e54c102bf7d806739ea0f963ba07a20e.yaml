paperAbstract: This paper presents work done in locating and extracting tables and
  their contents from document images. While most research in the area of table analysis
  and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon
  the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout
  of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry,
  syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known
  image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents,
  and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer
  blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also
  be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as
  connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2].
