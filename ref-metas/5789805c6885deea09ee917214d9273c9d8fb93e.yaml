paperAbstract: Graphs have been an essential tool for the analysis and communication
  of statistical data for about 200 years. Despite widespread use and their importance
  in science, business, and many other walks of life, relatively little is known about
  how people perceive and process statistical graphs. This article reviews several
  empirical studies designed to explore the suitability of various graphs for a variety
  of purposes, and discusses the relevant theoretical psychological literature. The
  role of traditional psychophysics is considered, especially in connection with the
  long-running dispute concerning the relative merits of pie and bar charts. The review
  also discusses experiments on the perception of scatterplots and the use of multivariate
  displays, and points out the need for more empirical work.
