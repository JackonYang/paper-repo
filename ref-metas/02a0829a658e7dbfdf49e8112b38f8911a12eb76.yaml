paperAbstract: 'Abstract : This dissertation describes techniques for efficiently
  matching corresponding areas of a stereo pair of images. Measures of match which
  are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search
  for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable
  camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair
  of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to
  detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting
  when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching
  areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an
  image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these
  techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images.'
