paperAbstract: We propose a set of baseline heuristics for identifying genuinely tabular
  information and news links in HTML documents. A prototype implementation of these
  heuristics is described for delivering content from news providers' home pages to
  a narrow-bandwidth device such as a portable digital assistant or cellular phone
  display. Its evaluation on 75 Web sites is provided, along with a discussion of
  topics for future research.
