paperAbstract: The authors describe a communication theory approach to document image
  reconstruction, patterned after the use of hidden Markov models in speech recognition.
  A document recognition problem is viewed as consisting of three elements-an image
  generator, a noisy channel, and an image decoder. A document image generator is
  a Markov source which combines a message source with an imager. The message source
  produces a string of symbols which contains the information to be transmitted. The
  imager is modeled as a finite-state transducer, which converts the message into
  an ideal bitmap. The channel transforms the ideal image into a noisy observed image.
  The decoder estimates the message from the observed image by finding the a posteriori
  most probable path through the combined source and channel models using a Viterbi-like
  algorithm. Application of the proposed method to decoding telephone yellow pages
  is described.<<ETX>>
