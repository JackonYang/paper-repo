paperAbstract: The computation of optical flow relies on merging information available
  over an image patch to form an estimate of 2-D image velocity at a point. This merging
  process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component
  velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which
  arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with
  these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model
  to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the
  EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion
  parameters. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach is computationally
  efficient, and that it can provide robust estimates of the optical flow values in
  the presence of outliers and multiple motions.<<ETX>>
