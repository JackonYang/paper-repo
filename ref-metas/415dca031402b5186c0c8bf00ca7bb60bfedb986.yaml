paperAbstract: 'A higher order recurrent neural network architecture learns to recognize
  and generate languages after being "trained" on categorized exemplars. Studying
  these networks from the perspective of dynamical systems yields two interesting
  discoveries: First, a longitudinal examination of the learning process illustrates
  a new form of mechanical inference: Induction by phase transition. A small weight
  adjustment causes a "bifurcation" in the limit behavior of the network. This phase
  transition corresponds to the onset of the network''s capacity for generalizing
  to arbitrary-length strings. Second, a study of the automata resulting from the
  acquisition of previously published languages indicates that while the architecture
  is NOT guaranteed to find a minimal finite automata consistent with the given exemplars,
  which is an NP-Hard problem, the architecture does appear capable of generating
  nonregular languages by exploiting fractal and chaotic dynamics. I end the paper
  with a hypothesis relating linguistic generative capacity to the behavioral regimes
  of non-linear dynamical systems.'
