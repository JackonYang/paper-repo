paperAbstract: This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance
  between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus
  statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic
  space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational
  evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the
  proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of
  the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the
  information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity
  ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives
  the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity
  judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate
  the same task.
