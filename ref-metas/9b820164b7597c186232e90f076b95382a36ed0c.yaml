paperAbstract: We present a multiscale spectral image segmentation algorithm. In contrast
  to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of
  the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level
  details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images.
  We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We
  construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for
  image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into
  multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We
  show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales
  can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation
  algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint
  to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale.
  As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity,
  providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not
  be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this
  method.
