paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to extract meaningful content
  information from video by collaborative integration of image understanding and natural
  language processing. As an actual example, we developed a system that associates
  faces and names in videos, called Name-It, which is given news videos as a knowledge
  source, then automatically extracts face and name association as content information.
  The system can infer the name of a given unknown face image, or guess faces which
  are likely to have the name given to the system. This paper explains the method
  with several successful matching results which reveal effectiveness in integrating
  heterogeneous techniques as well as the importance of real content information extraction
  from video, especially face-name association.
