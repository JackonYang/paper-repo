paperAbstract: To learn a new visual category from few examples, prior knowledge from
  unlabeled data as well as previous related categories may be useful. We develop
  a new method for transfer learning which exploits available unlabeled data and an
  arbitrary kernel function; we form a representation based on kernel distances to
  a large set of unlabeled data points. To transfer knowledge from previous related
  problems we observe that a category might be learnable using only a small subset
  of reference prototypes. Related problems may share a significant number of relevant
  prototypes; we find such a concise representation by performing a joint loss minimization
  over the training sets of related problems with a shared regularization penalty
  that minimizes the total number of prototypes involved in the approximation. This
  optimization problem can be formulated as a linear program that can be solved efficiently.
  We conduct experiments on a news-topic prediction task where the goal is to predict
  whether an image belongs to a particular news topic. Our results show that when
  only few examples are available for training a target topic, leveraging knowledge
  learnt from other topics can significantly improve performance.
