paperAbstract: 'We present a system developed for content-based broadcast news video
  browsing for home users. There are three main factors that distinguish our work
  from other similar ones. First, we have integrated the image and audio analysis
  results in identifying news segments. Second, we use the video OCR technology to
  detect text from frames, which provides a good source of textual information for
  story classification when transcripts and close captions are not available. Finally,
  natural language processing (NLP) technologies are used to perform automated categorization
  of news stories based on the texts obtained from close caption or video OCR process.
  Based on these video structure and content analysis technologies, we have developed
  two advanced video browsers for home users: intelligent highlight player and HTML-based
  video browser.'
