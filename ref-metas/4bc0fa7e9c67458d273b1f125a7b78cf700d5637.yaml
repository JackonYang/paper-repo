paperAbstract: We present efficient techniques for the interpretation and representation
  of tabular documents. Our goal is to achieve processing times that are fast enough
  for an interactive table conversion system. The techniques are based on the run-length
  encoded representation of scanned documents. We use DSX assignment tables, a predominant
  type of engineering drawing in telephone company central offices, as sample images
  in this paper. However, the techniques presented can be applied directly to tabular
  documents in any application.
