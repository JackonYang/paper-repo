paperAbstract: The complexity of the visual world creates significant challenges for
  comprehensive visual understanding. In spite of recent successes in visual recognition,
  today's vision systems would still struggle to deal with visual queries that require
  a deeper reasoning. We propose a knowledge base (KB) framework to handle an assortment
  of visual queries, without the need to train new classifiers for new tasks. Building
  such a large-scale multimodal KB presents a major challenge of scalability. We cast
  a large-scale MRF into a KB representation, incorporating visual, textual and structured
  data, as well as their diverse relations. We introduce a scalable knowledge base
  construction system that is capable of building a KB with half billion variables
  and millions of parameters in a few hours. Our system achieves competitive results
  compared to purpose-built models on standard recognition and retrieval tasks, while
  exhibiting greater flexibility in answering richer visual queries.
