paperAbstract: Three converving procedures were used to determine whether pictures
  presented in a rapid sequence at rates comparable to eye fixations are understood
  and then quickly forgotten. In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs
  were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects
  were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other
  groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified
  by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition
  memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named
  targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec
  preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate
  as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter
  and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average
  a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about
  100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation
  is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions
  of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed.
