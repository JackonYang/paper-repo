paperAbstract: We address the problem of articulated human pose estimation by learning
  a coarse-to-fine cascade of pictorial structure models. While the fine-level state-space
  of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models,
  most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser
  scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions,
  where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals.
  The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses
  for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive
  segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered
  set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL
  human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art.
