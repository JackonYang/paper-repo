paperAbstract: Shape indexing is a way of making rapid associations between features
  detected in an image and object models that could have produced them. When model
  databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the
  improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest
  neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of
  the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis
  recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new
  variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces
  practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which
  finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close
  neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully
  developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered
  scenes in just a few seconds.
