paperAbstract: 'Today, visual recognition systems are still rarely employed in robotics
  applications. Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding
  benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous
  driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo,
  optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform
  is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and
  a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical
  flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than
  200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30
  pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal
  that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below
  average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to
  reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to
  the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti.'
