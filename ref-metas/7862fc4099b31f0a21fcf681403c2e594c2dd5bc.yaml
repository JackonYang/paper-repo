paperAbstract: We consider a texture to be a stochastic, possibly periodic, two-dimensional
  image field. A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and
  describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture
  models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution
  with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the
  number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method
  of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical
  and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters
  of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering
  in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like,
  and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and
  their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis
  test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random
  field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters
  of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic
  microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous
  textures did not.
