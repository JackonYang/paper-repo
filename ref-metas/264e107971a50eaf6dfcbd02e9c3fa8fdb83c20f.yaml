paperAbstract: For many pattern recognition applications including speech recognition
  and optical character recognition, prior models of language are used to disambiguate
  otherwise equally probable outputs. It is common practice to use tables of probabilities
  of single words, pairs of words, and triples of words (n-grams) as a prior model.
  Our research is directed to 'backing-off' methods, that is, methods that build an
  (n+l)gram model from an n-gram model.
