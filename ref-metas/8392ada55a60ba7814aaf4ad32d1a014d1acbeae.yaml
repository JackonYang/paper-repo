paperAbstract: We present a model of curvilinear grouping using piece-wise linear
  representations of contours and a conditional random field to capture continuity
  and the frequency of different junction types. Potential completions are generated
  by building a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) over the set of contours
  found by a local edge detector. Maximum likelihood parameters for the model are
  learned from human labeled ground truth. Using held out test data, we measure how
  the model, by incorporating continuity structure, improves boundary detection over
  the local edge detector. We also compare performance with a baseline local classifier
  that operates on pairs of edgels. Both algorithms consistently dominate the low-level
  boundary detector at all thresholds. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
  curvilinear continuity has been shown quantitatively useful for a large variety
  of natural images. Better boundary detection has immediate application in the problem
  of object detection and recognition
