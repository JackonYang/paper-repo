paperAbstract: "We investigate a method for learning object categories in a weakly\
  \ supervised manner. Given a set of images known to contain the target category\
  \ from a similar viewpoint, learning is translation and scale-invariant; does not\
  \ require alignment or correspondence between the training images, and is robust\
  \ to clutter and occlusion. Category models are probabilistic constellations of\
  \ parts, and their parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the\
  \ training data. The appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position,\
  \ relative scale and probability of detection are explicitly described in the model.\
  \ Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder identifies promising\
  \ locations for the model\u201Ds parts. Second, the category model is used to compare\
  \ the likelihood that the observed features are generated by the category model,\
  \ or are generated by background clutter. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated\
  \ by results over six diverse object categories including geometrically constrained\
  \ categories (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."
