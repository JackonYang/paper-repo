paperAbstract: In this paper, we carry out two experiments on the TIMIT speech corpus
  with bidirectional and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In
  the first experiment (framewise phoneme classification) we find that bidirectional
  LSTMoutperforms both unidirectional LSTMand conventional Recurrent Neural Networks
  (RNNs). In the second (phoneme recognition) we find that a hybrid BLSTM-HMM system
  improves on an equivalent traditional HMM system, as well as unidirectional LSTM-HMM.
