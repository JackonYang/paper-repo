paperAbstract: 'In object detection, reducing computational cost is as important as
  improving accuracy for most practical usages. This paper proposes a novel network
  structure, which is an order of magnitude lighter than other state-of-the-art networks
  while maintaining the accuracy. Based on the basic principle of more layers with
  less channels, this new deep neural network minimizes its redundancy by adopting
  recent innovations including C.ReLU and Inception structure. We also show that this
  network can be trained efficiently to achieve solid results on well-known object
  detection benchmarks: 84.9% and 84.2% mAP on VOC2007 and VOC2012 while the required
  compute is less than 10% of the recent ResNet-101.'
