paperAbstract: Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) have achieved great success
  in scene text detection. However, this low-level pixel operation inherently limits
  its capability for handling complex text information efficiently (e. g. connections
  between text or background components), leading to the difficulty in distinguishing
  texts from background components. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to
  tackle this problem by leveraging the high capability of convolutional neural network
  (CNN). In contrast to recent methods using a set of low-level heuristic features,
  the CNN network is capable of learning high-level features to robustly identify
  text components from text-like outliers (e.g. bikes, windows, or leaves). Our approach
  takes advantages of both MSERs and sliding-window based methods. The MSERs operator
  dramatically reduces the number of windows scanned and enhances detection of the
  low-quality texts. While the sliding-window with CNN is applied to correctly separate
  the connections of multiple characters in components. The proposed system achieved
  strong robustness against a number of extreme text variations and serious real-world
  problems. It was evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 benchmark dataset, and achieved over
  78% in F-measure, which is significantly higher than previous methods.
