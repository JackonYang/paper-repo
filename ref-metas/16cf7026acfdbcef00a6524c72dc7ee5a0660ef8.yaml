paperAbstract: "A novel approach to appearance based object recognition is introduced.\
  \ The proposed method, based on matching of local image features, reliably recognises\
  \ objects under very different viewing conditions. First, distinguished regions\
  \ of data-dependent shape are robustly detected. On these regions, local affine\
  \ frames are established using several affine invariant constructions. Direct comparison\
  \ of photometrically normalised colour intensities in local, geometrically aligned\
  \ frames results in a matching scheme that is invariant to piecewise-affine image\
  \ deformations, but still remains very discriminative. The potential of the approach\
  \ is experimentally verified on COIL-100 and SOIL-47 \u2010 publicly available image\
  \ databases. On SOIL-47, 100% recognition rate is achieved for single training view\
  \ per object. On COIL-100, 99.9% recognition rate is obtained for 18 training views\
  \ per object. Robustness to severe occlusions is demonstrated by only a moderate\
  \ decrease of recognition performance in an experiment where half of each test image\
  \ is erased."
