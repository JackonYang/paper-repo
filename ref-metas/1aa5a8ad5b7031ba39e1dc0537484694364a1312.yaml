paperAbstract: Image category recognition is important to access visual information
  on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have
  been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination
  invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because
  many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant
  descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper
  studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software
  to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com)
  in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are
  explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric
  transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination
  conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally
  using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From
  the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light
  intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results
  further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is
  category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge
  about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT
  is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based
  SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by
  7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.
