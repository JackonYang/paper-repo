paperAbstract: We present a system for the interpretation of camera images of scenes
  composed of several known objects with mutual occlusion. The scenes are analyzed
  by the recognition of the objects present and by the determination of their occlusion
  relations. Objects are internally represented by stored model graphs. These are
  formed in a semi-automatic way by showing objects against a varying background.
  Objects are recognized by dynamic link matching. Our experiments show that our system
  is very successful in analyzing cluttered scenes. The system architecture goes beyond
  classical neural networks by making extensive use of flexible links between units,
  as proposed in the dynamic link architecture. The present implementation is, however,
  rather algorithmic in style and is to be regarded as a pilot study that is preparing
  the way for a detailed implementation of the architecture.
