paperAbstract: Holographic Recurrent Networks (HRNs) are recurrent networks which
  incorporate associative memory techniques for storing sequential structure. HRNs
  can be easily and quickly trained using gradient descent techniques to generate
  sequences of discrete outputs and trajectories through continuous space. The performance
  of HRNs is found to be superior to that of ordinary recurrent networks on these
  sequence generation tasks.
