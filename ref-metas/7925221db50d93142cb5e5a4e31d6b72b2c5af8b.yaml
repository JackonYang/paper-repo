paperAbstract: We consider object recognition as the process of attaching meaningful
  labels to specific regions of an image, and propose a model that learns spatial
  relationships between objects. Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g.
  keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either
  a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words
  and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In
  particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop
  a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent
  probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied
  word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations,
  the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial
  consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely
  on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model
  parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop
  an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference
  step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter
  update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning
  algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images
  show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition.
  Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation
  allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes.
