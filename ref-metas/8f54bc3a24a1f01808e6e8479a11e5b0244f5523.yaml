paperAbstract: The problems arising in the modeling and coding of strings for compression
  purposes are discussed. The notion of an information source that simplifies and
  sharpens the traditional one is axiomatized, and adaptive and nonadaptive models
  are defined. With a measure of complexity assigned to the models, a fundamental
  theorem is proved which states that models that use any kind of alphabet extension
  are inferior to the best models using no alphabet extensions at all. A general class
  of so-called first-in first-out (FIFO) arithmetic codes is described which require
  no alphabet extension devices and which therefore can be used in conjunction with
  the best models. Because the coding parameters are the probabilities that define
  the model, their design is easy, and the application of the code is straightforward
  even with adaptively changing source models.
