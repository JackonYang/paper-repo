paperAbstract: We describe the design of Kaldi, a free, open-source toolkit for speech
  recognition research. Kaldi provides a speech recognition system based on finite-state
  automata (using the freely available OpenFst), together with detailed documentation
  and a comprehensive set of scripts for building complete recognition systems. Kaldi
  is written is C++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary phonetic-context
  sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace Gaussian mixture models (SGMM) as well as
  standard Gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly used linear and affine
  transforms. Kaldi is released under the Apache License v2.0, which is highly nonrestrictive,
  making it suitable for a wide community of users.
