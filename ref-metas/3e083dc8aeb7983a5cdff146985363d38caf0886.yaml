paperAbstract: Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several
  applications including robotics, surveillance and automotive safety. Much of the
  progress of the past few years has been driven by the availability of challenging
  public datasets. To continue the rapid rate of innovation, we introduce the Caltech
  Pedestrian Dataset, which is two orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets.
  The dataset contains richly annotated video, recorded from a moving vehicle, with
  challenging images of low resolution and frequently occluded people. We propose
  improved evaluation metrics, demonstrating that commonly used per-window measures
  are flawed and can fail to predict performance on full images. We also benchmark
  several promising detection systems, providing an overview of state-of-the-art performance
  and a direct, unbiased comparison of existing methods. Finally, by analyzing common
  failure cases, we help identify future research directions for the field.
