paperAbstract: "We propose a representation of images in which a global, but not a\
  \ local topology is defined. The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the\
  \ extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI's may contain many\
  \ pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information\
  \ preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI's. This can be considered\
  \ as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit\
  \ of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that\
  \ locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally,\
  \ the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale\
  \ spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (\u201Cinner scale\u201D\
  ), the extent of the ROI's (\u201Couter scale\u201D) and the resolution in the histogram\
  \ (\u201Ctonal scale\u201D). We describe how to construct locally orderless images,\
  \ how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image\
  \ processing operations."
