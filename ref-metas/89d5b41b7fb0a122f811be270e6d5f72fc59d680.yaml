paperAbstract: We propose a method for inferring human attributes (such as gender,
  hair style, clothes style, expression, action) from images of people under large
  variation of viewpoint, pose, appearance, articulation and occlusion. Convolutional
  Neural Nets (CNN) have been shown to perform very well on large scale object recognition
  problems. In the context of attribute classification, however, the signal is often
  subtle and it may cover only a small part of the image, while the image is dominated
  by the effects of pose and viewpoint. Discounting for pose variation would require
  training on very large labeled datasets which are not presently available. Part-based
  models, such as poselets [4] and DPM [12] have been shown to perform well for this
  problem but they are limited by shallow low-level features. We propose a new method
  which combines part-based models and deep learning by training pose-normalized CNNs.
  We show substantial improvement vs. state-of-the-art methods on challenging attribute
  classification tasks in unconstrained settings. Experiments confirm that our method
  outperforms both the best part-based methods on this problem and conventional CNNs
  trained on the full bounding box of the person.
