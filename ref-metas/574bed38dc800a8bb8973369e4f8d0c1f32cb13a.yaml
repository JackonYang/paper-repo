paperAbstract: We present a method to learn models of human heads for the purpose
  of detection from different viewing angles. We focus on a model where objects are
  represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented
  by a joint probability density function (PDF) on the shape of the constellation.
  In the first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in
  the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The
  set of model parameters, including the shape PDF, is then learned using expectation
  maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints
  and unseen faces. Performance is above 90% correct with less than 1 s computation
  time per image.
