paperAbstract: The ScanTab system represents a knowledge-based approach to table recognition
  in scanned documents. In contrast to most systems which recognize tables by grouping
  layout information, our system uses predefined information about which table types
  may appear in the documents. This enables a very accurate detection able to cope
  with distorted tables and tables providing little layout information, e.g., no lines,
  bad alignment, or few rows. Table recognition starts with the detection of the table
  header. Afterwards, this header is compared with table headers of known reference
  tables. Having determined the correct reference table, the information kept in the
  knowledge base is utilized to compute the complete table structure. A graphical
  user interface allows an easy and fast specification of reference tables.
