paperAbstract: 'While image registration has been studied in different areas of computer
  vision, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging problem,
  closer to recognition than to image matching. Analogous to optical flow, where an
  image is aligned to its temporally adjacent frame, we propose SIFT flow, a method
  to align an image to its neighbors in a large image collection consisting of a variety
  of scenes. For a query image, histogram intersection on a bag-of-visual-words representation
  is used to find the set of nearest neighbors in the database. The SIFT flow algorithm
  then consists of matching densely sampled SIFT features between the two images,
  while preserving spatial discontinuities. The use of SIFT features allows robust
  matching across different scene/object appearances and the discontinuity-preserving
  spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene.
  Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to robustly align complicated
  scenes with large spatial distortions. We collect a large database of videos and
  apply the SIFT flow algorithm to two applications: (i) motion field prediction from
  a single static image and (ii) motion synthesis via transfer of moving objects.'
