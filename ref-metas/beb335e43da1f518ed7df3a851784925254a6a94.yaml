paperAbstract: To understand a scene in depth not only involves locating/recognizing
  individual objects, but also requires to infer the relationships and interactions
  among them. However, since the distribution of real-world relationships is seriously
  unbalanced, existing methods perform quite poorly for the less frequent relationships.
  In this work, we find that the statistical correlations between object pairs and
  their relationships can effectively regularize semantic space and make prediction
  less ambiguous, and thus well address the unbalanced distribution issue. To achieve
  this, we incorporate these statistical correlations into deep neural networks to
  facilitate scene graph generation by developing a Knowledge-Embedded Routing Network.
  More specifically, we show that the statistical correlations between objects appearing
  in images and their relationships, can be explicitly represented by a structured
  knowledge graph, and a routing mechanism is learned to propagate messages through
  the graph to explore their interactions. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
  Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current
  state-of-the-art competitors.
