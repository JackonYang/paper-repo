paperAbstract: "Abstract We consider the problem of predicting {0, 1}-valued functions\
  \ on Rn and smaller domains, based on their values on randomly drawn points. Our\
  \ model is related to Valiant\u2032s PAC learning model, but does not require the\
  \ hypotheses used for prediction to be represented in any specified form. In our\
  \ main result we show how to construct prediction strategies that are optimal to\
  \ within a constant factor for any reasonable class F of target functions. This\
  \ result is based on new combinatorial results about classes of functions of finite\
  \ VC dimension. We also discuss more computationally efficient algorithms for predicting\
  \ indicator functions of axis-parallel rectangles, more general intersection closed\
  \ concept classes, and halfspaces in Rn. These are also optimal to within a constant\
  \ factor. Finally, we compare the general performance of prediction strategies derived\
  \ by our method to that of those derived from methods in PAC learning theory."
