paperAbstract: Memory-based classification algorithms such as radial basis functions
  or K-nearest neighbors typically rely on simple distances (Euclidean, dot product...),
  which are not particularly meaningful on pattern vectors. More complex, better suited
  distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable
  templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant
  to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently.
  We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post
  Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling,
  shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems
  tested on the same databases.
