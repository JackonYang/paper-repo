paperAbstract: This paper outlines the requirements and components for a proposed
  Document Analysis System, which assists a user in encoding printed documents for
  computer processing. Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical
  approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized
  printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing
  algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text
  lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others.
  The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds
  of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is
  constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching
  method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample
  of prototypes. Experimental results are included.
