paperAbstract: An effective algorithm for character recognition in scene images is
  studied. Scene images are segmented into regions by an image segmentation method
  based on adaptive thresholding. Character candidate regions are detected by observing
  gray-level differences between adjacent regions. To ensure extraction of multisegment
  characters as well as single-segment characters, character pattern candidates are
  obtained by associating the detected regions according to their positions and gray
  levels. A character recognition process selects patterns with high similarities
  by calculating the similarities between character pattern candidates and the standard
  patterns in a dictionary and then comparing the similarities to the thresholds.
  A relaxational approach to determine character patterns updates the similarities
  by evaluating the interactions between categories of patterns, and finally character
  patterns and their recognition results are obtained. Highly promising experimental
  results have been obtained using the method on 100 images involving characters of
  different sizes and formats under uncontrolled lighting. >
