paperAbstract: This report describes a new technique for inducing the structure of
  Hidden Markov Models from data which is based on the general `model merging' strategy
  (Omohundro 1992). The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that directly
  encodes the training data. Successively more general models are produced by merging
  HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is used to determine which
  states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The procedure may be considered a
  heuristic search for the HMM structure with the highest posterior probability. We
  discuss a variety of possible priors for HMMs, as well as a number of approximations
  which improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We studied three applications
  to evaluate the procedure. The first compares the merging algorithm with the standard
  Baum-Welch approach in inducing simple finite-state languages from small, positive-only
  training samples. We found that the merging procedure is more robust and accurate,
  particularly with a small amount of training data. The second application uses labelled
  speech data from the TIMIT database to build compact, multiple-pronunciation word
  models that can be used in speech recognition. Finally, we describe how the algorithm
  was incorporated in an operational speech understanding system, where it is combined
  with neural network acoustic likelihood estimators to improve performance over single-pronunciation
  word models.
