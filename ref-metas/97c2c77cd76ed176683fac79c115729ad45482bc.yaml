paperAbstract: 'Given a set of images containing multiple object categories, we seek
  to discover those categories and their image locations without supervision. We achieve
  this using generative models from the statistical text literature: probabilistic
  Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In text
  analysis these are used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document
  representation. Here we discover topics as object categories, so that an image containing
  instances of several categories is modelled as a mixture of topics. The models are
  applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing
  SIFT like region descriptors. We investigate a set of increasingly demanding scenarios,
  starting with image sets containing only two object categories through to sets containing
  multiple categories (including airplanes, cars, faces, motorbikes, spotted cats)
  and background clutter. The object categories sample both intra-class and scale
  variation, and both the categories and their approximate spatial layout are found
  without supervision. We also demonstrate classification of unseen images and images
  containing multiple objects. Performance of the proposed unsupervised method is
  compared to the semi-supervised approach of [7].1 1This work was sponsored in part
