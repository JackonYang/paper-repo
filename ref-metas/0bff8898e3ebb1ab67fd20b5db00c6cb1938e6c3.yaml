paperAbstract: We describe a model based on a Boltzmann machine with third-order connections
  that can learn how to accumulate information about a shape over several fixations.
  The model uses a retina that only has enough high resolution pixels to cover a small
  area of the image, so it must decide on a sequence of fixations and it must combine
  the "glimpse" at each fixation with the location of the fixation before integrating
  the information with information from other glimpses of the same object. We evaluate
  this model on a synthetic dataset and two image classification datasets, showing
  that it can perform at least as well as a model trained on whole images.
