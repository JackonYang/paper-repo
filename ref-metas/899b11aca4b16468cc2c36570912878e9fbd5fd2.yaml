paperAbstract: Text recognition in natural scenes is challenging due to the variations
  on text font, font size, color and scene background. In this paper, we propose a
  novel method to recognize scene characters based on born-digital template matching,
  which is formulated by a Morkov Random Field framework by combining both local point
  features and global spatial structures of scene characters to improve the accuracy.
  Then the character recognition result of the proposed MRF framework is determined
  by the votes from multiple one-versus-one classifiers. The experiments on two benchmark
  datasets show that the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the
  recent state-of-the-art natural scene recognition methods.
