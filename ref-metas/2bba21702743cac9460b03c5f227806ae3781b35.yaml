paperAbstract: 'We describe an approach using local features to resolve problems in
  text localization and recognition in complex scenes. Low image quality, complex
  background and variations of text make these problems challenging. Our approach
  includes the following stages: (1) Template images are generated automatically;
  (2) SIFT features are extracted and matched to template images; (3) Multiple single-character-areas
  are located using segmentation algorithm based upon multiple-size sliding subwindows;
  (4) An voting and geometric verification algorithm is used to identify final results.
  This framework thus is essentially simple by skipping many steps, such as normalization,
  binarization and OCR, which are required in previous methods. Moreover, this framework
  is robust as only SIFT feature is used. We evaluated our method using 200,000+ images
  in 3 scripts (Chinese, Japanese and Korean). We obtained average single-character
  success rate of 77.3% (highest 94.1%), average multiplecharacter success rate of
  63.9% (highest 89.6%).'
