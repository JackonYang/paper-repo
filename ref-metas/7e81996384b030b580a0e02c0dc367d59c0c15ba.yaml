paperAbstract: 'There has been considerable success in automated reconstruction for
  image sequences where small baseline algorithms can be used to establish matches
  across a number of images. In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods
  have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate
  the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where
  no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images
  are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position,
  orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data
  set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet
  wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number
  of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants,
  covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient
  multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the
  number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The
  output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from
  one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate.'
