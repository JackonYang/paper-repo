paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose to model an action based on both the shape
  and the motion of the performing object. When the object performs an action in 3D,
  the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x, y) contour
  in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates
  a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x, y, t), which can be treated as 3D object in
  the (x, y, t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface
  properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties.
  A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach
  is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive
  frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach.
  After the STV is generated, actions descriptors are computed by analyzing the differential
  geometric properties of STV. Finally, using these descriptors, we perform action
  recognition, which is also formulated as graph theoretical problem. Several experimental
  results are presented to demonstrate our approach.
