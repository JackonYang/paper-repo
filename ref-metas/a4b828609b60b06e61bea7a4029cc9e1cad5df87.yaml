paperAbstract: 'We propose a new phrase-based translation model and decoding algorithm
  that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed phrase-based
  translation models. Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments
  to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based
  models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest
  that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple
  means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and
  lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer
  than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models
  does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated
  phrases degrades the performance of our systems.'
