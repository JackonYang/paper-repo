paperAbstract: 'Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several
  applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. In recent
  years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has
  grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols
  are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we
  perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework.
  We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated,
  and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of
  the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we
  propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing
  and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale
  and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art
  detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art
  and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite
  significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. In particular,
  detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.'
