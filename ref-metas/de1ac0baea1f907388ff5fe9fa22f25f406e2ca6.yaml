paperAbstract: This paper proposes a method for human detection in crowded scene from
  static images. An individual human is modeled as an assembly of natural body parts.
  We introduce edgelet features, which are a new type of silhouette oriented features.
  Part detectors, based on these features, are learned by a boosting method. Responses
  of part detectors are combined to form a joint likelihood model that includes cases
  of multiple, possibly inter-occluded humans. The human detection problem is formulated
  as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We show results on a commonly used previous
  dataset as well as new data sets that could not be processed by earlier methods.
