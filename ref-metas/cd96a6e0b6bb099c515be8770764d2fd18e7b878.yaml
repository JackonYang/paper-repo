paperAbstract: The compositionality of meaning extends beyond the single sentence.
  Just as words combine to form the meaning of sentences, so do sentences combine
  to form the meaning of paragraphs, dialogues and general discourse. We introduce
  both a sentence model and a discourse model corresponding to the two levels of compositionality.
  The sentence model adopts convolution as the central operation for composing semantic
  vectors and is based on a novel hierarchical convolutional neural network. The discourse
  model extends the sentence model and is based on a recurrent neural network that
  is conditioned in a novel way both on the current sentence and on the current speaker.
  The discourse model is able to capture both the sequentiality of sentences and the
  interaction between different speakers. Without feature engineering or pretraining
  and with simple greedy decoding, the discourse model coupled to the sentence model
  obtains state of the art performance on a dialogue act classification experiment.
