paperAbstract: "While vector quantization (VQ) has been applied widely to generate\
  \ features for visual recognition problems, much recent work has focused on more\
  \ powerful methods. In particular, sparse coding has emerged as a strong alternative\
  \ to traditional VQ approaches and has been shown to achieve consistently higher\
  \ performance on benchmark datasets. Both approaches can be split into a training\
  \ phase, where the system learns a dictionary of basis functions, and an encoding\
  \ phase, where the dictionary is used to extract features from new inputs. In this\
  \ work, we investigate the reasons for the success of sparse coding over VQ by decoupling\
  \ these phases, allowing us to separate out the contributions of training and encoding\
  \ in a controlled way. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR, NORB and Caltech\
  \ 101 datasets, we compare several training and encoding schemes, including sparse\
  \ coding and a form of VQ with a soft threshold activation function. Our results\
  \ show not only that we can use fast VQ algorithms for training, but that we can\
  \ just as well use randomly chosen exemplars from the training set. Rather than\
  \ spend resources on training, we find it is more important to choose a good encoder\u2014\
  which can often be a simple feed forward non-linearity. Our results include state-of-the-art\
  \ performance on both CIFAR and NORB."
