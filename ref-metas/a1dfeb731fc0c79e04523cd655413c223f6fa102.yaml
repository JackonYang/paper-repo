paperAbstract: We introduce a constructive, incremental learning system for regression
  problems that models data by means of locally linear experts. In contrast to other
  approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during
  learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate
  by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a
  penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way,
  an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape
  of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant
  input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions.
  We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties
  of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed,
  prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning.
