paperAbstract: We present a 3D shape-based object recognition system for simultaneous
  recognition of multiple objects in scenes containing clutter and occlusion. Recognition
  is based on matching surfaces by matching points using the spin image representation.
  The spin image is a data level shape descriptor that is used to match surfaces represented
  as surface meshes. We present a compression scheme for spin images that results
  in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the
  simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate the robust performance of recognition in the presence of clutter
  and occlusion through analysis of recognition trials on 100 scenes.
