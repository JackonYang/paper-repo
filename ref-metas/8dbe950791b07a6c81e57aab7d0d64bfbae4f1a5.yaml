paperAbstract: The task considered in this paper is performance evaluation of region
  segmentation algorithms in the ground-truth-based paradigm. Given a machine segmentation
  and a ground-truth segmentation, performance measures are needed. We propose to
  consider the image segmentation problem as one of data clustering and, as a consequence,
  to use measures for comparing clusterings developed in statistics and machine learning.
  By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used
  before in image processing. In particular, some of these measures have the highly
  desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic
  and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others.
