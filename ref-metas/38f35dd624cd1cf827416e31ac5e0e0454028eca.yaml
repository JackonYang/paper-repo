paperAbstract: We introduce DropConnect, a generalization of Dropout (Hinton et al.,
  2012), for regularizing large fully-connected layers within neural networks. When
  training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero
  within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights
  within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of
  units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance
  of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets,
  comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recognition
  benchmarks by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.
