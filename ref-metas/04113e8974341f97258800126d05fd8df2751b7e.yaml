paperAbstract: Approximation properties of a class of artificial neural networks are
  established. It is shown that feedforward networks with one layer of sigmoidal nonlinearities
  achieve integrated squared error of order O(1/n), where n is the number of nodes.
  The approximated function is assumed to have a bound on the first moment of the
  magnitude distribution of the Fourier transform. The nonlinear parameters associated
  with the sigmoidal nodes, as well as the parameters of linear combination, are adjusted
  in the approximation. In contrast, it is shown that for series expansions with n
  terms, in which only the parameters of linear combination are adjusted, the integrated
  squared approximation error cannot be made smaller than order 1/n/sup 2/d/ uniformly
  for functions satisfying the same smoothness assumption, where d is the dimension
  of the input to the function. For the class of functions examined, the approximation
  rate and the parsimony of the parameterization of the networks are shown to be advantageous
  in high-dimensional settings. >
