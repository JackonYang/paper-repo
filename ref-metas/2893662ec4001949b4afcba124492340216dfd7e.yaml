paperAbstract: "Abstract\u2018Invariant regions\u2019 are self-adaptive image patches\
  \ that automatically deform with changing viewpoint as to keep on covering identical\
  \ physical parts of a scene. Such regions can be extracted directly from a single\
  \ image. They are then described by a set of invariant features, which makes it\
  \ relatively easy to match them between views, even under wide baseline conditions.\
  \ In this contribution, two methods to extract invariant regions are presented.\
  \ The first one starts from corners and uses the nearby edges, while the second\
  \ one is purely intensity-based. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic\
  \ system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit. This yields\
  \ more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider range of images.\
  \ To increase the robustness of the system, two semi-local constraints on combinations\
  \ of region correspondences are derived (one geometric, the other photometric).\
  \ They allow to test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely\
  \ matched regions. Experiments on images of real-world scenes taken from substantially\
  \ different viewpoints demonstrate the feasibility of the approach."
