paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we present a computational framework to engage distinctive
  feature-based theories of speech perception. Our approach involves: (i) transforming
  the signal into a collection of marked point processes, each consisting of distinctive
  feature landmarks determined by statistical learning methods, and (ii) using the
  temporal statistics of this sparse representation to probabilistically decode the
  underlying phonological sequence. In order to assess the viability of this approach,
  we benchmark our performance on broad class recognition against a range of HMM-based
  approaches using the CMU Sphinx 3 system. We find our system to be competitive with
  this baseline and conclude by outlining various avenues for future development of
  our methodology.'
