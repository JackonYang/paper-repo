paperAbstract: :tb.~tract. Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based
  on the fund~mental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate etdeulus,
  is examined with ~ view towards improving the efticieney and widening the range
  of practical applicability of these procedures. A elose analysis of the process
  of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of t ruth-funct ional
  analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be
  combined into a single new process (called resolution), i terating which is vastty
  more ef[ieient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages
  alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution
  process is presented in the form of a system of first<~rder logic with .just one
  inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is
  proved; the simplest proof-procedure based oil the system is then the direct implementation
  of the proof of completeness. Howew~r, this procedure is quite inefficient, ~nd
  the paper concludes with a discussion of several principles (called search principles)
  which are applicable to the design of efficient proof-procedures employing resolution
  as the basle logical process.
