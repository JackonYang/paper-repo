paperAbstract: We describe a component of a document analysis system for constructing
  ontologies for domain-specific web tables imported into Excel. This component automates
  extraction of the Wang Notation for the column header of a table. Using column-header
  specific rules for XY cutting we convert the geometric structure of the column header
  to a linear string denoting cell attributes and directions of cuts. The string representation
  is parsed by a context-free grammar and the parse tree is further processed to produce
  an abstract data-type representation (the Wang notation tree) of each column category.
  Experiments were carried out to evaluate this scheme on the original and edited
  column headers of Excel tables drawn from a collection of 200 used in our earlier
  work. The transformed headers were obtained by editing the original column headers
  to conform to the format targeted by our grammar. Forty-four original headers and
  their reformatted versions were submitted as input to our software system. Our grammar
  was able to parse and the extract Wang notation tree for all the edited headers,
  but for only four of the original headers. We suggest extensions to our table grammar
  that would enable processing a larger fraction of headers without manual editing.
