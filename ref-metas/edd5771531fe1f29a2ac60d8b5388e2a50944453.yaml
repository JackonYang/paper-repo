paperAbstract: What can you do with a million images? In this paper, we present a
  new image completion algorithm powered by a huge database of photographs gathered
  from the Web. The algorithm patches up holes in images by finding similar image
  regions in the database that are not only seamless, but also semantically valid.
  Our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite, the
  space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large. For many
  image completion tasks, we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments
  that will convincingly complete the image. Our algorithm is entirely data driven,
  requiring no annotations or labeling by the user. Unlike existing image completion
  methods, our algorithm can generate a diverse set of image completions and we allow
  users to select among them. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over
  existing image completion approaches.
