paperAbstract: This paper presents an approach to deriving an abstractgeometric model
  of a table from a physical representation.The technique developed uses a graph of
  constraints betweencells which must be satisfied in order to determinetheir relative
  horizontal and vertical position. The methodis evaluated with a test set of tables
  drawn from US Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.
