paperAbstract: This paper explores the use of local parametrized models of image motion
  for recovering and recognizing the non-rigid and articulated motion of human faces.
  Parametric flow models (for example affine) are popular for estimating motion in
  rigid scenes. We observe that within local regions in space and time, such models
  not only accurately model non-rigid facial motions but also provide a concise description
  of the motion in terms of a small number of parameters. These parameters are intuitively
  related to the motion of facial features during facial expressions and we show how
  expressions such as anger, happiness, surprise, fear, disgust and sadness can be
  recognized from the local parametric motions in the presence of significant head
  motion. The motion tracking and expression recognition approach performs with high
  accuracy in extensive laboratory experiments involving 40 subjects as well as in
  television and movie sequences.<<ETX>>
