paperAbstract: 'In this paper, a minimax entropy principle is studied, based on which
  a novel theory, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Minimax Entropy) is proposed
  for texture modeling. FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes
  in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling.
  It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution
  over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional
  MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and
  methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms
  are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection.
  Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and
  to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many
  textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized
  in a common framework.'
