paperAbstract: Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, P)$ be a probability space. Let $X_1, X_2,\cdots,$
  be independent $X$-valued random variables with distribution $P$. Let $P_n := n^{-1}(\delta_{X_1}
  + \cdots + \delta_{X_n})$ be the empirical measure and let $\nu_n := n^\frac{1}{2}(P_n
  - P)$. Given a class $\mathscr{C} \subset \mathscr{a}$, we study the convergence
  in law of $\nu_n$, as a stochastic process indexed by $\mathscr{C}$, to a certain
  Gaussian process indexed by $\mathscr{C}$. If convergence holds with respect to
  the supremum norm $\sup_{C \in \mathscr{C}}|f(C)|$, in a suitable (usually nonseparable)
  function space, we call $\mathscr{C}$ a Donsker class. For measurability, $X$ may
  be a complete separable metric space, $\mathscr{a} =$ Borel sets, and $\mathscr{C}$
  a suitable collection of closed sets or open sets. Then for the Donsker property
  it suffices that for some $m$, and every set $F \subset X$ with $m$ elements, $\mathscr{C}$
  does not cut all subsets of $F$ (Vapnik-Cervonenkis classes). Another sufficient
  condition is based on metric entropy with inclusion. If $\mathscr{C}$ is a sequence
  $\{C_m\}$ independent for $P$, then $\mathscr{C}$ is a Donsker class if and only
  if for some $r, \sigma_m(P(C_m)(1 - P(C_m)))^r < \infty$.
