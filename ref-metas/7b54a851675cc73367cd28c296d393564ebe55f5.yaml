paperAbstract: Wasserstein distance plays increasingly important roles in machine
  learning, stochastic programming and image processing. Major efforts have been under
  way to address its high computational complexity, some leading to approximate or
  regularized variations such as Sinkhorn distance. However, as we will demonstrate,
  several important machine learning applications call for the computation of exact
  Wasserstein distance, and regularized variations with small regularization parameter
  will fail due to numerical stability issues or degradate the performance. We address
  this challenge by developing an Inexact Proximal point method for Optimal Transport
  (IPOT) with the proximal operator approximately evaluated at each iteration using
  projections to the probability simplex. We also simplify the architecture for learning
  generative models based on optimal transport solution, and generalize the idea of
  IPOT to a new method for computing Wasserstein barycenter. We provide convergence
  analysis of IPOT and experiments showing our new methods outperform the state-of-the-art
  methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
