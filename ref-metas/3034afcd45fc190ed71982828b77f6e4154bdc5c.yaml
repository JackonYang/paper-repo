paperAbstract: Hidden Markov modeling is extended to speaker-independent phone recognition.
  Using multiple codebooks of various linear-predictive-coding (LPC) parameters and
  discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) the authors obtain a speaker-independent phone
  recognition accuracy of 58.8-73.8% on the TIMIT database, depending on the type
  of acoustic and language models used. In comparison, the performance of expert spectrogram
  readers is only 69% without use of higher level knowledge. The authors introduce
  the co-occurrence smoothing algorithm, which enables accurate recognition even with
  very limited training data. Since the results were evaluated on a standard database,
  they can be used as benchmarks to evaluate future systems. >
