paperAbstract: The probability of error in decoding an optimal convolutional code
  transmitted over a memoryless channel is bounded from above and below as a function
  of the constraint length of the code. For all but pathological channels the bounds
  are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates above R_{0} , the computational
  cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance
  of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of
  the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound
  is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which
  is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates above R_{0} and whose performance
  bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms.
