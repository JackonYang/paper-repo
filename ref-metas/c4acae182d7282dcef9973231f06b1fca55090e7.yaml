paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Vision is the construction of efficient symbolic descriptions
  from images of the world. An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations
  for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of
  the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible
  to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations
  can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent
  work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems
  assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information
  processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the
  primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional
  geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation
  of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the
  3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional
  structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes
  for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed.
