paperAbstract: World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured hypertext
  documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many
  of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small "schema" of labeled
  and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables
  project is an effort to extract and make use of the huge number of these structured
  tables on the Web. A clean collection of relational-style ta- bles could be useful
  for improving web search, schema de- sign, and many other applications. This paper
  describes the first stage of the WebTables project. First, we give an in-depth study
  of the Web's HTML table corpus. For example, we extracted 14.1 billion HTML ta-
  bles from a several-billion-page portion of Google's general- purpose web crawl,
  and estimate that 154 million of these tables contain high-quality relational-style
  data. We also de- scribe the crawl's distribution of table sizes and data types.
  Second, we describe a system for performing relation recov- ery. The Web mixes relational
  and non-relational tables indiscriminately (often on the same page), so there is
  no simple way to distinguish the 1.1% of good relations from the remainder, nor
  to recover column label and type infor- mation. Our mix of hand-written detectors
  and statistical classifiers takes a raw Web crawl as input, and generates a collection
  of databases that is five orders of magnitude larger than any other collection we
  are aware of. Relation recovery achieves precision and recall that are comparable
  to other domain-independent information extraction systems.
