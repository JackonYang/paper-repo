paperAbstract: "We integrate the cascade-of-rejectors approach with the Histograms\
  \ of Oriented Gradients (HoG) features to achieve a fast and accurate human detection\
  \ system. The features used in our system are HoGs of variable-size blocks that\
  \ capture salient features of humans automatically. Using AdaBoost for feature selection,\
  \ we identify the appropriate set of blocks, from a large set of possible blocks.\
  \ In our system, we use the integral image representation and a rejection cascade\
  \ which significantly speed up the computation. For a 320 \xD7 280 image, the system\
  \ can process 5 to 30 frames per second depending on the density in which we scan\
  \ the image, while maintaining an accuracy level similar to existing methods."
