paperAbstract: We explore the use of graph networks to deal with irregular-geometry
  detectors in the context of particle reconstruction. Thanks to their representation-learning
  capabilities, graph networks can exploit the full detector granularity, while natively
  managing the event sparsity and arbitrarily complex detector geometries. We introduce
  two distance-weighted graph network architectures, dubbed GarNet and GravNet layers,
  and apply them to a typical particle reconstruction task. The performance of the
  new architectures is evaluated on a data set of simulated particle interactions
  on a toy model of a highly granular calorimeter, loosely inspired by the endcap
  calorimeter to be installed in the CMS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC phase.
  We study the clustering of energy depositions, which is the basis for calorimetric
  particle reconstruction, and provide a quantitative comparison to alternative approaches.
  The proposed algorithms provide an interesting alternative to existing methods,
  offering equally performing or less resource-demanding solutions with less underlying
  assumptions on the detector geometry and, consequently, the possibility to generalize
  to other detectors.
