paperAbstract: "Transformation-based learning, a technique introduced by Eric Brill\
  \ (1993b), has been shown to do part-of-speech tagging with fairly high accuracy.\
  \ This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for\
  \ locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201CbaseNP\u201D\
  \ chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem\
  \ by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic\
  \ tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision\
  \ rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat\
  \ more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working\
  \ in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required\
  \ some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."
