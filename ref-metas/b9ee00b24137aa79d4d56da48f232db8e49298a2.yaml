paperAbstract: "The goal of this work is to detect hand and arm positions over continuous\
  \ sign language video sequences of more than one hour in length. We cast the problem\
  \ as inference in a generative model of the image. Under this model, limb detection\
  \ is expensive due to the very large number of \npossible configurations each part\
  \ can assume. We make the following contributions to reduce this cost: (i) using\
  \ efficient sampling from a pictorial structure proposal distribution to obtain\
  \ reasonable configurations; (ii) identifying a large set of frames where correct\
  \ configurations can be inferred, and using temporal tracking elsewhere. Results\
  \ are reported for signing footage with changing background, challenging image conditions,\
  \ and different signers; and we show that the method is able to identify the true\
  \ arm and hand locations. The results exceed the state-of-the-art for the length\
  \ and stability of continuous limb tracking."
