paperAbstract: 'Image analysis and graphics synthesis can be achieved with learning
  techniques using directly image examples without physically-based, 3D models. In
  our technique: -- the mapping from novel images to a vector of ``pose'''''''' and
  ``expression'''''''' parameters can be learned from a small set of example images
  using a function approximation technique that we call an {\it analysis network};
  -- the inverse mapping from input ``pose'''''''' and ``expression'''''''' parameters
  to output images can be synthesized from a small set of example images and used
  to produce new images using a similar {\it synthesis network}. The techniques described
  here have several applications in computer graphics, special effects, interactive
  multimedia and very low bandwidth teleconferencing.'
