paperAbstract: 'This book uses the methodology of artificial intelligence to investigate
  the phenomena of visual motion perception: how the visual system constructs descriptions
  of the environment in terms of objects, their three-dimensional shape, and their
  motion through space, on the basis of the changing image that reaches the eye. The
  author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis.
  Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have
  been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the
  visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first,
  the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements
  that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual
  identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional
  interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The
  author''s computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it
  should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers
  interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested
  in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science.'
