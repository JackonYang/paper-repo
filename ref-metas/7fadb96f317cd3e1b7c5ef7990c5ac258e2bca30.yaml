paperAbstract: Recognizing text from natural images is a hot research topic in computer
  vision due to its various applications. Despite the enduring research of several
  decades on optical character recognition (OCR), recognizing texts from natural images
  is still a challenging task. This is because scene texts are often in irregular
  (e.g. curved, arbitrarily-oriented or seriously distorted) arrangements, which have
  not yet been well addressed in the literature. Existing methods on text recognition
  mainly work with regular (horizontal and frontal) texts and cannot be trivially
  generalized to handle irregular texts. In this paper, we develop the arbitrary orientation
  network (AON) to directly capture the deep features of irregular texts, which are
  combined into an attention-based decoder to generate character sequence. The whole
  network can be trained end-to-end by using only images and word-level annotations.
  Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the CUTE80, SVT-Perspective,
  IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the proposed AON-based method achieves
  the-state-of-the-art performance in irregular datasets, and is comparable to major
  existing methods in regular datasets.
