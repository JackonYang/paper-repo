paperAbstract: "The present memoir is the outcome of an attempt to obtain the conditions\
  \ under which a given symmetric and continuous function k ( s, t ) is definite,\
  \ in the sense of Hilbert. At an early stage, however, it was found that the class\
  \ of definite functions was too restricted to allow the determination of necessary\
  \ and sufficient conditions in terms of the determinants of \xA7 10. The discovery\
  \ that this could be done for functions of positive or negative type, and the fact\
  \ that almost all the theorems which are true of definite functions are, with slight\
  \ modification, true of these, led finally to the abandonment of the original plan\
  \ in favour of a discussion of the properties of functions belonging to the wider\
  \ classes. The first part of the memoir is devoted to the definition of various\
  \ terms employed, and to the re-statement of the consequences which follow from\
  \ Hilbert\u2019s theorem."
