paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a dependency tree-based method for sentiment
  classification of Japanese and English subjective sentences using conditional random
  fields with hidden variables. Subjective sentences often contain words which reverse
  the sentiment polarities of other words. Therefore, interactions between words need
  to be considered in sentiment classification, which is difficult to be handled with
  simple bag-of-words approaches, and the syntactic dependency structures of subjective
  sentences are exploited in our method. In the method, the sentiment polarity of
  each dependency subtree in a sentence, which is not observable in training data,
  is represented by a hidden variable. The polarity of the whole sentence is calculated
  in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. Sum-product belief
  propagation is used for inference. Experimental results of sentiment classification
  for Japanese and English subjective sentences showed that the method performs better
  than other methods based on bag-of-features.
