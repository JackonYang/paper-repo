paperAbstract: We describe a system for representing moving images with sets of overlapping
  layers. Each layer contains an intensity map that defines the additive values of
  each pixel, along with an alpha map that serves as a mask indicating the transparency.
  The layers are ordered in depth and they occlude each other in accord with the rules
  of compositing. Velocity maps define how the layers are to be warped over time.
  The layered representation is more flexible than standard image transforms and can
  capture many important properties of natural image sequences. We describe some methods
  for decomposing image sequences into layers using motion analysis, and we discuss
  how the representation may be used for image coding and other applications.
