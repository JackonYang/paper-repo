paperAbstract: "We propose a new unsupervised learning method to obtain a layered\
  \ pictorial structure (LPS) representation of an articulated object from video sequences.\
  \ It will be seen that this is related in turn to methods for learning sprite based\
  \ representations of an image. The method we describe involves a new generative\
  \ model for performing segmentation on a set of images. Included in this model are\
  \ the effects of motion blur and occlusion. An initial estimate of the parameters\
  \ of the model is obtained by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components.\
  \ The estimate of the matte of each part is refined using a variation of the \u03B1\
  -expansion graph cut algorithm. This method has the advantage of achieving a strong\
  \ local minimum over labels. Results are demonstrated on animals for which an articulated\
  \ LPS representation is naturally suited."
