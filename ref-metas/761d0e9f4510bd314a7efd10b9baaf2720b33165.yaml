paperAbstract: The perception of objects is a well-developed field, but the perception
  of materials has been studied rather little. This is surprising given how important
  materials are for humans, and how important they must become for intelligent robots.
  We may learn something by looking at other fields in which material appearance is
  recognized as important. Classical artists were highly skilled at generating convincing
  materials. The simulation of material appearance is a topic of great importance
  in 3D computer graphics. Some fields, such as mineralogy, use the concept of a 'habit'
  which is a combination of shape and texture, and which may be used for characterizing
  certain objects or materials. We have recently taken steps toward material recognition
  by machines, using techniques derived from the domain of texture analysis.
