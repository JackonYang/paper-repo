paperAbstract: The goal of this work is to accurately detect and localize boundaries
  in natural scenes using local image measurements. We formulate features that respond
  to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural
  boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal
  way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output
  of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image
  location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting
  detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are
  1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and
  2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries
  in natural images.
