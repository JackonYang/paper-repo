paperAbstract: "Work on modeling semantics in text is progressing quickly, yet currently\
  \ there are few public datasets which authors can use to measure and compare their\
  \ systems. This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the\
  \ MSR Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each\
  \ of which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original\
  \ sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence statistics.\
  \ For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five choices for\
  \ that word is the correct one. This dataset was constructed from Project Gutenberg\
  \ data. Seed sentences were selected from five of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s\
  \ Sherlock Holmes novels, and then imposter words were suggested with the aid of\
  \ a language model trained on over 500 19th century novels. The language model was\
  \ used to compute 30 alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence,\
  \ and human judges then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided\
  \ guidelines. Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still\
  \ a work in progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources.\
  \ This technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as\
  \ new datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example,\
  \ using human subjects) are reported."
