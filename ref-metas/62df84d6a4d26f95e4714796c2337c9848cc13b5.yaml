paperAbstract: "MXNet is a multi-language machine learning (ML) library to ease the\
  \ development of ML algorithms, especially for deep neural networks. Embedded in\
  \ the host language, it blends declarative symbolic expression with imperative tensor\
  \ computation. It offers auto differentiation to derive gradients. MXNet is computation\
  \ and memory efficient and runs on various heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile\
  \ devices to distributed GPU clusters. \nThis paper describes both the API design\
  \ and the system implementation of MXNet, and explains how embedding of both symbolic\
  \ expression and tensor operation is handled in a unified fashion. Our preliminary\
  \ experiments reveal promising results on large scale deep neural network applications\
  \ using multiple GPU machines."
