paperAbstract: Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is a novel statistical technique
  for the analysis of two-mode and co-occurrence data, which has applications in information
  retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text,
  and in related areas. Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems
  from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence
  tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent
  class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation
  in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization
  of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial
  and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.
