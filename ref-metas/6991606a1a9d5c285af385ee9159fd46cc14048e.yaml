paperAbstract: The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary
  component of data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks.
  Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional
  information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate
  fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting
  and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however.
  This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction,
  and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the
  use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result,
  they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government
  statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent
  lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also
  discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding
  cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells.
