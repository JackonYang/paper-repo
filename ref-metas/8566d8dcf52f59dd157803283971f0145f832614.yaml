paperAbstract: From a Bayesian decision theoretic framework, we show that the reason
  why the usual statistical approaches do not take context into account is because
  of the assumptions made on the joint prior probability function and because of the
  simplistic loss function chosen. We illustrate how the constraints sometimes employed
  by artificial intelligence researchers constitute a different kind of assumption
  on the joint prior probability function. We discuss a couple of loss functions which
  do take context into account and when combined with the joint prior probability
  constraint create a decision problem requiring a combinatorial state space search.
  We also give a theory for how probabilistic relaxation works from a Bayesian point
  of view.
