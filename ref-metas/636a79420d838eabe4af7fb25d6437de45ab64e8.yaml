paperAbstract: "We present RACE, a new dataset for benchmark evaluation of methods\
  \ in the reading comprehension task. Collected from the English exams for middle\
  \ and high school Chinese students in the age range between 12 to 18, RACE consists\
  \ of near 28,000 passages and near 100,000 questions generated by human experts\
  \ (English instructors), and covers a variety of topics which are carefully designed\
  \ for evaluating the students\u2019 ability in understanding and reasoning. In particular,\
  \ the proportion of questions that requires reasoning is much larger in RACE than\
  \ that in other benchmark datasets for reading comprehension, and there is a significant\
  \ gap between the performance of the state-of-the-art models (43%) and the ceiling\
  \ human performance (95%). We hope this new dataset can serve as a valuable resource\
  \ for research and evaluation in machine comprehension. The dataset is freely available\
  \ at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~glai1/data/race/ and the code is available at https://github.com/qizhex/RACE_AR_baselines."
