paperAbstract: Interpretation of images and videos containing humans interacting with
  different objects is a daunting task. It involves understanding scene or event,
  analyzing human movements, recognizing manipulable objects, and observing the effect
  of the human movement on those objects. While each of these perceptual tasks can
  be conducted independently, recognition rate improves when interactions between
  them are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we
  present a Bayesian approach which integrates various perceptual tasks involved in
  understanding human-object interactions. Previous approaches to object and action
  recognition rely on static shape or appearance feature matching and motion analysis,
  respectively. Our approach goes beyond these traditional approaches and applies
  spatial and functional constraints on each of the perceptual elements for coherent
  semantic interpretation. Such constraints allow us to recognize objects and actions
  when the appearances are not discriminative enough. We also demonstrate the use
  of such constraints in recognition of actions from static images without using any
  motion information.
