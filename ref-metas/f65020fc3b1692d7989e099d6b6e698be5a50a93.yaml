paperAbstract: We consider learning in a Markov decision process where we are not
  explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating
  the task that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in applications
  (such as the task of driving) where it may be difficult to write down an explicit
  reward function specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off.
  We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible
  as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the
  task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement
  learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm
  terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover
  the expert's reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance
  close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to
  the expert's unknown reward function.
