paperAbstract: "The backpropagation learning algorithm for neural networks is developed\
  \ into a formalism for nonlinear signal processing. We illustrate the method by\
  \ selecting two common topics in signal processing, prediction and system modelling,\
  \ and show that nonlinear applications can be handled extremely well by using neural\
  \ networks. The formalism is a natural, nonlinear extension of the linear Least\
  \ Mean Squares algorithm commonly used in adaptive signal processing. Simulations\
  \ are presented that document the additional performance achieved by using nonlinear\
  \ neural networks. First, we demonstrate that the formalism may be used to predict\
  \ points in a highly chaotic time series with orders of magnitude increase in accuracy\
  \ over conventional methods including the Linear Predictive Method and the Gabor-Volterra-Weiner\
  \ Polynomial Method. Deterministic chaos is thought to be involved in many physical\
  \ situations including the onset of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions and\
  \ plasma physics. Secondly, we demonstrate the use of the formalism in nonlinear\
  \ system modelling by providing a graphic example in which it is clear that the\
  \ neural network has accurately modelled the nonlinear transfer function. It is\
  \ interesting to note that the formalism provides explicit, analytic, global, approximations\
  \ to the nonlinear maps underlying the various time series. Furthermore, the neural\
  \ net more\_\xBB seems to be extremely parsimonious in its requirements for data\
  \ points from the time series. We show that the neural net is able to perform well\
  \ because it globally approximates the relevant maps by performing a kind of generalized\
  \ mode decomposition of the maps. 24 refs., 13 figs. \xAB\_less"
