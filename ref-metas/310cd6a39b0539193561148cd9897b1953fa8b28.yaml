paperAbstract: "Unsupervised Information Extraction (UIE) is the task of extracting\
  \ knowledge from text without using hand-tagged training examples. A fundamental\
  \ problem for both UIE and supervised IE is assessing the probability that extracted\
  \ information is correct. In massive corpora such as the Web, the same extraction\
  \ is found repeatedly in different documents. How does this redundancy impact the\
  \ probability of correctness? \n \nThis paper introduces a combinatorial \"balls-andurns\"\
  \ model that computes the impact of sample size, redundancy, and corroboration from\
  \ multiple distinct extraction rules on the probability that an extraction is correct.\
  \ We describe methods for estimating the model's parameters in practice and demonstrate\
  \ experimentally that for UIE the model's log likelihoods are 15 times better, on\
  \ average, than those obtained by Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and the noisy-or\
  \ model used in previous work. For supervised IE, the model's performance is comparable\
  \ to that of Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression."
