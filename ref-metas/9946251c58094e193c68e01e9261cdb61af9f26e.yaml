paperAbstract: 'We focus on knowledge base construction (KBC) from richly formatted
  data. In contrast to KBC from text or tabular data, KBC from richly formatted data
  aims to extract relations conveyed jointly via textual, structural, tabular, and
  visual expressions. We introduce Fonduer, a machine-learning-based KBC system for
  richly formatted data. Fonduer presents a new data model that accounts for three
  challenging characteristics of richly formatted data: (1) prevalent document-level
  relations, (2) multimodality, and (3) data variety. Fonduer uses a new deep-learning
  model to automatically capture the representation (i.e., features) needed to learn
  how to extract relations from richly formatted data. Finally, Fonduer provides a
  new programming model that enables users to convert domain expertise, based on multiple
  modalities of information, to meaningful signals of supervision for training a KBC
  system. Fonduer-based KBC systems are in production for a range of use cases, including
  at a major online retailer. We compare Fonduer against state-of-the-art KBC approaches
  in four different domains. We show that Fonduer achieves an average improvement
  of 41 F1 points on the quality of the output knowledge base---and in some cases
  produces up to 1.87x the number of correct entries---compared to expert-curated
  public knowledge bases. We also conduct a user study to assess the usability of
  Fonduer''s new programming model. We show that after using Fonduer for only 30 minutes,
  non-domain experts are able to design KBC systems that achieve on average 23 F1
  points higher quality than traditional machine-learning-based KBC approaches.'
