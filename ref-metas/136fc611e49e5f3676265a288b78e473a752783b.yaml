paperAbstract: A novel unsupervised neural network for dimensionality reduction that
  seeks directions emphasizing multimodality is presented, and its connection to exploratory
  projection pursuit methods is discussed. This leads to a new statistical insight
  into the synaptic modification equations governing learning in Bienenstock, Cooper,
  and Munro (BCM) neurons (1982). The importance of a dimensionality reduction principle
  based solely on distinguishing features is demonstrated using a phoneme recognition
  experiment. The extracted features are compared with features extracted using a
  backpropagation network.
