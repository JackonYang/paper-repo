paperAbstract: Computer vision with state-of-the-art deep learning models has achieved
  huge success in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) including text
  detection and recognition tasks recently. However, Key Information Extraction (KIE)
  from documents as the downstream task of OCR, having a large number of use scenarios
  in real-world, remains a challenge because documents not only have textual features
  extracting from OCR systems but also have semantic visual features that are not
  fully exploited and play a critical role in KIE. Too little work has been devoted
  to efficiently make full use of both textual and visual features of the documents.
  In this paper, we introduce PICK, a framework that is effective and robust in handling
  complex documents layout for KIE by combining graph learning with graph convolution
  operation, yielding a richer semantic representation containing the textual and
  visual features and global layout without ambiguity. Extensive experiments on realworld
  datasets have been conducted to show that our method outperforms baselines methods
  by significant margins. Our code is available at https://github.com/wenwenyu/PICK-pytorch.
