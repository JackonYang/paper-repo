paperAbstract: While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document
  analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the
  field, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms that incorporate
  more complex structure have been less successful. We describe an intuitive, easy-to-implement
  scheme for the problem of performance evaluation when document recognition results
  are represented in the form of a directed acyclic graph. We present results from
  two simulation studies based on different graph models and one experiment using
  a well known page segmentation algorithm to demonstrate the applicability of the
  approach.
