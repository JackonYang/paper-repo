paperAbstract: The problem of how three-dimensional form is perceived in spite of
  the fact that pertinent stimulation consists only in two-dimensional retinal images
  has been only partly solved. Much is known about the impressive effectiveness of
  binocular disparity. However, the excellent perception of threedimensional form
  in monocular vision has remained essentially unexplained. It has been proposed that
  some patterns of stimulation on the retina give rise to three-dimensional experiences,
  because visual processes differ in the spontaneous organization that results from
  certain properties of the retinal pattern. Rules of organization are supposed to
  exist according to which most retinal projections of three-dimensional forms happen
  to produce three-dimensional percepts and most retinal images of flat forms lead
  to flat forms in experience also. This view has been held mainly by gestalt psychologists.
  Another approach to this problem maintains that the projected stimulus patterns
  are interpreted on the basis of previous experience, either visual
