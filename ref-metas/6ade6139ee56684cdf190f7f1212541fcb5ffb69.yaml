paperAbstract: An apparatus for hydrolytic degradation of plastics in which plastic
  material is deposited into a tubular housing via a feed hopper. An elongated screw
  shaft has a first section in the form of a high pitch screw thread disposed below
  the feed hopper to receive and advance the material to a second section. The second
  section of the screw shaft is in the form of a lower pitch thread for compressing
  the plastic material and transferring it to a longer, third section in the form
  of kneading discs, from which material passes through an outlet nozzle section to
  a cyclone separator where trapped gases and liquid may be withdrawn. The tubular
  housing is vented upstream of the feed hopper and a water inlet pipe is disposed
  adjacent to the second section of the screw shaft, downstream of the feed hopper.
  The outlet nozzle section is provided with pressure measuring and regulating means
  and a liquid level measuring and regulating device.
