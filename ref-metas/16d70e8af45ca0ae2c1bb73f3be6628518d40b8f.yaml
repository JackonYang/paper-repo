paperAbstract: The emergence of a feature-analyzing function from the development
  rules of simple, multilayered networks is explored. It is shown that even a single
  developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties
  that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive
  signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence,
  and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These
  results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied
  to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed
  is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount
  of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing
  stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated
  for some simple cases.<<ETX>>
