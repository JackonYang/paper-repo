paperAbstract: The problem of detecting and recognizing text in natural scenes has
  proved to be more challenging than its counterpart in documents, with most of the
  previous work focusing on a single part of the problem. In this work, we propose
  new solutions to the character and word recognition problems and then show how to
  combine these solutions in an end-to-end text-recognition system. We do so by leveraging
  the recently introduced Maxout networks along with hybrid HMM models that have proven
  useful for voice recognition. Using these elements, we build a tunable and highly
  accurate recognition system that beats state-of-the-art results on all the sub-problems
  for both the ICDAR 2003 and SVT benchmark datasets.
