paperAbstract: This paper shows how to construct semantic representations from the
  derivations produced by a wide-coverage CCG parser. Unlike the dependency structures
  returned by the parser itself, these can be used directly for semantic interpretation.
  We demonstrate that well-formed semantic representations can be produced for over
  97% of the sentences in unseen WSJ text. We believe this is a major step towards
  widecoverage semantic interpretation, one of the key objectives of the field of
  NLP.
