paperAbstract: The economic feasibility of maintaining large data bases of document
  images has created a tremendous demand for robust ways to access and manipulate
  the information these images contain. In an attempt to move toward a paperless office,
  large quantities of printed documents are often scanned and archived as images,
  without adequate index information. One way to provide traditional data-base indexing
  and retrieval capabilities is to fully convert the document to an electronic representation
  which can be indexed automatically. Unfortunately, there are many factors which
  prohibit complete conversion including high cost, low document quality, and the
  fact that many nontext components cannot be adequately represented in a converted
  form. In such cases, it can be advantageous to maintain a copy of and use the document
  in image form. In this paper, we provide a survey of methods developed by researchers
  to access and manipulate document images without the need for complete and accurate
  conversion. We briefly discuss traditional text indexing techniques on imperfect
  data and the retrieval of partially converted documents. This is followed by a more
  comprehensive review of techniques for the direct characterization, manipulation,
  and retrieval, of images of documents containing text, graphics, and scene images.
