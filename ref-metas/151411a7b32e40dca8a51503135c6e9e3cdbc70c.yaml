paperAbstract: The development of natural language interfaces (NLI's) for databases
  has been a challenging problem in natural language processing (NLP) since the 1970's.
  The need for NLI's has become more pronounced due to the widespread access to complex
  databases now available through the Internet. A challenging problem for empirical
  NLP is the automated acquisition of NLI's from training examples. We present a method
  for integrating statistical and relational learning techniques for this task which
  exploits the strength of both approaches. Experimental results from three different
  domains suggest that such an approach is more robust than a previous purely logic-based
  approach.
