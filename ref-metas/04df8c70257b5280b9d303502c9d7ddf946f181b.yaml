paperAbstract: Visually rich documents (VRDs) are ubiquitous in daily business and
  life. Examples are purchase receipts, insurance policy documents, custom declaration
  forms and so on. In VRDs, visual and layout information is critical for document
  understanding, and texts in such documents cannot be serialized into the one-dimensional
  sequence without losing information. Classic information extraction models such
  as BiLSTM-CRF typically operate on text sequences and do not incorporate visual
  features. In this paper, we introduce a graph convolution based model to combine
  textual and visual information presented in VRDs. Graph embeddings are trained to
  summarize the context of a text segment in the document, and further combined with
  text embeddings for entity extraction. Extensive experiments have been conducted
  to show that our method outperforms BiLSTM-CRF baselines by significant margins,
  on two real-world datasets. Additionally, ablation studies are also performed to
  evaluate the effectiveness of each component of our model.
