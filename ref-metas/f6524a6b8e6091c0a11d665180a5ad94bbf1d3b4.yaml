paperAbstract: There has been a great deal of theoretical and experimental work in
  computer science on inductive inference systems, that is, systems that try to infer
  general rules from examples. However, a complete and applicable theory of such systems
  is still a distant goal. This survey highlights and explains the main ideas that
  have been developed in the study of inductive inference, with special emphasis on
  the relations between the general theory and the specific algorithms and implementations.
