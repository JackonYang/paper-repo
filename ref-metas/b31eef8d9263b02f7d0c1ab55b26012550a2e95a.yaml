paperAbstract: Open Information Extraction (OpenIE), the problem of harvesting triples
  from natural language text whose predicate relations are not aligned to any pre-defined
  ontology, has been a popular subject of research for the last decade. However, this
  research has largely ignored the vast quantity of facts available in semi-structured
  webpages. In this paper, we define the problem of OpenIE from semi-structured websites
  to extract such facts, and present an approach for solving it. We also introduce
  a labeled evaluation dataset to motivate research in this area. Given a semi-structured
  website and a set of seed facts for some relations existing on its pages, we employ
  a semi-supervised label propagation technique to automatically create training data
  for the relations present on the site. We then use this training data to learn a
  classifier for relation extraction. Experimental results of this method on our new
  benchmark dataset obtained a precision of over 70%. A larger scale extraction experiment
  on 31 websites in the movie vertical resulted in the extraction of over 2 million
  triples.
