paperAbstract: "Markov and Conditional random fields (CRFs) used in computer vision\
  \ typically model only local interactions between variables, as this is computationally\
  \ tractable. In this paper we consider a class of global potentials defined over\
  \ all variables in the CRF. We show how they can be readily optimised using standard\
  \ graph cut algorithms at little extra expense compared to a standard pairwise field.\
  \ \n \nThis result can be directly used for the problem of class based image segmentation\
  \ which has seen increasing recent interest within computer vision. Here the aim\
  \ is to assign a label to each pixel of a given image from a set of possible object\
  \ classes. Typically these methods use random fields to model local interactions\
  \ between pixels or super-pixels. One of the cues that helps recognition is global\
  \ object co-occurrence statistics, a measure of which classes (such as chair or\
  \ motorbike) are likely to occur in the same image together. There have been several\
  \ approaches proposed to exploit this property, but all of them suffer from different\
  \ limitations and typically carry a high computational cost, preventing their application\
  \ on large images. We find that the new model we propose produces an improvement\
  \ in the labelling compared to just using a pairwise model."
