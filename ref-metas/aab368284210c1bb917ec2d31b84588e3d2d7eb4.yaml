paperAbstract: 'Over the last years, deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
  have transformed the field of computer vision thanks to their unparalleled capacity
  to learn high level semantic image features. However, in order to successfully learn
  those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which
  is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature
  learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial
  importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that
  are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training
  ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets
  as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that this apparently
  simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature
  learning. We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning
  benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance. Specifically,
  our results on those benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements w.r.t. prior state-of-the-art
  approaches in unsupervised representation learning and thus significantly close
  the gap with supervised feature learning. For instance, in PASCAL VOC 2007 detection
  task our unsupervised pre-trained AlexNet model achieves the state-of-the-art (among
  unsupervised methods) mAP of 54.4% that is only 2.4 points lower from the supervised
  case. We get similarly striking results when we transfer our unsupervised learned
  features on various other tasks, such as ImageNet classification, PASCAL classification,
  PASCAL segmentation, and CIFAR-10 classification. The code and models of our paper
  will be published on: this https URL .'
