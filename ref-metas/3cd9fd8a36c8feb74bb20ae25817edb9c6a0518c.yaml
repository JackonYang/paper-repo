paperAbstract: 'This paper presents context-group discrimination, a disambiguation
  algorithm based on clustering. Senses are interpreted as groups (or clusters) of
  similar contexts of the ambiguous word. Words, contexts, and senses are represented
  in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued space in which closeness corresponds
  to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence:
  two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense cluster
  if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus.
  The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses
  are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge
  sources. The paper demonstrates good performance of context-group discrimination
  for a sample of natural and artificial ambiguous words.'
