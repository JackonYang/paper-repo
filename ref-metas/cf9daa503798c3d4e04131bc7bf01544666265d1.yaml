paperAbstract: "A large number of images with ground truth object bounding boxes are\
  \ critical for learning object detectors, which is a fundamental task in compute\
  \ vision. In this paper, we study strategies to crowd-source bounding box annotations.\
  \ The core challenge of building such a system is to effectively control the data\
  \ quality with minimal cost. Our key observation is that drawing a bounding box\
  \ is significantly more difficult and time consuming than giving answers to multiple\
  \ choice questions. Thus quality control through additional verification tasks is\
  \ more cost effective than consensus based algorithms. In particular, we present\
  \ a system that consists of three simple sub-tasks \u2014 a drawing task, a quality\
  \ verification task and a coverage verification task. Experimental results demonstrate\
  \ that our system is scalable, accurate, and cost-effective."
