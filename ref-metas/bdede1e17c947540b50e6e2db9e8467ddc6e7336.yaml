paperAbstract: Horn formulae play a prominent role in artificial intelligence and
  logic programming. In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression
  of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to
  this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base,
  leads to an "irredundant" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here
  that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional
  variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order
  to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a
  knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models
  of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge
  bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove
  that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn
  knowledge bases) is...
