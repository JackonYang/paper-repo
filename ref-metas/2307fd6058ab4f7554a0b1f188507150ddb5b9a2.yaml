paperAbstract: We introduce the independent factor analysis (IFA) method for recovering
  independent hidden sources from their observed mixtures. IFA generalizes and unifies
  ordinary factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent
  component analysis (ICA), and can handle not only square noiseless mixing but also
  the general case where the number of mixtures differs from the number of sources
  and the data are noisy. IFA is a two-step procedure. In the first step, the source
  densities, mixing matrix, and noise covariance are estimated from the observed data
  by maximum likelihood. For this purpose we present an expectation-maximization (EM)
  algorithm, which performs unsupervised learning of an associated probabilistic model
  of the mixing situation. Each source in our model is described by a mixture of gaussians;
  thus, all the probabilistic calculations can be performed analytically. In the second
  step, the sources are reconstructed from the observed data by an optimal nonlinear
  estimator. A variational approximation of this algorithm is derived for cases with
  a large number of sources, where the exact algorithm becomes intractable. Our IFA
  algorithm reduces to the one for ordinary FA when the sources become gaussian, and
  to an EM algorithm for PCA in the zero-noise limit. We derive an additional EM algorithm
  specifically for noiseless IFA. This algorithm is shown to be superior to ICA since
  it can learn arbitrary source densities from the data. Beyond blind separation,
  IFA can be used for modeling multidimensional data by a highly constrained mixture
  of gaussians and as a tool for nonlinear signal encoding.
