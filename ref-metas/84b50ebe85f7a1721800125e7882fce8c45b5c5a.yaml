paperAbstract: 'We investigate the fine grained object categorization problem of determining
  the breed of animal from an image. To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset
  of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very
  challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can
  be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions:
  first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image.
  The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet
  face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur.
  Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second,
  we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is
  first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in
  which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and
  image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously
  published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When
  applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models
  obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the
  difficulty of the problem.'
