paperAbstract: "Extracting named entities in text and linking extracted names to a\
  \ given knowledge base are fundamental tasks in applications for text understanding.\
  \ Existing systems typically run a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract\
  \ entity names first, then run an entity linking model to link extracted names to\
  \ a knowledge base. NER and linking models are usually trained separately, and the\
  \ mutual dependency between the two tasks is ignored. We propose JERL, Joint Entity\
  \ Recognition and Linking, to jointly model NER and linking tasks and capture the\
  \ mutual dependency between them. It allows the information from each task to improve\
  \ the performance of the other. To the best of our knowledge, JERL is the first\
  \ model to jointly optimize NER and linking tasks together completely. In experiments\
  \ on the CoNLL\u201903/AIDA data set, JERL outperforms state-of-art NER and linking\
  \ systems, and we find improvements of 0.4% absolute F1 for NER on CoNLL\u201903,\
  \ and 0.36% absolute precision@1 for linking on AIDA."
