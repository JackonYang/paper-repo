paperAbstract: The first of these questions is in the province of sensory physiology,
  and is the only one for which appreciable understanding has been achieved. This
  article will be concerned primarily with the second and third questions, which are
  still subject to a vast amount of speculation, and where the few relevant facts
  currently supplied by neurophysiology have not yet been integrated into an acceptable
  theory. With regard to the second question, two alternative positions have been
  maintained. The first suggests that storage of sensory information is in the form
  of coded representations or images, with some sort of one-to-one mapping between
  the sensory stimulus
