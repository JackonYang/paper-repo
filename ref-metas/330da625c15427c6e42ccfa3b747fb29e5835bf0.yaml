paperAbstract: 'We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous
  vector

  representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these

  representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are

  compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types

  of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower

  computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word

  vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these

  vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring

  syntactic and semantic word similarities.'
