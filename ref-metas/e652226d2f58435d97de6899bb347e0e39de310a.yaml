paperAbstract: We present in this paper experiments on Table Recognition in hand-written
  register books. We first explain how the problem of row and column detection is
  modelled, and then compare two Machine Learning approaches (Conditional Random Field
  and Graph Convolutional Network) for detecting these table elements. Evaluation
  was conducted on death records provided by the Archives of the Diocese of Passau.
  With an F-1 score of 89, both methods provide a quality which allows for Information
  Extraction. Software and dataset are open source/data.
