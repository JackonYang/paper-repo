paperAbstract: "Abstract. Searching for documents by their type or genre is a natural\
  \ way to enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval. The layout of a document\
  \ contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify it by\
  \ type in the absence of domain-specific models. Our approach to classification\
  \ is based on \u201Cvisual similarity\u201D of layout structure and is implemented\
  \ by building a supervised classifier, given examples of each class. We use image\
  \ features such as percentages of text and non-text (graphics, images, tables, and\
  \ rulings) content regions, column structures, relative point sizes of fonts, density\
  \ of content area, and statistics of features of connected components which can\
  \ be derived without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training\
  \ samples, we conducted a study where subjects ranked document pages with respect\
  \ to their resemblance to representative page images. Class labels can also be assigned\
  \ based on known document types, or can be defined by the user. We implemented our\
  \ classification scheme using decision tree classifiers and self-organizing maps."
