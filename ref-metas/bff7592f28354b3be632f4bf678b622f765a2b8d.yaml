paperAbstract: "Table spotting and structural analysis are just a small fraction of\
  \ tasks relevant when speaking of table analysis. Today, quite a large number of\
  \ different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are\
  \ available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on\
  \ the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of\
  \ detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different\
  \ strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others\
  \ perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his\
  \ specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison\
  \ of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing\
  \ their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete\
  \ and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting\
  \ and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and\
  \ evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we\
  \ also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets\
  \ that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results\
  \ that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and\
  \ which we started to further advance since a few months."
