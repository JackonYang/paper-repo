paperAbstract: 'Driven by the wide range of applications, scene text detection and
  recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. Though extensively
  studied, localizing and reading text in uncontrolled environments remain extremely
  challenging, due to various interference factors. In this paper, we propose a novel
  multi-scale representation for scene text recognition. This representation consists
  of a set of detectable primitives, termed as strokelets, which capture the essential
  substructures of characters at different granularities. Strokelets possess four
  distinctive advantages: (1) Usability: automatically learned from bounding box labels,
  (2) Robustness: insensitive to interference factors, (3) Generality: applicable
  to variant languages, and (4) Expressivity: effective at describing characters.
  Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks verify the advantages of strokelets
  and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for text recognition.'
