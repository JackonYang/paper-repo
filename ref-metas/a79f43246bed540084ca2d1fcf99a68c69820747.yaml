paperAbstract: Text detection and localization in natural scene images is important
  for content-based image analysis. This problem is challenging due to the complex
  background, the non-uniform illumination, the variations of text font, size and
  line orientation. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to robustly detect
  and localize texts in natural scene images. A text region detector is designed to
  estimate the text existing confidence and scale information in image pyramid, which
  help segment candidate text components by local binarization. To efficiently filter
  out the non-text components, a conditional random field (CRF) model considering
  unary component properties and binary contextual component relationships with supervised
  parameter learning is proposed. Finally, text components are grouped into text lines/words
  with a learning-based energy minimization method. Since all the three stages are
  learning-based, there are very few parameters requiring manual tuning. Experimental
  results evaluated on the ICDAR 2005 competition dataset show that our approach yields
  higher precision and recall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
  We also evaluated our approach on a multilingual image dataset with promising results.
