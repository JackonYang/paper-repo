paperAbstract: Text in an image provides vital information for interpreting its contents,
  and text in a scene can aid a variety of tasks from navigation to obstacle avoidance
  and odometry. Despite its value, however, detecting general text in images remains
  a challenging research problem. Motivated by the need to consider the widely varying
  forms of natural text, we propose a bottom-up approach to the problem, which reflects
  the characterness of an image region. In this sense, our approach mirrors the move
  from saliency detection methods to measures of objectness. In order to measure the
  characterness, we develop three novel cues that are tailored for character detection
  and a Bayesian method for their integration. Because text is made up of sets of
  characters, we then design a Markov random field model so as to exploit the inherent
  dependencies between characters. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our characterness cues as well as the advantage of Bayesian multicue integration.
  The proposed text detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark
  scene text detection data sets. We also show that our measurement of characterness
  is superior than state-of-the-art saliency detection models when applied to the
  same task.
