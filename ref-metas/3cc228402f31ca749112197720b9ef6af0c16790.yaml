paperAbstract: This paper describes a system for extracting typed dependency parses
  of English sentences from phrase structure parses. In order to capture inherent
  relations occurring in corpus texts that can be critical in real-world applications,
  many NP relations are included in the set of grammatical relations used. We provide
  a comparison of our system with Minipar and the Link parser. The typed dependency
  extraction facility described here is integrated in the Stanford Parser, available
  for download.
