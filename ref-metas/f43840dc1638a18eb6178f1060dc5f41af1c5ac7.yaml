paperAbstract: 'Support Vector Machines are used for time series prediction and compared
  to radial basis function networks. We make use of two different cost functions for
  Support Vectors: training with (i) an e insensitive loss and (ii) Huber''s robust
  loss function and discuss how to choose the regularization parameters in these models.
  Two applications are considered: data from (a) a noisy (normal and uniform noise)
  Mackey Glass equation and (b) the Santa Fe competition (set D). In both cases Support
  Vector Machines show an excellent performance. In case (b) the Support Vector approach
  improves the best known result on the benchmark by a factor of 29%.'
