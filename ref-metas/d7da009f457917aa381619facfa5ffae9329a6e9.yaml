paperAbstract: Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive.
  Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not
  be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that
  is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human
  evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as
  an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when
  there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.
