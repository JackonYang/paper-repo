paperAbstract: 'We introduce the term cosegmentation which denotes the task of segmenting
  simultaneously the common parts of an image pair. A generative model for cosegmentation
  is presented. Inference in the model leads to minimizing an energy with an MRF term
  encoding spatial coherency and a global constraint which attempts to match the appearance
  histograms of the common parts. This energy has not been proposed previously and
  its optimization is challenging and NP-hard. For this problem a novel optimization
  scheme which we call trust region graph cuts is presented. We demonstrate that this
  framework has the potential to improve a wide range of research: Object driven image
  retrieval, video tracking and segmentation, and interactive image editing. The power
  of the framework lies in its generality, the common part can be a rigid/non-rigid
  object (or scene), observed from different viewpoints or even similar objects of
  the same class.'
