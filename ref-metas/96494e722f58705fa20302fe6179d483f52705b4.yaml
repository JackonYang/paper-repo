paperAbstract: Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences
  of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example,
  an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural
  networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such
  tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing
  to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far
  been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented
  sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech
  corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.
