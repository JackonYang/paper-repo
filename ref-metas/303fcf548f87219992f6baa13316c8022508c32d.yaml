paperAbstract: The aim of this paper is to apply the method of pseudo-Boolean programming
  to the determination of the minimal cut and of the value of the maximal flow through
  a network without, or with, given lower bounds on the arc flows, as well as to the
  solution of some feasibility problems in networks.
