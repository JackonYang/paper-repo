paperAbstract: The use of hidden Markov models for speech recognition has become predominant
  in the last several years, as evidenced by the number of published papers and talks
  at major speech conferences. The reasons this method has become so popular are the
  inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework; the ease and availability
  of training algorithms for cstimating the parameters of the models from finite training
  sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which
  one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular
  words, sounds, and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition
  system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in
  this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of
  theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance
  and their effect on performance for different system implementations.
