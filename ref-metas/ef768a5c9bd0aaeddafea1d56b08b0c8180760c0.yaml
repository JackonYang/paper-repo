paperAbstract: The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition
  and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition
  problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance
  of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties,
  pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance
  are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination
  vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed
  that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large
  set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image
  set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in
  which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the
  recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based
  on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold
  determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted
  using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition
  and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of
  sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions
  and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance
  representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition
  results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time
  recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The
  paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning
  and recognition methodology.
