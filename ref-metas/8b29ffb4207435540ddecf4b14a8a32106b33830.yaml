paperAbstract: We propose a method to make a relationship between images and words.
  We adopt two processes in the method, one is a process to uniformly divide each
  image into sub-images with key words, and the other is a process to carry out vector
  quantization of the sub-images. These processes lead to results which show that
  each sub-image can be correlated to a set of words each of which is selected from
  words assigned to whole images. Original aspects of the method are, (1) all words
  assigned to a whole image are inherited to each divided sub-image, (2) the voting
  probability of each word for a set of divided images is estimated by the result
  of a vector quantization of the feature vector of sub-images. Some experiments show
  the e ectiveness of the proposed method.
