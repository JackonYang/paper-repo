paperAbstract: An original approach is presented for the localisation of objects in
  an image which approach is neuronal and has two steps. In the first step, a rough
  localisation is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural
  net which is able to indicate whether this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image
  of the search object. This first filter does not discriminate for position. From
  its result, areas which might contain an image of the object can be selected. In
  the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine
  the exact position of the object in each area. This algorithm is applied to the
  problem of localising faces in images.
