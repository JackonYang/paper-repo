paperAbstract: Categorization of text images into content oriented classes would be
  a useful capability in a variety of document handling systems Many methods can be
  used to cat egorize texts once their words are known but OCR can garble a large
  proportion of words particularly when low quality images are used Despite this we
  show for one data set that fax quality images can be cat egorized with nearly the
  same accuracy as the original text Further the categoriza tion system can be trained
  on noisy OCR output without need for the true text of any image or for editing of
  OCR output The use of a vector space classi er and train ing method robust to large
  feature sets com bined with discarding of low frequency OCR output strings are the
  key to our approach
