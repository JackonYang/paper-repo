paperAbstract: This paper examines the use of inductive learning to categorize natural
  language documents into predeened content categories. Categorization of text is
  of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing
  systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning
  and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the
  performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on
  the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on
  two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable
  performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives.
  The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective
  in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even
  this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results
  found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the
  impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions.
