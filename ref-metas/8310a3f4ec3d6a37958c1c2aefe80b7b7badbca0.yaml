paperAbstract: "Abstract In recent years there is much interest in word co-occurrence\
  \ relations, such as n-grams, verb\u2013object combinations, or co-occurrence within\
  \ a limited context. This paper discusses how to estimate the likelihood of co-occurrences\
  \ that do not occur in the training data. We present a method that makes local analogies\
  \ between each specific unobserved co-occurrence and other co-occurrences that contain\
  \ similar words. These analogies are based on the assumption that similar word co-occurrences\
  \ have similar values of mutual information. Accordingly, the word similarity metric\
  \ captures similarities between vectors of mutual information values. Our evaluation\
  \ suggests that this method performs better than existing, frequency-based, smoothing\
  \ methods, and may provide an alternative to class-based models. A background survey\
  \ is included, covering issues of lexical co-occurrence, data sparseness and smoothing,\
  \ word similarity and clustering, and mutual information."
