paperAbstract: Grouping images into (semantically) meaningful categories using low-level
  visual features is a challenging and important problem in content-based image retrieval.
  Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high-level concepts from
  low-level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to
  one of the classes. Specifically, we consider the hierarchical classification of
  vacation images; at the highest level, images are classified as indoor or outdoor;
  outdoor images are further classified as city or landscape; finally, a subset of
  landscape images is classified into sunset, forest, and mountain classes. We demonstrate
  that a small vector quantizer (whose optimal size is selected using a modified MDL
  criterion) can be used to model the class-conditional densities of the features,
  required by the Bayesian methodology. The classifiers have been designed and evaluated
  on a database of 6931 vacation photographs. Our system achieved a classification
  accuracy of 90.5% for indoor/outdoor, 95.3% for city/landscape, 96.6% for sunset/forest
  and mountain, and 96% for forest/mountain classification problems. We further develop
  a learning method to incrementally train the classifiers as additional data become
  available. We also show preliminary results for feature reduction using clustering
  techniques. Our goal is to combine multiple two-class classifiers into a single
  hierarchical classifier.
