paperAbstract: We present a distribution model for binary vectors, called the influence
  combination model and show how this model can be used as the basis for unsupervised
  learning algorithms for feature selection. The model can be represented by a particular
  type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination
  machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky.
  In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation
  scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated
  by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted
  as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination
  machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the
  combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis.
  In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination
  model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent
  heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model.
  Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute
  than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning
  algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights
  one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation.
  In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods
  on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images.
