paperAbstract: "We describe a system that can track a hand in a sequence of video\
  \ frames and recognize hand gestures in a user-independent manner. The system locates\
  \ the hand in each video frame and determines if the hand is open or closed. The\
  \ tracking system is able to track the hand to within \xB110 pixels of its correct\
  \ location in 99.7% of the frames from a test set containing video sequences from\
  \ 18 different individuals captured in 18 different room environments. The gesture\
  \ recognition network correctly determines if the hand being tracked is open or\
  \ closed in 99.1% of the frames in this test set. The system has been designed to\
  \ operate in real time with existing hardware."
