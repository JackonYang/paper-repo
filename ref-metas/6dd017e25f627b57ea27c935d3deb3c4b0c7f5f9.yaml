paperAbstract: We present the outcome of the latest edition of the CROHME competition,
  dedicated to on-line handwritten mathematical expression recognition. In addition
  to the standard full expression recognition task from previous competitions, CROHME
  2014 features two new tasks. The first is dedicated to isolated symbol recognition
  including a reject option for invalid symbol hypotheses, and the second concerns
  recognizing expressions that contain matrices. System performance is improving relative
  to previous competitions. Data and evaluation tools used for the competition are
  publicly available.
