paperAbstract: Although the internet offers a wide-spread platform for information
  interchange, day-to-day work in large companies still means the processing of tens
  of thousands of printed documents every day. This paper presents the system smartFIX
  which is a document analysis and understanding system developed by the DFKI spin-off
  INSIDERS. It permits the processing of documents ranging from fixed format forms
  to unstructured letters of any format. Apart from the architecture, the main components
  and system characteristics, we also show some results when applying smartFIX to
  medical bills and prescriptions.
