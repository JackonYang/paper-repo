paperAbstract: Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction
  of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number
  of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable
  memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system.
  A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily
  adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce
  a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart
  of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system
  is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties
  include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization,
  error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only
  weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.
