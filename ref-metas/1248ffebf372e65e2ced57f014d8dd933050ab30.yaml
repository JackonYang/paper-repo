paperAbstract: 'The document image processes used in a recently developed text reading
  system are described. The system consists of three major components: document analysis,
  document understanding, and character segmentation/recognition. The document analysis
  component extracts lines of text from a page for recognition. The document understanding
  component extracts logical relationships between the document constituents. The
  character segmentation/recognition component extracts characters from a text line
  and recognizes them. Experiments on more than a hundred documents have proved that
  the proposed approaches to document analysis and document understanding are robust
  even for multicolumned and multiarticle documents containing graphics and photographs,
  and that the proposed character segmentation/recognition method is robust enough
  to cope with omnifont characters which frequently touch each other. >'
