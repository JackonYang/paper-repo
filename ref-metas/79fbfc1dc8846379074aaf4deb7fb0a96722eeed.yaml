paperAbstract: 'We describe an extension of Earley''s parser for stochastic context-free
  grammars that computes the following quantities given a stochastic context-free
  grammar and an input string: a) probabilities of successive prefixes being generated
  by the grammar; b) probabilities of substrings being generated by the nonterminals,
  including the entire string being generated by the grammar; c) most likely (Viterbi)
  parse of the string; d) posterior expected number of applications of each grammar
  production, as required for reestimating rule probabilities. Probabilities (a) and
  (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input. Our
  algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in
  that it works efficiently on sparse grammars by making use of Earley''s top-down
  control structure. It can process any context-free rule format without conversion
  to some normal form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm.
  Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed
  inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs.'
