paperAbstract: The ability to cheaply train text classifiers is critical to their
  use in information retrieval, content analysis, natural language processing, and
  other tasks involving data which is partly or fully textual. An algorithm for sequential
  sampling during machine learning of statistical classifiers was developed and tested
  on a newswire text categorization task. This method, which we call uncertainty sampling,
  reduced by as much as 500-fold the amount of training data that would have to be
  manually classified to achieve a given level of effectiveness.
