paperAbstract: In this paper we describe a new technique for general purpose interactive
  segmentation of N-dimensional images. The user marks certain pixels as "object"
  or "background" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints
  incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the
  globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution
  gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations
  satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and
  both "object" and "background" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some
  experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical
  image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation
  of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm.
