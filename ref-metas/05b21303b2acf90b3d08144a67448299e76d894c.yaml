paperAbstract: After we developed a model free table recognition system we had the
  desire to automatically register the effect of minor changes to parameters upon
  the overall performance quality of our system in order to tune parameters. Therefore
  we developed a complete benchmarking environment, containing a user front-end to
  acquire ground truth data as well as mechanisms to evaluate the quality of the recognition
  results. The tasks involved in the analysis systems were the locating of table regions,
  identification of cells and mapping of cells to rows and columns. This paper presents
  our approach towards the comparison of recognition results with the ground truth.
  The established definitions of recall and precision did not meet our requirements,
  as we wanted to register even smallest improvements (or changes in general) in the
  results, even when both results were imperfect. We therefore extended the measures
  recall and precision in order to deal with recognition probabilities of objects
  rather than just with Boolean values.
