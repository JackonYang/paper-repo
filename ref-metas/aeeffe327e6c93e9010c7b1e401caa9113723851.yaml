paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of segmenting an image into regions.
  We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions
  using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation
  algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy
  decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the
  algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods
  in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic
  images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and
  is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability
  to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability
  regions.
