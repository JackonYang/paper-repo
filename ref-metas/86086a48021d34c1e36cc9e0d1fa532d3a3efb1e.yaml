paperAbstract: An approach that uses a volume model consisting of cylinders for model-based
  recognition of pedestrians in real-world images is presented. The human body is
  represented by a volume model, and medical motion data are used for simulating the
  movement of walking. This knowledge is exploited to determine the 3-D position,
  as well as the posture of an observed person. By applying a Kalman filter, the model
  parameters in consecutive images are incrementally estimated. The approach is tested
  on real image data.<<ETX>>
