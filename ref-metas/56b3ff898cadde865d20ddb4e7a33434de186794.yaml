paperAbstract: "Scene parsing consists in labeling each pixel in an image with the\
  \ category of the object it belongs to. We propose a method that uses a multiscale\
  \ convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors\
  \ that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates\
  \ the need for engineered features. In parallel to feature extraction, a tree of\
  \ segments is computed from a graph of pixel dissimilarities. The feature vectors\
  \ associated with the segments covered by each node in the tree are aggregated and\
  \ fed to a classifier which produces an estimate of the distribution of object categories\
  \ contained in the segment. A subset of tree nodes that cover the image are then\
  \ selected so as to maximize the average \"purity\" of the class distributions,\
  \ hence maximizing the overall likelihood that each segment will contain a single\
  \ object. The system yields record accuracies on the the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes)\
  \ and the Barcelona Dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on the Stanford\
  \ Background Dataset (8 classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than\
  \ competing approaches, producing a 320 \xD7 240 image labeling in less than 1 second,\
  \ including feature extraction."
