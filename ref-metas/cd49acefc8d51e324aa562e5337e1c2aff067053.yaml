paperAbstract: As a promising area in machine learning, multi-task learning (MTL)
  aims to improve the performance of multiple related learning tasks by leveraging
  useful information among them. In this paper, we give an overview of MTL by first
  giving a definition of MTL. Then several different settings of MTL are introduced,
  including multi-task supervised learning, multi-task unsupervised learning, multi-task
  semi-supervised learning, multi-task active learning, multi-task reinforcement learning,
  multi-task online learning and multi-task multi-view learning. For each setting,
  representative MTL models are presented. In order to speed up the learning process,
  parallel and distributed MTL models are introduced. Many areas, including computer
  vision, bioinformatics, health informatics, speech, natural language processing,
  web applications and ubiquitous computing, use MTL to improve the performance of
  the applications involved and some representative works are reviewed. Finally, recent
  theoretical analyses for MTL are presented.
