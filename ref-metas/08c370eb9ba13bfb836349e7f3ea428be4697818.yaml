paperAbstract: Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of many
  variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions factor as a product
  of "local" functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a
  factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph,
  In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product
  algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational
  rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various
  marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms
  developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications
  can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the
  forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative "turbo" decoding
  algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the
  Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.
