paperAbstract: An electrical signal transmission system, applicable to the transmission
  of signals from trackside hot box detector equipment for railroad locomotives and
  rolling stock, wherein a basic pulse train is transmitted whereof the pulses are
  of a selected first amplitude and represent a train axle count, and a spike pulse
  of greater selected amplitude is transmitted, occurring immediately after the axle
  count pulse to which it relates, whenever an overheated axle box is detected. To
  enable the signal receiving equipment to determine on which side of a train the
  overheated box is located, the spike pulses are of two different amplitudes corresponding,
  respectively, to opposite sides of the train.
