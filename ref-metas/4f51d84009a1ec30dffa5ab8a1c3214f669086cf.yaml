paperAbstract: In this paper, we present Lazy Snapping, an interactive image cutout
  tool. Lazy Snapping separates coarse and fine scale processing, making object specification
  and detailed adjustment easy. Moreover, Lazy Snapping provides instant visual feedback,
  snapping the cutout contour to the true object boundary efficiently despite the
  presence of ambiguous or low contrast edges. Instant feedback is made possible by
  a novel image segmentation algorithm which combines graph cut with pre-computed
  over-segmentation. A set of intuitive user interface (UI) tools is designed and
  implemented to provide flexible control and editing for the users. Usability studies
  indicate that Lazy Snapping provides a better user experience and produces better
  segmentation results than the state-of-the-art interactive image cutout tool, Magnetic
  Lasso in Adobe Photoshop.
