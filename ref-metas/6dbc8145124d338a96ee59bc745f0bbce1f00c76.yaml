paperAbstract: Using generic interpolation machinery based on solving Poisson equations,
  a variety of novel tools are introduced for seamless editing of image regions. The
  first set of tools permits the seamless importation of both opaque and transparent
  source image regions into a destination region. The second set is based on similar
  mathematical ideas and allows the user to modify the appearance of the image seamlessly,
  within a selected region. These changes can be arranged to affect the texture, the
  illumination, and the color of objects lying in the region, or to make tileable
  a rectangular selection.
