paperAbstract: In this paper we present a novel recognition approach that results
  in a 15% decrease in word error rate on heavily degraded Indian language document
  images. OCRs have considerably good performance on good quality documents, but fail
  easily in presence of degradations. Also, classical OCR approaches perform poorly
  over complex scripts such as those for Indian languages. We address these issues
  by proposing to recognize character n-gram images, which are basically groupings
  of consecutive character/component segments. Our approach is unique, since we use
  the character n-grams as a primitive for recognition rather than for post processing.
  By exploiting the additional context present in the character n-gram images, we
  enable better disambiguation between confusing characters in the recognition phase.
  The labels obtained from recognizing the constituent n-grams are then fused to obtain
  a label for the word that emitted them. Our method is inherently robust to degradations
  such as cuts and merges which are common in digital libraries of scanned documents.
  We also present a reliable and scalable scheme for recognizing character n-gram
  images. Tests on English and Malayalam document images show considerable improvement
  in recognition in the case of heavily degraded documents.
