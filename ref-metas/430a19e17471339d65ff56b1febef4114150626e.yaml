paperAbstract: "The recognition of text in everyday scenes is made difficult by viewing\
  \ conditions, unusual fonts, and lack of linguistic context. Most methods integrate\
  \ a priori appearance information and some sort of hard or soft constraint on the\
  \ allowable strings. Weinman and Learned-Miller [14] showed that the similarity\
  \ among characters, as a supplement to the appearance of the characters with respect\
  \ to a model, could be used to improve scene text recognition. In this work, we\
  \ make further improvements to scene text recognition by taking a novel approach\
  \ to the incorporation of similarity. In particular, we train a similarity expert\
  \ that learns to classify each pair of characters as equivalent or not. After removing\
  \ logical inconsistencies in an equivalence graph, we formulate the search for the\
  \ maximum likelihood interpretation of a sign as an integer program. We incorporate\
  \ the equivalence information as constraints in the integer program and build an\
  \ optimization criterion out of appearance features and character bigrams. Finally,\
  \ we take the optimal solution from the integer program, and compare all \u201C\
  nearby\u201D solutions using a probability model for strings derived from search\
  \ engine queries. We demonstrate word error reductions of more than 30% relative\
  \ to previous methods on the same data set."
