paperAbstract: Markov random field models provide a robust and unified framework for
  early vision problems such as stereo and image restoration. Inference algorithms
  based on graph cuts and belief propagation have been found to yield accurate results,
  but despite recent advances are often too slow for practical use. In this paper
  we present some algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time
  of the loopy belief propagation approach. One of the techniques reduces the complexity
  of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible
  labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as image restoration
  that have a large label set. Another technique speeds up and reduces the memory
  requirements of belief propagation on grid graphs. A third technique is a multi-grid
  method that makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of
  message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together
  these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude.
  In practice we obtain results that are as accurate as those of other global methods
  (e.g., using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being nearly as fast as purely
  local methods.
