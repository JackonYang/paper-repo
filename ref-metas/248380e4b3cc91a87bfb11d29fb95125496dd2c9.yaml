paperAbstract: "We describe the results of extensive machine learning experiments\
  \ on large collections of Reuters\u2019 English and German newswires. The goal of\
  \ these experiments was to automatically discover classification patterns that can\
  \ be used for assignment of topics to the individual newswires. Our results with\
  \ the English newswire collection show a very large gain in performance as compared\
  \ to published benchmarks, while our initial results with the German newswires appear\
  \ very promising. We present our methodology, which seems to be insensitive to the\
  \ language of the document collections, and discuss issues related to the differences\
  \ in results that we have obtained for the two collections."
