paperAbstract: Recognizing humans, estimating their pose and segmenting their body
  parts are key to high-level image understanding. Because humans are highly articulated,
  the range of deformations they undergo makes this task extremely challenging. Previous
  methods have focused largely on heuristics or pairwise part models in approaching
  this problem. We propose a bottom-up parsing of increasingly more complete partial
  body masks guided by a parse tree. At each level of the parsing process, we evaluate
  the partial body masks directly via shape matching with exemplars, without regard
  to how the parses are formed. The body is evaluated as a whole, not the sum of its
  constituent parses, unlike previous approaches. Multiple image segmentations are
  included at each of the levels of the parsing, to augment existing parses or to
  introduce ones. Our method yields both a pose estimate as well as a segmentation
  of the human. We demonstrate competitive results on this challenging task with relatively
  few training examples on a dataset of baseball players with wide pose variation.
  Our method is comparatively simple and could be easily extended to other objects.
