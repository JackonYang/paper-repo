paperAbstract: "A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining\
  \ which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents,\
  \ introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. & Jordan, M. I. (2003)\
  \ J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing\
  \ a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a\
  \ topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain\
  \ Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze\
  \ abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number\
  \ of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the\
  \ data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles,\
  \ and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying \u201C\
  hot topics\u201D by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate\
  \ semantic content."
