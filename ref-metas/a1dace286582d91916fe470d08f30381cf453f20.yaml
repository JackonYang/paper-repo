paperAbstract: Valiant (1984) and others have studied the problem of learning various
  classes of Boolean functions from examples. Here we discuss incremental learning
  of these functions. We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each
  example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis,
  if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure
  of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner
  makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that
  make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples
  seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean
  functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions.
  The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage
  of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with
  the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm
  is computationally efficient in both time and space.
