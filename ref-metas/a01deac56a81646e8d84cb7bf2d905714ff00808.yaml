paperAbstract: "Abstract.This paper describes the robust reading competitions for\
  \ ICDAR 2003. With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing\
  \ text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark\
  \ datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use\
  \ the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the\
  \ capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust\
  \ reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and\
  \ also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were\
  \ text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the\
  \ problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the\
  \ art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing\
  \ detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing\
  \ researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.\
  \ The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief\
  \ description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases\
  \ where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for\
  \ combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination\
  \ scheme improves on any of the individual systems."
