paperAbstract: 'Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly
  presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts,
  and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in
  the context of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context
  of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex
  training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore
  curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements
  in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both
  an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and,
  in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained:
  curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general
  strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).'
