paperAbstract: This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis
  of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known as Latent
  Semantic Analysis. In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra
  and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed
  technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture
  decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation
  in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature
  controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting,
  which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic
  Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural
  language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper
  presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections
  and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate
  substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard
  Latent Semantic Analysis.
