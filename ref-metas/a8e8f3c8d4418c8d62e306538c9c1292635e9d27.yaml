paperAbstract: The ability of learning networks to generalize can be greatly enhanced
  by providing constraints from the task domain. This paper demonstrates how such
  constraints can be integrated into a backpropagation network through the architecture
  of the network. This approach has been successfully applied to the recognition of
  handwritten zip code digits provided by the U.S. Postal Service. A single network
  learns the entire recognition operation, going from the normalized image of the
  character to the final classification.
