paperAbstract: "This study examines the hypothesis that the ability of a reader to\
  \ learn from text depends on the match between the background knowledge of the reader\
  \ and the difficulty of the text information. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a\
  \ statistical technique that represents the content of a document as a vector in\
  \ high\u2010dimensional semantic space based on a large text corpus, is used to\
  \ predict how much readers will learn from texts based on the estimated conceptual\
  \ match between their topic knowledge and the text information. Participants completed\
  \ tests to assess their knowledge of the human heart and circulatory system, then\
  \ read one of four texts that ranged in difficulty from elementary to medical school\
  \ level, then completed the tests again. Results show a nonmonotonic relation in\
  \ which learning was greatest for texts that were neither too easy nor too difficult.\
  \ LSA proved as effective at predicting learning from these texts as traditional\
  \ knowledge assessment measures. For these texts, optimal assignment o..."
