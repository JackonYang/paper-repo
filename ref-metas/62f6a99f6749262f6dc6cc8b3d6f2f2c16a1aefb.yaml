paperAbstract: A homogeneous approach for acquisition, storage, and recognition of
  nonparametric shapes from images, using a novel shape representation based on shape
  autocorrelation operators is presented. A theoretical and experimental analysis
  of the computational complexity, recognition performance with increasing database
  size, and fault tolerance of the approach is presented. The system has been tested
  extensively with more than 300 arbitrary shapes in the database. Using a set of
  complex shapes, the recognition behavior with respect to occlusion, geometric transformation,
  and cluttered environments is studied. Unsupervised shape and subpart acquisition
  is demonstrated.<<ETX>>
