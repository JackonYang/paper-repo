paperAbstract: A method for learning, tracking, and recognizing human gestures using
  a view-based approach to model articulated objects is presented. Objects are represented
  using sets of view models, rather than single templates. Stereotypical space-time
  patterns, i.e., gestures, are then matched to stored gesture patterns using dynamic
  time warping. Real-time performance is achieved by using special purpose correlation
  hardware and view prediction to prune as much of the search space as possible. Both
  view models and view predictions are learned from examples. Results showing tracking
  and recognition of human hand gestures at over 10 Hz are presented.<<ETX>>
