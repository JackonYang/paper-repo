paperAbstract: Here we explore a discriminative learning method on underlying generative
  models for the purpose of discriminating between object categories. Visual recognition
  algorithms learn models from a set of training examples. Generative models learn
  their representations by considering data from a single class. Generative models
  are popular in computer vision for many reasons, including their ability to elegantly
  incorporate prior knowledge and to handle correspondences between object parts and
  detected features. However, generative models are often inferior to discriminative
  models during classification tasks. We study a discriminative approach to learning
  object categories which maintains the representational power of generative learning,
  but trains the generative models in a discriminative manner. The discriminatively
  trained models perform better during classification tasks as a result of selecting
  discriminative sets of features. We conclude by proposing a multi-class object recognition
  system which initially trains object classes in a generative manner, identifies
  subsets of similar classes with high confusion, and finally trains models for these
  subsets in a discriminative manner to realize gains in classification performance.
