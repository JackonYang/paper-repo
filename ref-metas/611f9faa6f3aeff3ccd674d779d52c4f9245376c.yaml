paperAbstract: Most current approaches to recognition aim to be scale-invariant. However,
  the cues available for recognizing a 300 pixel tall object are qualitatively different
  from those for recognizing a 3 pixel tall object. We argue that for sensors with
  finite resolution, one should instead use scale-variant, or multiresolution representations
  that adapt in complexity to the size of a putative detection window. We describe
  a multiresolution model that acts as a deformable part-based model when scoring
  large instances and a rigid template with scoring small instances. We also examine
  the interplay of resolution and context, and demonstrate that context is most helpful
  for detecting low-resolution instances when local models are limited in discriminative
  power. We demonstrate impressive results on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark, which
  contains object instances at a wide range of scales. Whereas recent state-of-the-art
  methods demonstrate missed detection rates of 86%-37% at 1 false-positive-per-image,
  our multiresolution model reduces the rate to 29%.
