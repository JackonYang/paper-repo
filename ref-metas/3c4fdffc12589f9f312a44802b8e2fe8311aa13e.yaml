paperAbstract: A new boosting algorithm, called FloatBoost, is proposed to overcome
  the monotonicity problem of the sequential AdaBoost learning. AdaBoost [1, 2] is
  a sequential forward search procedure using the greedy selection strategy. The premise
  oyered by the sequential procedure can be broken-down when the monotonicity assumption,
  i.e. that when adding a new feature to the current set, the value of the performance
  criterion does not decrease, is violated. FloatBoost incorporates the idea of Floating
  Search [3] into AdaBoost to solve the non-monotonicity problem encountered in the
  sequential search of AdaBoost.We then present a system which learns to detect multi-view
  faces using FloatBoost. The system uses a coarse-to-fine, simple-to-complex architecture
  called detector-pyramid. FloatBoost learns the component detectors in the pyramid
  and yields similar or higher classification accuracy than AdaBoost with a smaller
  number of weak classifiers. This work leads to the first real-time multi-view face
  detection system in the world. It runs at 200 ms per image of size 320x240 pixels
  on a Pentium-III CPU of 700 MHz. A live demo will be shown at the conference.
