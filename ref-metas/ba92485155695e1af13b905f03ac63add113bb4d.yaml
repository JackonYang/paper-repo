paperAbstract: Most offline handwriting recognition approaches proceed by segmenting
  words into smaller pieces (usually characters) which are recognized separately.
  The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized
  parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus
  on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition
  approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact
  that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will
  produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow
  us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions
  that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible
  even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach
  to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments
  show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which
  operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents).
