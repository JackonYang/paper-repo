paperAbstract: The metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric
  representation of similarity are questioned on both theoretical and empirical grounds.
  A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented
  as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process.
  Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model,
  which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures
  of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model
  are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The
  model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena
  such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments
  of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects
  of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations
  of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the
  relations of prototypicality and family resemblance
