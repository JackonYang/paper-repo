paperAbstract: 'Considerable advances have been made in learning to recognize and
  localize visual object classes. Simple bag-of-feature approaches label each pixel
  or patch independently. More advanced models attempt to improve the coherence of
  the labellings by introducing some form of inter-patch coupling: traditional spatial
  models such as MRF''s provide crisper local labellings by exploiting neighbourhood-level
  couplings, while aspect models such as PLSA and LDA use global relevance estimates
  (global mixing proportions for the classes appearing in the image) to shape the
  local choices. We point out that the two approaches are complementary, combining
  them to produce aspect-based spatial field models that outperform both approaches.
  We study two spatial models: one based on averaging over forests of minimal spanning
  trees linking neighboring image regions, the other on an efficient chain-based Expectation
  Propagation method for regular 8-neighbor Markov random fields. The models can be
  trained using either patch-level labels or image-level keywords. As input features
  they use factored observation models combining texture, color and position cues.
  Experimental results on the MSR Cambridge data sets show that combining spatial
  and aspect models significantly improves the region-level classification accuracy.
  In fact our models trained with image-level labels outperform PLSA trained with
  pixel-level ones.'
