paperAbstract: 'The authors describe two systems in which neural network classifiers
  are merged with dynamic programming (DP) time alignment methods to produce high-performance
  continuous speech recognizers. One system uses the connectionist Viterbi-training
  (CVT) procedure, in which a neural network with frame-level outputs is trained using
  guidance from a time alignment procedure. The other system uses multi-state time-delay
  neural networks (MS-TDNNs), in which embedded DP time alignment allows network training
  with only word-level external supervision. The CVT results on the, TI Digits are
  99.1% word accuracy and 98.0% string accuracy. The MS-TDNNs are described in detail,
  with attention focused on their architecture, the training procedure, and results
  of applying the MS-TDNNs to continuous speaker-dependent alphabet recognition: on
  two speakers, word accuracy is respectively 97.5% and 89.7%.<<ETX>>'
