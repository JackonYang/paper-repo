paperAbstract: "G. Wyszecki and W. S. Stiles London: John Wiley. 1967. Pp. xiv + 628.\
  \ Price \xA311. This remarkable and unusual book is by two outstanding authorities\
  \ on the science of colour: Dr. Stiles, for many years a senior member of the Light\
  \ Division at the National Physical Laboratory, and Dr. Wyszecki, currently in charge\
  \ of the Radiation Optics Section of the Canadian National Research Council. The\
  \ authors' aim has been to provide a comprehensive source book of data required\
  \ by the practical and theoretical worker in the field of colour and they have achieved\
  \ this aim so successfully that their book is likely to become the standard work\
  \ on the subject and to remain so for a good many years."
