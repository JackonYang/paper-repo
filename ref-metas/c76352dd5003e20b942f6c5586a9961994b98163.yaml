paperAbstract: 'This report presents the final results of the ICDAR 2017 Robust Reading
  Challenge on COCO-Text. A challenge on scene text detection and recognition based
  on the largest real scene text dataset currently available: the COCO-Text dataset.
  The competition is structured around three tasks: Text Localization, Cropped Word
  Recognition and End-To-End Recognition. The competition received a total of 27 submissions
  over the different opened tasks. This report describes the datasets and the ground
  truth, details the performance evaluation protocols used and presents the final
  results along with a brief summary of the participating methods.'
