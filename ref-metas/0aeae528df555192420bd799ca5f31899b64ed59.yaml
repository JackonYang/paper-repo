paperAbstract: 'The recent COCO object detection dataset presents several new challenges
  for object detection. In particular, it contains objects at a broad range of scales,
  less prototypical images, and requires more precise localization. To address these
  challenges, we test three modifications to the standard Fast R-CNN object detector:
  (1) skip connections that give the detector access to features at multiple network
  layers, (2) a foveal structure to exploit object context at multiple object resolutions,
  and (3) an integral loss function and corresponding network adjustment that improve
  localization. The result of these modifications is that information can flow along
  multiple paths in our network, including through features from multiple network
  layers and from multiple object views. We refer to our modified classifier as a
  "MultiPath" network. We couple our MultiPath network with DeepMask object proposals,
  which are well suited for localization and small objects, and adapt our pipeline
  to predict segmentation masks in addition to bounding boxes. The combined system
  improves results over the baseline Fast R-CNN detector with Selective Search by
  66% overall and by 4x on small objects. It placed second in both the COCO 2015 detection
  and segmentation challenges.'
