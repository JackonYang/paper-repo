paperAbstract: Algorithm for table image segmentation, a part of complete document
  recognition system is presented. The proposed approach introduces a concept of table
  grid which can serve for advanced methods of table structure analysis. It provides
  a layer of terminal symbols for the table, which is used by syntactical methods.
  Detailed discussion of grid detection is presented which is performed through the
  analysis of connected components projection profile. Simple rules for analysis of
  table structure cover majority of real life tables. The system is implemented, rested,
  and is now extensively used in FineReader OCR product.
