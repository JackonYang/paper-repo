paperAbstract: A versatile assembly system, using TV cameras and oomputer-controlled
  arm and moving table, is described. It makes almple assemblies such aa a peg and
  rings and a toy car. It separates parts from a heap, recognising them with an overhead
  camera, then assembles them by feel. It can be instructed to perform a new task
  with different parte by spending an hour showing it the parts and a day or two programming
  the assembly manipulations. A hierarchical description of parts, views, outlines
  etc. is used to construct models, and a structure matching algorithm is used in
  recognition.
