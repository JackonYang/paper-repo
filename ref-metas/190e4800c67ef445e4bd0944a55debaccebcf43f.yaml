paperAbstract: 'The curse of dimensionality is severe when modeling high-dimensional
  discrete data: the number of possible combinations of the variables explodes exponentially.
  In this paper we propose a new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that
  requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow only at most as the square
  of the number of variables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the
  joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions.
  The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random
  variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden
  units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency
  tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling the distribution of several
  discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods
  such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, and show that significant
  improvements can be obtained by pruning the network.'
