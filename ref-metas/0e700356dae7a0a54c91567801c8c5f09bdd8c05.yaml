paperAbstract: We present a human-centric paradigm for scene understanding. Our approach
  goes beyond estimating 3D scene geometry and predicts the "workspace" of a human
  which is represented by a data-driven vocabulary of human interactions. Our method
  builds upon the recent work in indoor scene understanding and the availability of
  motion capture data to create a joint space of human poses and scene geometry by
  modeling the physical interactions between the two. This joint space can then be
  used to predict potential human poses and joint locations from a single image. In
  a way, this work revisits the principle of Gibsonian affor-dances, reinterpreting
  it for the modern, data-driven era.
