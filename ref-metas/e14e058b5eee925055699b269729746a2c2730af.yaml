paperAbstract: Describes a method for classifying document images on the basis of
  their physical layout. The layout is described by means of a hierarchical description,
  the modified X-Y tree, that is derived from the classical X-Y tree segmentation
  algorithm taking into account cuts along lines in addition to cuts along white spaces
  between blocks. In order to reduce problems due to noise and the skew of the input
  image, the modified X-Y tree is built on top of regions extracted by a commercial
  OCR package. The tree is afterwards coded into a fixed-size representation that
  takes into account occurrences of tree patterns in the tree representing the page.
  Lastly, this feature vector is fed to an artificial neural network that is trained
  to classify document images. The system is applied to the classification of documents
  belonging to digital libraries. Examples of classes taken into account are "title
  page", "index" and "regular page". Many tests have been carried out on a data set
  of more than 600 pages from an online digital library. These tests allowed us to
  conclude that the use of modified X-Y trees is advantageous with respect to the
  classical X-Y decomposition for this classification task.
