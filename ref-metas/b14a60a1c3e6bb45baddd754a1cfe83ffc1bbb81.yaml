paperAbstract: Deep Learning has had a transformative impact on Computer Vision, but
  for all of the success there is also a significant cost. This is that the models
  and procedures used are so complex and intertwined that it is often impossible to
  distinguish the impact of the individual design and engineering choices each model
  embodies. This ambiguity diverts progress in the field, and leads to a situation
  where developing a state-of-the-art model is as much an art as a science. As a step
  towards addressing this problem we present a massive exploration of the effects
  of the myriad architectural and hyperparameter choices that must be made in generating
  a state-of-the-art model. The model is of particular interest because it won the
  2017 Visual Question Answering Challenge. We provide a detailed analysis of the
  impact of each choice on model performance, in the hope that it will inform others
  in developing models, but also that it might set a precedent that will accelerate
  scientific progress in the field.
