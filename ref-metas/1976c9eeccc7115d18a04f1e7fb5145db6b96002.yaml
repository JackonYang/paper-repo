paperAbstract: Freebase is a practical, scalable tuple database used to structure
  general human knowledge. The data in Freebase is collaboratively created, structured,
  and maintained. Freebase currently contains more than 125,000,000 tuples, more than
  4000 types, and more than 7000 properties. Public read/write access to Freebase
  is allowed through an HTTP-based graph-query API using the Metaweb Query Language
  (MQL) as a data query and manipulation language. MQL provides an easy-to-use object-oriented
  interface to the tuple data in Freebase and is designed to facilitate the creation
  of collaborative, Web-based data-oriented applications.
