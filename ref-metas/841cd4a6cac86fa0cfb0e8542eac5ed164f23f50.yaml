paperAbstract: 'By examining the experimental data on the statistical properties of
  natural scenes together with (retinal) contrast sensitivity data, we arrive at a
  first principle, theoretical hypothesis for the purpose of retinal processing and
  its relationship to an animal''s environment. We argue that the retinal goal is
  to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent
  basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex,
  as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however,
  by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the
  retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict
  an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high
  frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate
  a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family
  is compared to psychophysical data.'
