paperAbstract: "The topic of semantic segmentation has witnessed considerable progress\
  \ due to the powerful features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [13].\
  \ The current leading approaches for semantic segmentation exploit shape information\
  \ by extracting CNN features from masked image regions. This strategy introduces\
  \ artificial boundaries on the images and may impact the quality of the extracted\
  \ features. Besides, the operations on the raw image domain require to compute thousands\
  \ of networks on a single image, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose\
  \ to exploit shape information via masking convolutional features. The proposal\
  \ segments (e.g., super-pixels) are treated as masks on the convolutional feature\
  \ maps. The CNN features of segments are directly masked out from these maps and\
  \ used to train classifiers for recognition. We further propose a joint method to\
  \ handle objects and \u201Cstuff\u201D (e.g., grass, sky, water) in the same framework.\
  \ State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on benchmarks of PASCAL VOC and new\
  \ PASCAL-CONTEXT, with a compelling computational speed."
