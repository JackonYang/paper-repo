paperAbstract: "Most probabilistic retrieval models incorporate information about\
  \ the occurrence of index terms in relevant and non\u2010relevant documents. In\
  \ this paper we consider the situation where no relevance information is available,\
  \ that is, at the start of the search. Based on a probabilistic model, strategies\
  \ are proposed for the initial search and an intermediate search. Retrieval experiments\
  \ with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search\
  \ strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval\
  \ effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents.\
  \ The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback\
  \ search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high\
  \ rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative\
  \ strategy."
