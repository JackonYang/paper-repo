paperAbstract: 'Image-text matching tasks

  have recently attracted a lot of attention in the computer vision field. The

  key point of this cross-domain problem is how to accurately measure the

  similarity between the visual and the textual contents, which demands a fine

  understanding of both modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel position

  focused attention network (PFAN) to investigate the relation between the visual

  and the textual views. In this work, we integrate the object position clue to

  enhance the visual-text joint-embedding learning. We first split the images into
  blocks, by which we

  infer the relative position of region in the image. Then, an attention

  mechanism is proposed to model the relations between the image region and

  blocks and generate the valuable position feature, which will be further

  utilized to enhance the region expression and model a more reliable

  relationship between the visual image and the textual sentence. Experiments

  on the popular datasets Flickr30K and MS-COCO show the effectiveness of the

  proposed method. Besides the public datasets, we also conduct experiments on

  our collected practical news dataset (Tencent-News) to validate the practical

  application value of proposed method. As far as we know, this is the first

  attempt to test the performance on the practical application. Our method can achieve

  the state-of-art performance on all of these three datasets.'
