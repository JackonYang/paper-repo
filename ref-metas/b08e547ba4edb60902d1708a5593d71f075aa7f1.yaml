paperAbstract: The development and implementation of an algorithm for automated text
  string separation that is relatively independent of changes in text font style and
  size and of string orientation are described. It is intended for use in an automated
  system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation
  of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group
  components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics.
  The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics.
  These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics
  recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness
  and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed
  superior performance compared to other techniques. >
