paperAbstract: The ScanTab system represents a knowledge-based approach to table recognition
  in scanned documents. In contrast to most systems which recognize tables by grouping
  layout information, our system uses predefined information about which table types
  may appear. This enables a very accurate detection able to cope with distorted tables
  and tables providing little layout information, e.g., no lines, bad alignment, or
  few rows. Table recognition starts with the detection of the table header. Afterwards,
  this header is compared with table headers of known reference tables. Having determined
  the correct reference table, the information kept in the knowledge base is utilized
  to compute the complete table structure. A graphical user interface allows an easy
  and fast specification of reference tables.
