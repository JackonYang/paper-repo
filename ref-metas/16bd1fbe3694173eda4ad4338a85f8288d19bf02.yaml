paperAbstract: Information extraction is a form of shallow text processing that locates
  a specified set of relevant items in a natural-language document. Systems for this
  task require significant domain-specific knowledge and are time-consuming and difficult
  to build by hand, making them a good application for machine learning. We present
  a system, RAPIER, that uses pairs of sample documents and filled templates to induce
  pattern-match rules that directly extract fillers for the slots in the template.
  RAPIER employs a bottom-up learning algorithm which incorporates techniques from
  several inductive logic programming systems and acquires unbounded patterns that
  include constraints on the words, part-of-speech tags, and semantic classes present
  in the filler and the surrounding text. We present encouraging experimental results
  on two domains.
