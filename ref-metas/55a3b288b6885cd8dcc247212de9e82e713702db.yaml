paperAbstract: This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich
  information into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and mixture
  of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm,
  we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing
  Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward
  pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms
  and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm
  (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from
  the recent works that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required
  for each training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance
  by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise
  terms, making many existing works as its special cases. Third, DPN makes MF easier
  to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly
  evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new
  state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy of 77.5%.
