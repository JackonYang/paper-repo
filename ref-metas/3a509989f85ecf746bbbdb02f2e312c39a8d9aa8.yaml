paperAbstract: We propose a system that finds text in natural scenes using a variety
  of cues. Our novel data-driven method incorporates coarse-to-fine detection of character
  pixels using convolutional features (Text-Conv), followed by extracting connected
  components (CCs) from characters using edge and color features, and finally performing
  a graph-based segmentation of CCs into words (Word-Graph). For Text-Conv, the initial
  detection is based on convolutional feature maps similar to those used in Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs), but learned using Convolutional k-means. Convolution masks
  defined by local and neighboring patch features are used to improve detection accuracy.
  The Word-Graph algorithm uses contextual information to both improve word segmentation
  and prune false character/word detections. Different definitions for foreground
  (text) regions are used to train the detection stages, some based on bounding box
  intersection, and others on bounding box and pixel intersection. Our system obtains
  pixel, character, and word detection f-measures of 93.14%, 90.26%, and 86.77% respectively
  for the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Focused Scene Text dataset, out-performing state-of-the-art
  systems. This approach may work for other detection targets with homogenous color
  in natural scenes.
