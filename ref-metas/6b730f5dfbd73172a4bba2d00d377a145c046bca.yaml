paperAbstract: The automatic discovery of distinctive parts for an object or scene
  class is challenging since it requires simultaneously to learn the part appearance
  and also to identify the part occurrences in images. In this paper, we propose a
  simple, efficient, and effective method to do so. We address this problem by learning
  parts incrementally, starting from a single part occurrence with an Exemplar SVM.
  In this manner, additional part instances are discovered and aligned reliably before
  being considered as training examples. We also propose entropy-rank curves as a
  means of evaluating the distinctiveness of parts shareable between categories and
  use them to select useful parts out of a set of candidates. We apply the new representation
  to the task of scene categorisation on the MIT Scene 67 benchmark. We show that
  our method can learn parts which are significantly more informative and for a fraction
  of the cost, compared to previous part-learning methods such as Singh et al. [28].
  We also show that a well constructed bag of words or Fisher vector model can substantially
  outperform the previous state-of-the-art classification performance on this data.
