paperAbstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of semantic equivalence
  between two texts. This paper presents the results of the STS pilot task in Semeval.
  The training data contained 2000 sentence pairs from previously existing paraphrase
  datasets and machine translation evaluation resources. The test data also comprised
  2000 sentences pairs for those datasets, plus two surprise datasets with 400 pairs
  from a different machine translation evaluation corpus and 750 pairs from a lexical
  resource mapping exercise. The similarity of pairs of sentences was rated on a 0-5
  scale (low to high similarity) by human judges using Amazon Mechanical Turk, with
  high Pearson correlation scores, around 90%. 35 teams participated in the task,
  submitting 88 runs. The best results scored a Pearson correlation >80%, well above
  a simple lexical baseline that only scored a 31% correlation. This pilot task opens
  an exciting way ahead, although there are still open issues, specially the evaluation
  metric.
