paperAbstract: We investigate the problem of training a support vector machine (SVM)
  on a very large database in the case in which the number of support vectors is also
  very large. Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic
  programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points.
  This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points
  exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers,
  the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact
  that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing
  algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper
  we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem
  and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In
  order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange
  rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support
  vectors.
