paperAbstract: "Recent developments in video-tracking allow the outlines of moving,\
  \ natural objects in a video-camera input stream to be tracked live, at full video-rate.\
  \ Previous systems have been available to do this for specially illuminated objects\
  \ or for naturally illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able\
  \ to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following\
  \ only centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system described\
  \ here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects\
  \ at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit, and without any\
  \ special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore.\
  \ The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines\
  \ curve representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility\
  \ can be used to turn parts of the body\u2014for instance, hands and lips\u2014\
  into input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a 3D mouse with non-rigid\
  \ gestures signalling a button press or the \u201Clifting\u201D of the mouse. Both\
  \ rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked independently and used as inputs,\
  \ for example to animate a computer-generated face."
