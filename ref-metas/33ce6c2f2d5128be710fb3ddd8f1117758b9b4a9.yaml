paperAbstract: A motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern in x-y-t space;
  a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in this space.
  Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal
  energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first
  stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial
  frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed
  to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent
  stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology
  and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion
  phenomena.
