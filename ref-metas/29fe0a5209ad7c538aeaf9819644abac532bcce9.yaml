paperAbstract: We present two methods using mixtures of linear sub-spaces for face
  detection in gray level images. One method uses a mixture of factor analyzers to
  concurrently perform clustering and, within each cluster, perform local dimensionality
  reduction. The parameters of the mixture model are estimated using an EM algorithm.
  A face is detected if the probability of an input sample is above a predefined threshold.
  The other mixture of subspaces method uses Kohonen's self-organizing map for clustering
  and Fisher linear discriminant to find the optimal projection for pattern classification,
  and a Gaussian distribution to model the class-conditioned density function of the
  projected samples for each class. The parameters of the class-conditioned density
  functions are maximum likelihood estimates and the decision rule is also based on
  maximum likelihood. A wide range of face images including ones in different poses,
  with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as the
  training set to capture the variations of human faces. Our methods have been tested
  on three sets of 225 images which contain 871 faces. Experimental results on the
  first two datasets show that our methods perform as well as the best methods in
  the literature, yet have fewer false detects.
