paperAbstract: "Following verbal route instructions requires knowledge of language,\
  \ space, action and perception. We present MARCO, an agent that follows free-form,\
  \ natural language route instructions by representing and executing a sequence of\
  \ compound action specifications that model which actions to take under which conditions.\
  \ MARCO infers implicit actions from knowledge of both linguistic conditional phrases\
  \ and from spatial action and local configurations. Thus, MARCO performs explicit\
  \ actions, implicit actions necessary to achieve the stated conditions, and exploratory\
  \ actions to learn about the world. \n \nWe gathered a corpus of 786 route instructions\
  \ from six people in three large-scale virtual indoor environments. Thirtysix other\
  \ people followed these instructions and rated them for quality. These human participants\
  \ finished at the intended destination on 69% of the trials. MARCO followed the\
  \ same instructions in the same environments, with a success rate of 61%. We measured\
  \ the efficacy of action inference with MARCO variants lacking action inference:\
  \ executing only explicit actions, MARCO succeeded on just 28% of the trials. For\
  \ this task, inferring implicit actions is essential to follow poor instructions,\
  \ but is also crucial for many highly-rated route instructions."
