paperAbstract: 'One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods
  that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an
  intelligent dialogue agent. To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for
  the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question
  answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is
  able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many
  more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be
  capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can
  currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill
  sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their
  systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model,
  and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks.'
