paperAbstract: Type-logical semantics studies linguistic meaning with the help of
  the theory of types. The latter originated with Russell as an answer to the paradoxes,
  but has the additional virtue that it is very close to ordinary language. In fact,
  type theory is so much more similar to language than predicate logic is, that adopting
  it as a vehicle of representation can overcome the mismatches between grammatical
  form and predicate logical form that were observed by Frege and Russell. The grammatical
  forms of ordinary language sentences consequently may be taken to be much less misleading
  than logicians in the first half of the 20th century often thought them to be. This
  was realized by Richard Montague, who used the theory of types to translate fragments
  of ordinary language into a logical language. Semantics is commonly divided into
  lexical semantics, which studies the meaning of words, and compositional semantics,
  which studies the way in which complex phrases obtain a meaning from their constituents.
  The strength of type-logical semantics lies with the latter, but type-logical theories
  can be combined with many competing hypotheses about lexical meaning, provided these
  hypotheses are expressed using the language of type theory.
