paperAbstract: Disclosed is an improved articulated bar flail having shearing edges
  for efficiently shredding materials. An improved shredder cylinder is disclosed
  with a plurality of these flails circumferentially spaced and pivotally attached
  to the periphery of a rotatable shaft. Also disclosed is an improved shredder apparatus
  which has a pair of these shredder cylinders mounted to rotate about spaced parallel
  axes which cooperates with a conveyer apparatus which has a pair of inclined converging
  conveyer belts with one of the belts mounted to move with respect to the other belt
  to allow the transport of articles of various sizes therethrough.
