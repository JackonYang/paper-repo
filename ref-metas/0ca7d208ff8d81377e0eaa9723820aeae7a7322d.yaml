paperAbstract: Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these
  models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing and
  classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous models
  cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model
  which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve
  images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which
  use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence.
  They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression.
  DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA
  and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence
  description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences
  that describe the same image.
