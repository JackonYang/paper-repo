paperAbstract: A method is presented for the representation of (pictures of) faces.
  Within a specified framework the representation is ideal. This results in the characterization
  of a face, to within an error bound, by a relatively low-dimensional vector. The
  method is illustrated in detail by the use of an ensemble of pictures taken for
  this purpose.
