paperAbstract: "This paper presents a comparative study and survey of model-based\
  \ object-recognition algorithms for robot vision. The goal of these algorithms is\
  \ to recognize the identity, position, and orientation of randomly oriented industrial\
  \ parts. In one form this is commonly referred to as the \"bin-picking\" problem,\
  \ in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper\
  \ is organized according to 2-D, 2\xBD-D, and 3-D object representations, which\
  \ are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common\
  \ to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined\
  \ in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition\
  \ systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future\
  \ robot vision systems."
