paperAbstract: In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that implement
  a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a recently
  proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks
  of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed
  that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent
  units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM.
