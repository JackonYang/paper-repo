paperAbstract: We present Optimal Transport GAN (OT-GAN), a variant of generative
  adversarial nets minimizing a new metric measuring the distance between the generator
  distribution and the data distribution. This metric, which we call mini-batch energy
  distance, combines optimal transport in primal form with an energy distance defined
  in an adversarially learned feature space, resulting in a highly discriminative
  distance function with unbiased mini-batch gradients. Experimentally we show OT-GAN
  to be highly stable when trained with large mini-batches, and we present state-of-the-art
  results on several popular benchmark problems for image generation.
