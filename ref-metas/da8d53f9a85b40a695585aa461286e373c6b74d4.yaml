paperAbstract: Human pose estimation has made significant progress during the last
  years. However current datasets are limited in their coverage of the overall pose
  estimation challenges. Still these serve as the common sources to evaluate, train
  and compare different models on. In this paper we introduce a novel benchmark "MPII
  Human Pose" that makes a significant advance in terms of diversity and difficulty,
  a contribution that we feel is required for future developments in human body models.
  This comprehensive dataset was collected using an established taxonomy of over 800
  human activities [1]. The collected images cover a wider variety of human activities
  than previous datasets including various recreational, occupational and householding
  activities, and capture people from a wider range of viewpoints. We provide a rich
  set of labels including positions of body joints, full 3D torso and head orientation,
  occlusion labels for joints and body parts, and activity labels. For each image
  we provide adjacent video frames to facilitate the use of motion information. Given
  these rich annotations we perform a detailed analysis of leading human pose estimation
  approaches and gaining insights for the success and failures of these methods.
