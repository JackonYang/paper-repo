paperAbstract: This paper defines a multiple resolution representation for the two-dimensional
  gray-scale shapes in an image. This representation is constructed by detecting peaks
  and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes
  which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes
  in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation
  are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques
  are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from
  the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each
  bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform.
  Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution
  tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks
  for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges
  in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in
  a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple
  resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes
  elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining
  the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described.
  Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence
  at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions.
