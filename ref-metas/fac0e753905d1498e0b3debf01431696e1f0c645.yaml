paperAbstract: A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical dependency
  among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is
  measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals
  and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier
  expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural
  gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed
  for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily
  implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm
  are verified by computer simulations.
