paperAbstract: 'This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections
  are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the
  ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail.
  It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting
  in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this
  means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous
  or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces
  of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive
  scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have
  been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made
  as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum;
  and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts.
  A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism
  has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore,
  it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end
  state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the
  modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes
  clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is
  an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered
  mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes,
  it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution
  of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration
  experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst
  the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration
  experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict
  between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through
  the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through
  the orientation mechanism itself.'
