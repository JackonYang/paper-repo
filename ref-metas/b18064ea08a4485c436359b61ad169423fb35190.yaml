paperAbstract: This paper is concerned with developing fast nonrecursive algorithms
  for the minimum mean-squared error restoration of degraded images. The degradation
  is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread
  function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images
  by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve
  models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop
  minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration
  algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models
  are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images.
  By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not
  require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure
  of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier
  transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given.
