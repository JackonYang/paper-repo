paperAbstract: Slanted surfaces pose a problem for correspondence algorithms utilizing
  search because of the greatly increased number of possibilities, when compared with
  fronto-parallel surfaces. In this paper we propose an algorithm to compute correspondence
  between stereo images or between frames of a motion sequence by minimizing an energy
  functional that accounts for slanted surfaces. The energy is minimized in a greedy
  strategy that alternates between segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping
  regions (using the multiway-cut algorithm of Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih) and finding
  the affine parameters describing the displacement function of each region. A follow-up
  step enables the algorithm to escape local minima due to oversegmentation. Experiments
  on real images show the algorithm's ability to find an accurate segmentation and
  displacement map, as well as discontinuities and creases, from a wide variety of
  stereo and motion imagery.
