paperAbstract: Hidden Markov modeling is a probabilistic technique for the study of
  time series. Hidden Markov theory permits modeling with any of the classical probability
  distributions. The costs of implementation are linear in the length of data. Models
  can be nested to reflect hierarchical sources of knowledge. These and other desirable
  features have made hidden Markov methods increasingly attractive for problems in
  language, speech and signal processing. The basic ideas are introduced by elementary
  examples in the spirit of the Polya urn models. The main tool in hidden Markov modeling
  is the Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation
  of the model parameters. This iterative algorithm is discussed both from an intuitive
  point of view as an exercise in the art of counting and from a formal point of view
  via the information-theoretic Q-function. Selected examples drawn from the literature
  illustrate how the Baum-Welch technique places a rich variety of computational models
  at the disposal of the researcher.<<ETX>>
