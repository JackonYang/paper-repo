paperAbstract: 'We present an unsupervised approach for harvesting the data exposed
  by a set of structured and partially overlapping data-intensive web sources. Our
  proposal comes within a formal framework tackling two problems: the data extraction
  problem, to generate extraction rules based on the input websites, and the data
  integration problem, to integrate the extracted data in a unified schema. We introduce
  an original algorithm, WEIR, to solve the stated problems and formally prove its
  correctness. WEIR leverages the overlapping data among sources to make better decisions
  both in the data extraction (by pruning rules that do not lead to redundant information)
  and in the data integration (by reflecting local properties of a source over the
  mediated schema). Along the way, we characterize the amount of redundancy needed
  by our algorithm to produce a solution, and present experimental results to show
  the benefits of our approach with respect to existing solutions.'
