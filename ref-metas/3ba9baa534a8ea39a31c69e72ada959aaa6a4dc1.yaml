paperAbstract: A new class of convolutional codes called turbo-codes, whose performances
  in terms of bit error rate (BER) are close to the Shannon limit, is discussed. The
  turbo-code encoder is built using a parallel concatenation of two recursive systematic
  convolutional codes, and the associated decoder, using a feedback decoding rule,
  is implemented as P pipelined identical elementary decoders.<<ETX>>
