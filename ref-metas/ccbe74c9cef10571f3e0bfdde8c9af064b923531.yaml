paperAbstract: We present a new approach to referring expression generation, casting
  it as a density estimation problem where the goal is to learn distributions over
  logical expressions identifying sets of objects in the world. Despite an extremely
  large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally
  normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage
  approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the
  most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of
  references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn
  accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally,
  on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35%
  relative error reduction over previous state of the art.
