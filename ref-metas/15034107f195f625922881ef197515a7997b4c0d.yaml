paperAbstract: Hand-printed digits can be modeled as splines that are governed by
  about 8 control points. For each known digit, the control points have preferred
  "home" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control
  points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing
  Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized
  by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit
  model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes
  both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the
  model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total
  energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation,
  some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a
  poorly segmented image. The digit models learn by modifying the home locations of
  the control points.
