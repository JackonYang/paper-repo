paperAbstract: Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers
  to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these
  it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software.
  However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can
  be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there
  exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities,
  there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor
  readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed
  by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A
  machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures
  and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist,
  but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual
  tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language
  understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks,
  but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform
  them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct
  outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs
  to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly.
  In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the
  stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change
  frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer
  program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve
  the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned
  prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for
  each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted
  electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable
  to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide
  every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning
  system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering
  rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions
  as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of
  emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated
  the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena.
  Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people.
  Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying
  the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition,
  strategy change, etc.).
