paperAbstract: We present a class of statistical models for part-based object recognition
  that are explicitly parameterized according to the degree of spatial structure they
  can represent. These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that
  have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian
  models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree
  of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional
  spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization,
  and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We
  consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure,
  such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers
  to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively
  small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable
  recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower
  computational cost.
