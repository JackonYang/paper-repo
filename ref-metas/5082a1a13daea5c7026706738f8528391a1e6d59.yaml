paperAbstract: Summarization based on text extraction is inherently limited, but generation-style
  abstractive methods have proven challenging to build. In this work, we propose a
  fully data-driven approach to abstractive sentence summarization. Our method utilizes
  a local attention-based model that generates each word of the summary conditioned
  on the input sentence. While the model is structurally simple, it can easily be
  trained end-to-end and scales to a large amount of training data. The model shows
  significant performance gains on the DUC-2004 shared task compared with several
  strong baselines.
