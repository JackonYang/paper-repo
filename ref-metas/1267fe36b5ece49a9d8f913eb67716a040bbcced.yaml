paperAbstract: We study the numerical performance of a limited memory quasi-Newton
  method for large scale optimization, which we call the L-BFGS method. We compare
  its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which
  combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests
  indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir,
  and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show
  that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling.
  We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank
  and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton
  method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other
  problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We
  also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence
  on uniformly convex problems.
