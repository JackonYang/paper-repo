paperAbstract: We describe how to formulate matching and combinatorial problems of
  vision and neural network theory by generalizing elastic and deformable templates
  models to include binary matching elements. Techniques from statistical physics,
  which can be interpreted as computing marginal probability distributions, are then
  used to analyze these models and are shown to (1) relate them to existing theories
  and (2) give insight into the relations between, and relative effectivenesses of,
  existing theories. In particular we exploit the power of statistical techniques
  to put global constraints on the set of allowable states of the binary matching
  elements. The binary elements can then be removed analytically before minimization.
  This is demonstrated to be preferable to existing methods of imposing such constraints
  by adding bias terms in the energy functions. We give applications to winner-take-all
  networks, correspondence for stereo and long-range motion, the traveling salesman
  problem, deformable template matching, learning, content addressable memories, and
  models of brain development. The biological plausibility of these networks is briefly
  discussed.
