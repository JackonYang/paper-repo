paperAbstract: 'Distributed word representations have recently been proven to be an
  invaluable resource for NLP. These representations are normally learned using neural
  networks and capture syntactic and semantic information about words. Information
  about word morphology and shape is normally ignored when learning word representations.
  However, for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, intra-word information is extremely
  useful, specially when dealing with morphologically rich languages. In this paper,
  we propose a deep neural network that learns character-level representation of words
  and associate them with usual word representations to perform POS tagging. Using
  the proposed approach, while avoiding the use of any handcrafted feature, we produce
  state-of-the-art POS taggers for two languages: English, with 97.32% accuracy on
  the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus; and Portuguese, with 97.47% accuracy on the Mac-Morpho
  corpus, where the latter represents an error reduction of 12.2% on the best previous
  known result.'
