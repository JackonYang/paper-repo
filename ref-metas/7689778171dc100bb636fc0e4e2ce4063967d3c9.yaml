paperAbstract: The problem of quantitatively comparing the performance of different
  broad-coverage grammars of English has to date resisted solution. Prima facie, known
  English grammars appear to disagree strongly with each other as to the elements
  of even the simplest sentences. For instance, the grammars of Steve Abney (Bellcore),
  Ezra Black (IBM), Dan Flickinger (Hewlett Packard), Claudia Gdaniec (Logos), Ralph
  Grishman and Tomek Strzalkowski (NYU), Phil Harrison (Boeing), Don Hindle (AT&T),
  Bob Ingria (BBN), and Mitch Marcus (U. of Pennsylvania) recognize in common only
  the following constituents, when each grammarian provides the single parse which
  he/she would ideally want his/her grammar to specify for three sample Brown Corpus
  sentences:The famed Yankee Clipper, now retired, has been assisting (as (a batting
  coach)).One of those capital-gains ventures, in fact, has saddled him (with Gore
  Court).He said this constituted a (very serious) misuse (of the (Criminal court)
  processes).
