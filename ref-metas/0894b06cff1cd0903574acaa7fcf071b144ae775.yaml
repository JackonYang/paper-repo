paperAbstract: Recent work has shown success in using neural network language models
  (NNLMs) as features in MT systems. Here, we present a novel formulation for a neural
  network joint model (NNJM), which augments the NNLM with a source context window.
  Our model is purely lexicalized and can be integrated into any MT decoder. We also
  present several variations of the NNJM which provide significant additive improvements.
