paperAbstract: This survey describes the state of the art of online handwriting recognition
  during a period of renewed activity in the field. It is based on an extensive review
  of the literature, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and patents.
  Online versus offline recognition, digitizer technology, and handwriting properties
  and recognition problems are discussed. Shape recognition algorithms, preprocessing
  and postprocessing techniques, experimental systems, and commercial products are
  examined. >
