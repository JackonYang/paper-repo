paperAbstract: A previously proposed theory of visual processing, based on redundancy
  reduction, is used to derive the retinal transfer function including color. The
  predicted kernels show the nontrivial mixing of space-time with color coding observed
  in experiments. The differences in color-coding between species are found to be
  due to differences among the chromatic autocorrelators for natural scenes in different
  environments.
