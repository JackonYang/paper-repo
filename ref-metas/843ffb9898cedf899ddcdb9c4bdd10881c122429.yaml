paperAbstract: 'A boosting algorithm, based on the probably approximately correct
  (PAC) learning model is used to construct an ensemble of neural networks that significantly
  improves performance (compared to a single network) in optical character recognition
  (OCR) problems. The effect of boosting is reported on four handwritten image databases
  consisting of 12000 digits from segmented ZIP Codes from the United States Postal
  Service and the following from the National Institute of Standards and Technology:
  220000 digits, 45000 upper case letters, and 45000 lower case letters. We use two
  performance measures: the raw error rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required
  to achieve a 1% error rate on the patterns not rejected. Boosting improved performance
  significantly, and, in some cases, dramatically.'
