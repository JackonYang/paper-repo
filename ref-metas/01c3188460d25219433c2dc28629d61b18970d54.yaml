paperAbstract: We report theoretical and empirical properties of Gallager's (1963)
  low density parity check codes on Gaussian channels. It can be proved that, given
  an optimal decoder, these codes asymptotically approach the Shannon limit. With
  a practical 'belief propagation' decoder, performance substantially better than
  that of standard convolutional and concatenated codes can be achieved; indeed the
  performance is almost as close to the Shannon limit as that of turbo codes.
