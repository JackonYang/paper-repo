paperAbstract: There is a significant need for a realistic dataset on which to evaluate
  layout analysis methods and examine their performance in detail. This paper presents
  a new dataset (and the methodology used to create it) based on a wide range of contemporary
  documents. Strong emphasis is placed on comprehensive and detailed representation
  of both complex and simple layouts, and on colour originals. In-depth information
  is recorded both at the page and region level. Ground truth is efficiently created
  using a new semi-automated tool and stored in a new comprehensive XML representation,
  the PAGE format. The dataset can be browsed and searched via a web-based front end
  to the underlying database and suitable subsets (relevant to specific evaluation
  goals) can be selected and downloaded.
