paperAbstract: We describe AutoClass an approach to unsupervised classi cation based
  upon the classical mixture model supplemented by a Bayesian method for determining
  the optimal classes We include a moderately detailed exposition of the mathematics
  behind the AutoClass system We emphasize that no current unsupervised classi cation
  system can produce maximally useful results when operated alone It is the interaction
  between domain experts and the machine searching over the model space that generates
  new knowledge Both bring unique information and abilities to the database analysis
  task and each enhances the others e ectiveness We illustrate this point with several
  applications of AutoClass to complex real world databases and describe the resulting
  successes and failures
