paperAbstract: We study the problem of learning to accurately rank a set of objects
  by combining a given collection of ranking or preference functions. This problem
  of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as that of combining
  the results of different search engines, or the "collaborative-filtering" problem
  of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other users.
  In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem.
  We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining
  preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical
  results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new
  test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation
  of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two
  experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first
  experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each
  of which is a query expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering
  task for making movie recommendations.
