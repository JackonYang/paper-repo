paperAbstract: A visual attention system, inspired by the behavior and the neuronal
  architecture of the early primate visual system, is presented. Multiscale image
  features are combined into a single topographical saliency map. A dynamical neural
  network then selects attended locations in order of decreasing saliency. The system
  breaks down the complex problem of scene understanding by rapidly selecting, in
  a computationally efficient manner, conspicuous locations to be analyzed in detail.
