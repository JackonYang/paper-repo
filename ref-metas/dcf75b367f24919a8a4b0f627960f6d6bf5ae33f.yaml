paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a novel method for table structure analysis. Many
  documents have table areas, and some have both table and figure areas. It is very
  important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore,
  in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important
  pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is
  applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from
  text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are
  assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether
  each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table
  areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character
  strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was
  applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for
  software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and
  35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and
  91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly.'
