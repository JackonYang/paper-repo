paperAbstract: We present an approach for measuring similarity between visual entities
  (images or videos) based on matching internal self-similarities. What is correlated
  across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities
  (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities
  are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities
  are efficiently captured by a compact local "self-similarity descriptor"', measured
  densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local
  and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex
  visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only
  rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting
  complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure
  to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate
  its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection.
