paperAbstract: Many approaches to Bayesian image segmentation have used maximum a
  posteriori (MAP) estimation in conjunction with Markov random fields (MRF). Although
  this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact
  MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally
  expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult.
  The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly
  addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale
  random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP)
  estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator
  and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed
  in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number
  of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised
  estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the
  new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation
  using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification
  accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images
  with ground truth data.
