paperAbstract: The appearance of an object is composed of local structure. This local
  structure can be described and characterized by a vector of local features measured
  by local operators such as Gaussian derivatives or Gabor filters. This article presents
  a technique where appearances of objects are represented by the joint statistics
  of such local neighborhood operators. As such, this represents a new class of appearance
  based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the paper develops
  techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and
  orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that these techniques can identify
  over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the techniques
  have low complexity and therefore run in real-time.
