paperAbstract: "ion for Knowledge Acquisition\u201D by T. Bylander and B. Chadrasekaran.\
  \ Chandrasekaran\u2019s papers are usually illuminating, and this one does not fail:\
  \ He and Bylander re-examine such traditional beliefs as knowledge should be uniformly\
  \ represented and controlled and the knowledge base should be separated from the\
  \ inference engine. The final 10 papers in volume 1 discuss generalized learning\
  \ and ruleinduction techniques. They are interesting and informative, particularly\
  \ \u201CGeneralization and Noise\u201D by Y. Kodratoff and M. Manango, which discusses\
  \ symbolic and numeric rule induction. Most rule-induction techniques focus on the\
  \ use of examples and numeric analysis such as repertory grids. Kodratoff\u2019\
  s and Manango\u2019s exploration of how the two complement each other is refreshing.\
  \ Because of their technical nature and the amount of work it would take to put\
  \ their content to use, most of the papers in this section of the volume are more\
  \ appropriate for a specialized or research-oriented group. For those just getting\
  \ involved in knowledge-based\u2013systems development, Knowledge Acquisition Tools\
  \ for Expert Systems is the more useful volume. In addition to discussing the tools\
  \ themselves, most of the papers contain details of the knowledgeacquisition techniques\
  \ that are automated, thus providing much of the same information which is available\
  \ in the first volume. As an added benefit, they also often discuss the underlying\
  \ architectures for solving domain-specific problems. For instance, the details\
  \ of the medical diagnostic architecture laid out in \u201CDesign for Acquisition:\
  \ Principles of Knowledge System Design to Facilitate Knowledge Acquisition\u201D\
  \ by T. R. Gruber and P. R. Cohen are almost as useful as the discussion of how\
  \ to build a knowledge-acquisition system. Volume 2 is particularly germane given\
  \ the rise in commercial interest about automated knowledge acquisition following\
  \ this year\u2019s introduction of Neuron Data\u2019s NEXTRATM product and last\
  \ year\u2019s introduction of Test Bench by Texas Instruments. Test Bench is actually\
  \ discussed in \u201CA Mixed-Initiative Workbench for Knowledge Acquisition\u201D\
  \ by G. S. Kahn, E. H. Breaux, P. De Klerk, and R. L. Joseph. This volume provides\
  \ the background necessary to evaluate knowledge-acquisition tools such as NEXTRA,\
  \ Test Bench, and AutoIntelligence (IntelligenceWare). The vendors of knowledge-based\u2013\
  systems development tools, for example, Inference, IntelliCorp, Aion, AI Corp.,\
  \ and IBM, would do well to pay heed to these books because they point the way to\
  \ removing the knowledge bottleneck from knowledge-based\u2013systems development.\
  \ Overall, the papers in both volumes are comprehensive and well integrated, a sometimes\
  \ difficult state to achieve when compiling a collection of papers resulting from\
  \ a small conference. The collection is comparable to Anna Hart\u2019s Knowledge\
  \ Acquisition for Expert Systems (McGraw-Hill, 1986), but it is broader in scope\
  \ and not as structured. The arrangement of the papers is marred only by an overly\
  \ brief index. Few readers can be expected to read a collection from beginning to\
  \ end, and a better index would facilitate more enlightened use. Less important\u2014\
  but nevertheless distracting\u2014is the large number of typographical errors in\
  \ both volumes. In conclusion, the set is recommended for both the commercial and\
  \ research knowledge-based\u2013systems practitioner. Reading the volumes in reverse\
  \ order might be more useful to the commercial developer given the extra information\
  \ available in volume 2. Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research"
