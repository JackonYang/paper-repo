paperAbstract: The use of Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to pretrain Neural Networks has
  recently led to a resurgence in the use of Artificial Neural Network Hidden Markov
  Model (ANN/HMM) hybrid systems for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this paper
  we report results of a DBN-pretrained context-dependent ANN/HMM system trained on
  two datasets that are much larger than any reported previously with DBN-pretrained
  ANN/HMM systems 5870 hours of Voice Search and 1400 hours of YouTube data. On the
  first dataset, the pretrained ANN/HMM system outperforms the best Gaussian Mixture
  Model Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) baseline, built with a much larger dataset by
  3.7% absolute WER, while on the second dataset, it outperforms the GMM/HMM baseline
  by 4.7% absolute. Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) fine tuning and model combination
  using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCARF) give additional gains of 0.1%
  and 0.4% on the first dataset and 0.5% and 0.9% absolute on the second dataset.
