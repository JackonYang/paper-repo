paperAbstract: "Image captioning aims at generating a natural language description\
  \ of an image. Open domain captioning is a very challenging task, as it requires\
  \ a fine-grained understanding of the global and the local entities in an image,\
  \ as well as their attributes and relationships. The recently released MSCOCO challenge\
  \ [1] provides a new, larger scale platform for evaluating image captioning systems,\
  \ complete with an evaluation server for benchmarking competing methods. Deep learning\
  \ approaches to sequence modeling have yielded impressive results on the task, dominating\
  \ the task leaderboard. Inspired by the recently introduced encoder/decoder paradigm\
  \ for machine translation using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [2], [3], and [4]\
  \ use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to encode the input image, and a\
  \ Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [5] RNN decoder to generate the output caption.\
  \ These systems are trained end-to-end using back-propagation, and have achieved\
  \ state-of-the-art results on MSCOCO. More recently in [6], the use of spatial attention\
  \ mechanisms on CNN layers to incorporate visual context\u2014which implicitly conditions\
  \ on the text generated so far\u2014was incorporated into the generation process."
