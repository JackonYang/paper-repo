paperAbstract: In this paper, we introduce a new top-down framework for automatic
  localization and recognition of text-based traffic guide panels (http://tinyurl.com/wiki-guide-signs)
  captured by car-mounted cameras from natural scene images. The proposed framework
  involves two contributions. First, a novel Cascaded Localization Network (CLN) joining
  two customized convolutional nets is proposed to detect the guide panels and the
  scene text on them in a coarse-to-fine manner. In this network, the popular character-wise
  text saliency detection is replaced with string-wise text region detection, which
  avoids numerous bottom-up processing steps such as character clustering and segmentation.
  Text information contained within detected text regions is then interpreted by a
  deep recurrent model without character segmentation required. Second, a temporal
  fusion of text region proposals across consecutive frames is introduced to significantly
  reduce the redundant computation in neighboring frames. A new challenging Traffic
  Guide Panel dataset is collected to train and evaluate the proposed framework, instead
  of the unsuited symbol-based traffic sign datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our proposed framework outperforms multiple recently published text spotting
  frameworks in real highway scenarios.
