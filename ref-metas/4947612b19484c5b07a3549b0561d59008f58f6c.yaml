paperAbstract: Text characters and strings in natural scene can provide valuable information
  for many applications. Extracting text directly from natural scene images or videos
  is a challenging task because of diverse text patterns and variant background interferences.
  This paper proposes a method of scene text recognition from detected text regions.
  In text detection, our previously proposed algorithms are applied to obtain text
  regions from scene image. First, we design a discriminative character descriptor
  by combining several state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors. Second,
  we model character structure at each character class by designing stroke configuration
  maps. Our algorithm design is compatible with the application of scene text extraction
  in smart mobile devices. An Android-based demo system is developed to show the effectiveness
  of our proposed method on scene text information extraction from nearby objects.
  The demo system also provides us some insight into algorithm design and performance
  improvement of scene text extraction. The evaluation results on benchmark data sets
  demonstrate that our proposed scheme of text recognition is comparable with the
  best existing methods.
