paperAbstract: It is always well believed that modeling relationships between objects
  would be helpful for representing and eventually describing an image. Nevertheless,
  there has not been evidence in support of the idea on image description generation.
  In this paper, we introduce a new design to explore the connections between objects
  for image captioning under the umbrella of attention-based encoder-decoder framework.
  Specifically, we present Graph Convolutional Networks plus Long Short-Term Memory
  (dubbed as GCN-LSTM) architecture that novelly integrates both semantic and spatial
  object relationships into image encoder. Technically, we build graphs over the detected
  objects in an image based on their spatial and semantic connections. The representations
  of each region proposed on objects are then refined by leveraging graph structure
  through GCN. With the learnt region-level features, our GCN-LSTM capitalizes on
  LSTM-based captioning framework with attention mechanism for sentence generation.
  Extensive experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset, and superior
  results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably,
  GCN-LSTM increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1% to 128.7% on COCO testing set.
