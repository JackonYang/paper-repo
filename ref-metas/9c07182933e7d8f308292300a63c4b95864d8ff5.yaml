paperAbstract: In ordinary independent component analysis, the components are assumed
  to be completely independent, and they do not necessarily have any meaningful order
  relationships. In practice, however, the estimated independent components are often
  not at all independent. We propose that this residual dependence structure could
  be used to define a topo-graphic order for the components. In particular, a distance
  between two components could be defined using their higher-order correlations, and
  this distance could be used to create a topographic representation. Thus, we obtain
  a linear decomposition into approximately independent components, where the dependence
  of two components is approximated by the proximity of the components in the topographic
  representation.
