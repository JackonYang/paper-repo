paperAbstract: IBM Research undertook a challenge to build a computer system that
  could compete at the human champion level in real time on the American TV Quiz show,
  Jeopardy! The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant
  on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us
  address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation
  of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about
  20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision,
  confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that
  DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation
  for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques
  to rapidly advance the field of QA.
