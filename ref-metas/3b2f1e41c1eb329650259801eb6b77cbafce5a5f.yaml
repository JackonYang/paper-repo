paperAbstract: An efficient word spotting framework is proposed to search text in
  scanned books. The proposed method allows one to search for words when optical character
  recognition (OCR) fails due to noise or for languages where there is no OCR. Given
  a query word image, the aim is to retrieve matching words in the book sorted by
  the similarity. In the offline stage, SIFT descriptors are extracted over the corner
  points of each word image. Those features are quantized into visual terms (visterms)
  using hierarchical K-Means algorithm and indexed using an inverted file. In the
  query resolution stage, the candidate matches are efficiently identified using the
  inverted index. These word images are then forwarded to the next stage where the
  configuration of visterms on the image plane are tested. Configuration matching
  is efficiently performed by projecting the visterms on the horizontal axis and searching
  for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the sequences of visterms. The
  proposed framework is tested on one English and two Telugu books. It is shown that
  the proposed method resolves a typical user query under 10 milliseconds providing
  very high retrieval accuracy (Mean Average Precision 0.93). The search accuracy
  for the English book is comparable to searching text in the high accuracy output
  of a commercial OCR engine.
