paperAbstract: The sampling theory of stationary processes in space is not completely
  analogous to that of stationary time series, due to the fact that the variate of
  a time series is influenced only by past values, while for a spatial process dependence
  extends in all directions. This point is elaborated in ?? 2-4. The estimation and
  test theory developed in ? 7 is applied in ? 8 to uniformity data for wheat and
  oranges. The final section is devoted to an examination of some particular two-dimensional
  processes.
