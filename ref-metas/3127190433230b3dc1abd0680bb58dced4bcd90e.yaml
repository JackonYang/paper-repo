paperAbstract: 'Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has
  shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions
  of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software
  framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of
  machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms
  for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic
  gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii)
  Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization
  procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster
  L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully
  used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the
  literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object
  recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same
  techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network
  for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance
  of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms
  are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm.'
