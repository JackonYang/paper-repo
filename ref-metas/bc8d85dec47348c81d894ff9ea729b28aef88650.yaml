paperAbstract: In this paper, we define the table detection problem as a probability
  optimization problem. We begin, as we do in our previous algorithm, finding and
  validating each detected table candidates. We proceed to compute a set of probability
  measurements for each of the table entities. The computation of the probability
  measurements takes into consideration tables, table text separators and table neighboring
  text blocks. Then, an iterative updating method is used to optimize the page segmentation
  probability to obtain the final result. This new algorithm shows a great improvement
  over our previous algorithm. The training and testing data set for the algorithm
  include 1, 125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10, 934 cell
  entities. Compared with our previous work, it raised the accuracy rate to 95.67%
  from 90.32% and to 97.05% from 92.04%.
