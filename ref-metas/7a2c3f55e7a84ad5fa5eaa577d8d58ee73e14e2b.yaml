paperAbstract: Outlines a fast and efficient method for extracting graphics and text
  paragraphs from printed documents. The method presented is based on bottom-up approach
  to document analysis and it achieves very good performance in most cases. During
  the preprocessing characters are linked together to form blocks. Created blocks
  are segmented, labelled and merged into paragraphs. Simultaneously, graphics are
  extracted from the image. Algorithms for each step of processing are presented.
  Also, the obtained experimental results are included.<<ETX>>
