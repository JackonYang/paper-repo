paperAbstract: This article presents our recent study of a lightweight Deep Convolutional
  Neural Network (DCNN) architecture for document image classification. Here, we concentrated
  on training of a committee of generalized, compact and powerful base DCNNs. A support
  vector machine (SVM) is used to combine the outputs of individual DCNNs. The main
  novelty of the present study is introduction of supervised layerwise training of
  DCNN architecture in document classification tasks for better initialization of
  weights of individual DCNNs. Each DCNN of the committee is trained for a specific
  part or the whole document. Also, here we used the principle of generalized stacking
  for combining the normalized outputs of all the members of the DCNN committee. The
  proposed document classification strategy has been tested on the well-known Tobacco3482
  document image dataset. Results of our experimentations show that the proposed strategy
  involving a considerably smaller network architecture can produce comparable document
  classification accuracies in competition with the state-of-the-art architectures
  making it more suitable for use in comparatively low configuration mobile devices.
