paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for labelling problems which
  is able to combine multiple segmentations in a principled manner. Our method is
  based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets
  of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms.
  These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a
  generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials.
  The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the
  Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by
  Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions
  composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This
  enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing
  inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object
  segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with
  higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data
  sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively
  improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe
  that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling
  problems.
