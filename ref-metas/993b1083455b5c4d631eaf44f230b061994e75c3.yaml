paperAbstract: The authors present an efficient architecture to synthesize filters
  of arbitrary orientations from linear combinations of basis filters, allowing one
  to adaptively steer a filter to any orientation, and to determine analytically the
  filter output as a function of orientation. Steerable filters may be designed in
  quadrature pairs to allow adaptive control over phase as well as orientation. The
  authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use
  in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection,
  and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation.
  The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >
