paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a new latent semantic model that incorporates
  a convolutional-pooling structure over word sequences to learn low-dimensional,
  semantic vector representations for search queries and Web documents. In order to
  capture the rich contextual structures in a query or a document, we start with each
  word within a temporal context window in a word sequence to directly capture contextual
  features at the word n-gram level. Next, the salient word n-gram features in the
  word sequence are discovered by the model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level
  feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level
  semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full
  text string. The proposed convolutional latent semantic model (CLSM) is trained
  on clickthrough data and is evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a large-scale,
  real-world data set. Results show that the proposed model effectively captures salient
  semantic information in queries and documents for the task while significantly outperforming
  previous state-of-the-art semantic models.
