paperAbstract: To UNDERSTAND VISION in physiological terms represents a formidable
  problem for the biologist. I t am0 unts to learning how the nervous system handles
  incoming messages so that form, color, movement, and depth can be perceived and
  interpreted. One approach, perhaps the most direct, is to stimulate the retina with
  patterns of light while recording from single cells or fibers at various points
  along the visual pa thway. For each cell the optimum stimulus can be determined,
  and one can note the charac teristics common to cells at the next. each level in
  the visual pathway, and compare a given level with
