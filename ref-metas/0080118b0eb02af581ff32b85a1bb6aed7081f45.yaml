paperAbstract: Optimal transport distances are a fundamental family of distances for
  probability measures and histograms of features. Despite their appealing theoretical
  properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation,
  their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost can quickly
  become prohibitive whenever the size of the support of these measures or the histograms'
  dimension exceeds a few hundred. We propose in this work a new family of optimal
  transport distances that look at transport problems from a maximum-entropy perspective.
  We smooth the classic optimal transport problem with an entropic regularization
  term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed
  through Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of
  magnitude faster than that of transport solvers. We also show that this regularized
  distance improves upon classic optimal transport distances on the MNIST classification
  problem.
