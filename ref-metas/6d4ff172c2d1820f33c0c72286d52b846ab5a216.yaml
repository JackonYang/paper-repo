paperAbstract: Is strong supervision necessary for learning a good visual representation?
  Do we really need millions of semantically-labeled images to train a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN)? In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly powerful
  approach for unsupervised learning of CNN. Specifically, we use hundreds of thousands
  of unlabeled videos from the web to learn visual representations. Our key idea is
  that visual tracking provides the supervision. That is, two patches connected by
  a track should have similar visual representation in deep feature space since they
  probably belong to same object or object part. We design a Siamese-triplet network
  with a ranking loss function to train this CNN representation. Without using a single
  image from ImageNet, just using 100K unlabeled videos and the VOC 2012 dataset,
  we train an ensemble of unsupervised networks that achieves 52% mAP (no bounding
  box regression). This performance comes tantalizingly close to its ImageNet-supervised
  counterpart, an ensemble which achieves a mAP of 54.4%. We also show that our unsupervised
  network can perform competitively in other tasks such as surface-normal estimation.
