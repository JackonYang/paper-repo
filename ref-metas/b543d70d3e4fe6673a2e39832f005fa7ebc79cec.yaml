paperAbstract: Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can be used for a wide variety of vision
  problems. In this paper we focus on MRFs with two-valued clique potentials, which
  form a generalized Potts model. We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of
  such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph.
  We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum
  multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in
  our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth.
  We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials.
