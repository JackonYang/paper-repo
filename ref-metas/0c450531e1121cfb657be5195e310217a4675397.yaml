paperAbstract: 'In typical classification tasks, we seek a function which assigns
  a label to a single object. Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines
  (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method
  of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use
  high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However,
  many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple
  labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem,
  assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely,
  probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations
  between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional
  feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper,
  we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum
  margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with
  high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured
  data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact
  quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization
  in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition
  and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over
  previous approaches.'
