paperAbstract: "We present a method to learn visual attributes (eg.\u201Cred\u201D\
  , \u201Cmetal\u201D, \u201Cspotted\u201D) and object classes (eg. \u201Ccar\u201D\
  , \u201Cdress\u201D, \u201Cumbrella\u201D) together. We assume images are labeled\
  \ with category, but not location, of an instance. We estimate models with an iterative\
  \ procedure: the current model is used to produce a saliency score, which, together\
  \ with a homogeneity cue, identifies likely locations for the object (resp. attribute);\
  \ then those locations are used to produce better models with multiple instance\
  \ learning. Crucially, the object and attribute models must agree on the potential\
  \ locations of an object. This means that the more accurate of the two models can\
  \ guide the improvement of the less accurate model. Our method is evaluated on two\
  \ data sets of images of real scenes, one in which the attribute is color and the\
  \ other in which it is material. We show that our joint learning produces improved\
  \ detectors. We demonstrate generalization by detecting attribute-object pairs which\
  \ do not appear in our training data. The iteration gives significant improvement\
  \ in performance."
