paperAbstract: The boom of deep learning induced many industries and academies to
  introduce machine learning based approaches into their concern, competitively. However,
  existing machine learning frameworks are limited to sufficiently fulfill the collaboration
  and management for both data and models. We proposed NSML, a machine learning as
  a service (MLaaS) platform, to meet these demands. NSML helps machine learning work
  be easily launched on a NSML cluster and provides a collaborative environment which
  can afford development at enterprise scale. Finally, NSML users can deploy their
  own commercial services with NSML cluster. In addition, NSML furnishes convenient
  visualization tools which assist the users in analyzing their work. To verify the
  usefulness and accessibility of NSML, we performed some experiments with common
  examples. Furthermore, we examined the collaborative advantages of NSML through
  three competitions with real-world use cases.
