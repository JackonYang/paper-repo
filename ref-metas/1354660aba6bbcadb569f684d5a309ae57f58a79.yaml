paperAbstract: Abstract We introduce a methodology for performing approximate computations
  in very complex probabilistic systems (e.g. huge pedigrees). Our approach, called
  blocking Gibbs, combines exact local computations with Gibbs sampling in a way that
  complements the strengths of both. The methodology is illustrated on a real-world
  problem involving a heavily inbred pedigreee containing 20 000 individuals. We present
  results showing that blocking-Gibbs sampling converges much faster than plain Gibbs
  sampling for very complex problems.
