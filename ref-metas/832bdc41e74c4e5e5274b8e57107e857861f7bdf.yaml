paperAbstract: Extracting structured data from HTML documents is a long-studied problem
  with a broad range of applications like augmenting knowledge bases, supporting faceted
  search, and providing domain-specific experiences for key verticals like shopping
  and movies. Previous approaches have either required a small number of examples
  for each target site or relied on carefully handcrafted heuristics built over visual
  renderings of websites. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage neural approach,
  named FreeDOM, which overcomes both these limitations. The first stage learns a
  representation for each DOM node in the page by combining both the text and markup
  information. The second stage captures longer range distance and semantic relatedness
  using a relational neural network. By combining these stages, FreeDOM is able to
  generalize to unseen sites after training on a small number of seed sites from that
  vertical without requiring expensive hand-crafted features over visual renderings
  of the page. Through experiments on a public dataset with 8 different verticals,
  we show that FreeDOM beats the previous state of the art by nearly 3.7 F1 points
  on average without requiring features over rendered pages or expensive hand-crafted
  features.
