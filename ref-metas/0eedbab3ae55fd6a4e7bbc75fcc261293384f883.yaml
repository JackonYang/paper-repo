paperAbstract: Many application domains suffer from not having enough labeled training
  data for learning. However, large amounts of unlabeled examples can often be gathered
  cheaply. As a result, there has been a great deal of work in recent years on how
  unlabeled data can be used to aid classification. We consider an algorithm based
  on finding minimum cuts in graphs, that uses pairwise relationships among the examples
  in order to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data.
