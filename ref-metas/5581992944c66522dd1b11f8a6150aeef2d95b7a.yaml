paperAbstract: Subjectivity tagging is distinguishing sentences used to present opinions
  and evaluations from sentences used to objectively present factual information.
  There are numerous applications for which subjectivity tagging is relevant, including
  information extraction and information retrieval. This paper identifies strong clues
  of subjectivity using the results of a method for clustering words according to
  distributional similarity (Lin 1998), seeded by a small amount of detailed manual
  annotation. These features are then further refined with the addition of lexical
  semantic features of adjectives, specifically polarity and gradability (Hatzivassiloglou
  & McKeown 1997), which can be automatically learned from corpora. In 10-fold cross
  validation experiments, features based on both similarity clusters and the lexical
  semantic features are shown to have higher precision than features based on each
  alone.
