paperAbstract: The problem of learning a general input-output relation using a layered
  neural network is discussed in a statistical framework. By imposing the consistency
  condition that the error minimization be equivalent to a likelihood maximization
  for training the network, the authors arrive at a Gibbs distribution on a canonical
  ensemble of networks with the same architecture. This statistical description enables
  them to evaluate the probability of a correct prediction of an independent example,
  after training the network on a given training set. The prediction probability is
  highly correlated with the generalization ability of the network, as measured outside
  the training set. This suggests a general and practical criterion for training layered
  networks by minimizing prediction errors. The authors demonstrate the utility of
  this criterion for selecting the optimal architecture in the continuity problem.
  As a theoretical application of the statistical formalism, they discuss the question
  of learning curves and estimate the sufficient training size needed for correct
  generalization, in a simple example.<<ETX>>
