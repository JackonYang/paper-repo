paperAbstract: Directionally selective single units have recently been found in the
  cerebral cortex of cats (Hubel, 1959; Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962), the optic tectum
  of frogs and pigeons (Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch & Pitts, 1959; Maturana & Frenk,
  1963), and the retinae of rabbits (Barlow & Hill, 1963; Barlow, Hill & Levick, 1964).
  The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge
  of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction
  (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called
  null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different
  units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement
  of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions
  cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding
  on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is
  unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot
  or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel
  (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could
  be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive
  field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the
  foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow
  & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments
  which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations
  of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response
  varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results
  we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within
  the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that
