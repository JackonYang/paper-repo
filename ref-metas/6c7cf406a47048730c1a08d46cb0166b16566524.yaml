paperAbstract: In this document, the SURF detector-descriptor scheme used in the OpenSURF
  library is discussed in detail. First the algorithm is analysed from a theoretical
  standpoint to provide a detailed overview of how and why it works. Next the design
  and development choices for the implementation of the library are discussed and
  justified. During the implementation of the library, it was found that some of the
  finer details of the algorithm had been omitted or overlooked, so Section 1.5 serves
  to make clear the concepts which are not explicitly defined in the SURF paper [1].
