paperAbstract: Experimentol corroboration was obtained for the hypothesis that the
  proportion of words common to the contexts of word A and to the contexts of word
  B is a function of the degree to which A and B are similar in meaning. The tests
  were carried out for variously defined contexts. The shapes of the functions, however,
  indicate that similarity of context is reliable as criterion only for detecting
  pairs of words that are very similar in meaning.
