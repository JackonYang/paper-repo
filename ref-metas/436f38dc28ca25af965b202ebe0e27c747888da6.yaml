paperAbstract: 'In this paper a signal modeling technique based upon finite mixture
  autoregressive probabilistic functions of Markov chains is developed and applied
  to the problem of speech recognition, particularly speaker-independent recognition
  of isolated digits. Two types of mixture probability densities are investigated:
  finite mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive densities (GAM) and nearest-neighbor
  partitioned finite mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive densities (PGAM). In the
  former (GAM), the observation density in each Markov state is simply a (stochastically
  constrained) weighted sum of Gaussian autoregressive densities, while in the latter
  (PGAM) it involves nearest-neighbor decoding which in effect, defines a set of partitions
  on the observation space. In this paper we discuss the signal modeling methodology
  and give experimental results on speaker independent recognition of isolated digits.
  We also discuss the potential use of the modeling technique for other applications.'
