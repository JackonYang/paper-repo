paperAbstract: This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data Driven Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian, statistical framework.
  The paper contributes to image segmentation in three aspects. Firstly, it designs
  effective and well balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space
  and makes the split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation.
  Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial segmentations.
  Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a posteriori solution, it proposes
  a mathematical principle for computing multiple distinct solutions to incorporates
  intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed
  for extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence. Thirdly,
  it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection,
  to compute importance proposal probabilities, which effectively drive the Markov
  chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion
  method. Thus DDM-CMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing
  segmentation algorithms, such as; edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge,
  SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics
  or computing importance proposal probabilities. We report some results on color
  and grey level image segmentation in this paper and refer to a detailed report and
  a web site for extensive discussion.
