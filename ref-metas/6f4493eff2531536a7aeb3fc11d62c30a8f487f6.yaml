paperAbstract: Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification
  methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm
  to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority
  vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms,
  this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that
  this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical
  principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem,
  boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic
  scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct
  approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting.
  Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that
  exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations
  of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification
  to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally,
  we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision
  trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads
  to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate
  decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to
  large-scale data mining applications.
