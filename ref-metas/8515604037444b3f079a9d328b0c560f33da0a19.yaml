paperAbstract: 'One of the major drawbacks of orthogonal wavelet transforms is their
  lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under
  translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect
  to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input
  signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance
  called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of
  aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the
  sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains,
  particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously
  shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable
  transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable
  in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position
  and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis,
  stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >'
