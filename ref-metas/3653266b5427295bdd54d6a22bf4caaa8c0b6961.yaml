paperAbstract: An ensemble consists of a set of independently trained classifiers
  (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when
  classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole
  is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging
  (Breiman 1996a) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) are two relatively new but
  popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods
  using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithms.
  Our results clearly show two important facts. The first is that even though Bagging
  almost always produces a better classifier than any of its individual component
  classifiers and is relatively impervious to overfitting, it does not generalize
  any better than a baseline neural-network ensemble method. The second is that Boosting
  is a powerful technique that can usually produce better ensembles than Bagging;
  however, it is more susceptible to noise and can quickly overfit a data set.
