paperAbstract: "The promise of unsupervised learning methods lies in their potential\
  \ to use vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn complex, highly nonlinear models\
  \ with millions of free parameters. We consider two well-known unsupervised learning\
  \ models, deep belief networks (DBNs) and sparse coding, that have recently been\
  \ applied to a flurry of machine learning applications (Hinton & Salakhutdinov,\
  \ 2006; Raina et al., 2007). Unfortunately, current learning algorithms for both\
  \ models are too slow for large-scale applications, forcing researchers to focus\
  \ on smaller-scale models, or to use fewer training examples.\n In this paper, we\
  \ suggest massively parallel methods to help resolve these problems. We argue that\
  \ modern graphics processors far surpass the computational capabilities of multicore\
  \ CPUs, and have the potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised\
  \ learning methods. We develop general principles for massively parallelizing unsupervised\
  \ learning tasks using graphics processors. We show that these principles can be\
  \ applied to successfully scaling up learning algorithms for both DBNs and sparse\
  \ coding. Our implementation of DBN learning is up to 70 times faster than a dual-core\
  \ CPU implementation for large models. For example, we are able to reduce the time\
  \ required to learn a four-layer DBN with 100 million free parameters from several\
  \ weeks to around a single day. For sparse coding, we develop a simple, inherently\
  \ parallel algorithm, that leads to a 5 to 15-fold speedup over previous methods."
