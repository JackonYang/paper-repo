paperAbstract: Understanding how images of objects and scenes behave in response to
  specific ego-motions is a crucial aspect of proper visual development, yet existing
  visual learning methods are conspicuously disconnected from the physical source
  of their images. We propose to exploit proprioceptive motor signals to provide unsupervised
  regularization in convolutional neural networks to learn visual representations
  from egocentric video. Specifically, we enforce that our learned features exhibit
  equivariance, i.e, they respond predictably to transformations associated with distinct
  ego-motions. With three datasets, we show that our unsupervised feature learning
  approach significantly outperforms previous approaches on visual recognition and
  next-best-view prediction tasks. In the most challenging test, we show that features
  learned from video captured on an autonomous driving platform improve large-scale
  scene recognition in static images from a disjoint domain.
