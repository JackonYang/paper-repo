paperAbstract: We describe two attempt to improve our stochastic language models.
  In the first, we identify a systematic overestimation in the traditional backoff
  model, and use statistical reasoning to correct it. Our modification results in
  up to 6% reduction in the perplexity of various tasks. Although the improvement
  is modest, it is achieved with hardly any increase in the complexity of the model.
  Both analysis and empirical data suggest that the modification is most suitable
  when training data is sparse.In the second attempt, we propose a new type of adaptive
  language model. Existing adaptive models use a dynamic cache, based on the history
  of the document seen up to that point. But another source of information in the
  history, within-document word sequence correlations, has not yet been tapped. We
  describe a model that attempts to capture this information, using a framework where
  one word sequence triggers another, causing its estimated probability to be raised.
  We discuss various issues in the design of such a model, and describe our first
  attempt at building one. Our preliminary results include a perplexity reduction
  of between 10% and 32%, depending on the test set.
