paperAbstract: 'Many methods on form document image analysis have been proposed, but
  few have treated the extraction of logical structure. A new method for the logical
  structure extraction of form document is proposed in this paper. The algorithm of
  it consists of three phases: global division of the whole document, local logical
  structure analysis and global re- division of the whole document. GLG method emphasizes
  the global layout structure analysis and has higher accuracy. It is robust for treating
  with the accidental direct adjacent relationship between two irrelated cells. In
  addition, a logical structure tree is proposed to represent the logical structure
  of a form document.'
