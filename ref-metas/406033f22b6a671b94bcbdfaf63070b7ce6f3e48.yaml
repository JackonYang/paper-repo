paperAbstract: Unrestricted English text can be converted to speech by applying phonological
  rules and handling exceptions with a look-up table. However, this approach is highly
  labor intensive since each entry and rule must be hand-crafted. NETtalk is an alternative
  approach that is based on an automated learning procedure for a parallel network
  of deterministic processing units. ~ f t e r ' training on a corpus of informal
  continuous speech, it achieves good performance and generalizes to novel words.
  The distributed internal representations of the phonological regularities discovered
  by the network are damage resistant.
