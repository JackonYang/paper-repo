paperAbstract: 'For the purposes of the present discussion, the term structure will
  be used in the following non-rigorous sense: A set of phonemes or a set of data
  is structured in respect to some feature, to the extent that we can form in terms
  of that feature some organized system of statements which describes the members
  of the set and their interrelations (at least up to some limit of complexity). In
  this sense, language can be structured in respect to various independent features.
  And whether it is structured (to more than a trivial extent) in respect to, say,
  regular historical change, social intercourse, meaning, or distribution - or to
  what extent it is structured in any of these respects - is a matter decidable by
  investigation. Here we will discuss how each language can be described in terms
  of a distributional structure, i.e. in terms of the occurrence of parts (ultimately
  sounds) relative to other parts, and how this description is complete without intrusion
  of other features such as history or meaning. It goes without saying that other
  studies of language - historical, psychological, etc.-are also possible, both in
  relation to distributional structure and independently of it.'
