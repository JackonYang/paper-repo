paperAbstract: "Given a set of images of scenes containing multiple object categories\
  \ (e.g. grass, roads, buildings) our objective is to discover these objects in each\
  \ image in an unsupervised manner, and to use this object distribution to perform\
  \ scene classification. We achieve this discovery using probabilistic Latent Semantic\
  \ Analysis (pLSA), a generative model from the statistical text literature, here\
  \ applied to a bag of visual words representation for each image. The scene classification\
  \ on the object distribution is carried out by a k-nearest neighbour classifier.\
  \ \n \nWe investigate the classification performance under changes in the visual\
  \ vocabulary and number of latent topics learnt, and develop a novel vocabulary\
  \ using colour SIFT descriptors. Classification performance is compared to the supervised\
  \ approaches of Vogel & Schiele [19] and Oliva & Torralba [11], and the semi-supervised\
  \ approach of Fei Fei & Perona [3] using their own datasets and testing protocols.\
  \ In all cases the combination of (unsupervised) pLSA followed by (supervised) nearest\
  \ neighbour classification achieves superior results. We show applications of this\
  \ method to image retrieval with relevance feedback and to scene classification\
  \ in videos."
