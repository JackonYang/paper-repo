paperAbstract: Building visual recognition models that adapt across different domains
  is a challenging task for computer vision. While feature-learning machines in the
  form of hierarchial feed-forward models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) showed
  promise in this direction, they are still difficult to train especially when few
  training examples are available. In this paper, we present a framework for training
  hierarchical feed-forward models for visual recognition, using transfer learning
  from pseudo tasks. These pseudo tasks are automatically constructed from data without
  supervision and comprise a set of simple pattern-matching operations. We show that
  these pseudo tasks induce an informative inverse-Wishart prior on the functional
  behavior of the network, offering an effective way to incorporate useful prior knowledge
  into the network training. In addition to being extremely simple to implement, and
  adaptable across different domains with little or no extra tuning, our approach
  achieves promising results on challenging visual recognition tasks, including object
  recognition, gender recognition, and ethnicity recognition.
