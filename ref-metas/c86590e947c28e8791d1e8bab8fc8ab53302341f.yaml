paperAbstract: In the work described here, the backpropagation neural network learning
  procedure is applied to the analysis and recognition of speech. This procedure takes
  a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship;
  it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning.
  A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of
  these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without
  labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies
  demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with
  accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that
  requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous
  speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units
  which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as
  well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained
  on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed
  interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and
  label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that
  backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature
  structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition.
