paperAbstract: 'We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently
  introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple
  new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs,
  and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization
  by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout''s fast approximate model averaging
  technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of
  these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification
  performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.'
