paperAbstract: 'We marry two powerful ideas: deep representation learning for visual
  recognition and language understanding, and symbolic program execution for reasoning.
  Our neural-symbolic visual question answering (NS-VQA) system first recovers a structural
  scene representation from the image and a program trace from the question. It then
  executes the program on the scene representation to obtain an answer. Incorporating
  symbolic structure as prior knowledge offers three unique advantages. First, executing
  programs on a symbolic space is more robust to long program traces; our model can
  solve complex reasoning tasks better, achieving an accuracy of 99.8% on the CLEVR
  dataset. Second, the model is more data- and memory-efficient: it performs well
  after learning on a small number of training data; it can also encode an image into
  a compact representation, requiring less storage than existing methods for offline
  question answering. Third, symbolic program execution offers full transparency to
  the reasoning process; we are thus able to interpret and diagnose each execution
  step.'
