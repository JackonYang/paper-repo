paperAbstract: This paper describes a statistical model for a document understanding
  system, which uses both text attributes and document layouts. Probabilistic relaxation
  is used as a recognition scheme to find the hierarchical structure of the logical
  layout. This approach, commonly used for pixels classification in image analysis,
  can be applied to classify text blocks into logical classes according to local compatibility
  with other neighboring blocks at different hierarchical levels. It provides a logical
  layout that is globally compatible with the training model. We have tested this
  approach on reading tables of contents of periodicals for documents indexing. Probabilistic
  relaxation has interesting properties like high-speed training and the 'a priori'
  recognition rate, which provides the consistency of the model according to the features
  used, and the samples chosen among the training set.
