paperAbstract: We present a technique for constructing random fields from a set of
  training samples. The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing
  potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs.
  Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
  between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy
  algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative
  scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random
  field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to
  much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are
  non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations
  to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration
  of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification
  in natural language processing.
