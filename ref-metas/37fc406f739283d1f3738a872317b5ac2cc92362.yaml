paperAbstract: The ability to understand natural-language instructions is critical
  to building intelligent agents that interact with humans. We present a system that
  learns to transform natural-language navigation instructions into executable formal
  plans. Given no prior linguistic knowledge, the system learns by simply observing
  how humans follow navigation instructions. The system is evaluated in three complex
  virtual indoor environments with numerous objects and landmarks. A previously collected
  realistic corpus of complex English navigation instructions for these environments
  is used for training and testing data. By using a learned lexicon to refine inferred
  plans and a supervised learner to induce a semantic parser, the system is able to
  automatically learn to correctly interpret a reasonable fraction of the complex
  instructions in this corpus.
