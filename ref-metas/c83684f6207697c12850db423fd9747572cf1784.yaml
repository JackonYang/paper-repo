paperAbstract: 'Connectionist feed-forward networks, t rained with backpropagat ion,
  can be used both for nonlinear regression and for (discrete one-of-C ) classification.
  This paper presents approximate Bayesian meth ods to statistical components of back-propagat
  ion: choosing a cost funct ion and penalty term (interpreted as a form of prior
  probability), pruning insignifican t weights, est imat ing the uncertainty of weights,
  predict ing for new pat terns ("out -of-sample") , est imating the uncertainty in
  the choice of this predict ion ("erro r bars" ), estimating the generalizat ion
  erro r, comparing different network st ructures, and handling missing values in
  the t raining patterns. These methods extend some heurist ic techniques suggested
  in the literature, and in most cases require a small addit ional facto r in comput
  at ion during back-propagat ion, or computation once back-pro pagat ion has finished.'
