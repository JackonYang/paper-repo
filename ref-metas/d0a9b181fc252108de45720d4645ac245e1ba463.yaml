paperAbstract: 'Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to
  reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic
  graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task.
  The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and
  then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically
  from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing
  a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect
  of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which
  make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.
  Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian
  networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions
  to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the
  text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and
  learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book
  considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making
  under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical
  development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material:
  skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical
  cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer
  vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and
  concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the
  chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from
  core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.'
