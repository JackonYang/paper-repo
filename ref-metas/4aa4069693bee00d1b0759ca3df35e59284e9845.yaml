paperAbstract: Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability
  to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to
  the increasing difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data in the form of labeled
  images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data
  from other sources - such as text data - both to train visual models and to constrain
  their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding
  model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as
  semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model
  matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition
  challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the
  semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands
  of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot
  predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never
  seen by the visual model.
