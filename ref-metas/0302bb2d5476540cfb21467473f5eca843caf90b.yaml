paperAbstract: 'Datasets are an integral part of contemporary object recognition research.
  They have been the chief reason for the considerable progress in the field, not
  just as source of large amounts of training data, but also as means of measuring
  and comparing performance of competing algorithms. At the same time, datasets have
  often been blamed for narrowing the focus of object recognition research, reducing
  it to a single benchmark performance number. Indeed, some datasets, that started
  out as data capture efforts aimed at representing the visual world, have become
  closed worlds unto themselves (e.g. the Corel world, the Caltech-101 world, the
  PASCAL VOC world). With the focus on beating the latest benchmark numbers on the
  latest dataset, have we perhaps lost sight of the original purpose? The goal of
  this paper is to take stock of the current state of recognition datasets. We present
  a comparison study using a set of popular datasets, evaluated based on a number
  of criteria including: relative data bias, cross-dataset generalization, effects
  of closed-world assumption, and sample value. The experimental results, some rather
  surprising, suggest directions that can improve dataset collection as well as algorithm
  evaluation protocols. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion in the
  community regarding this very important, but largely neglected issue.'
