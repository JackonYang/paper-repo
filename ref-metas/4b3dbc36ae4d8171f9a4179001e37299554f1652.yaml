paperAbstract: 'The paper makes two contributions: it provides (1) an operational
  definition of textons, the putative elementary units of texture perception, and
  (2) an algorithm for partitioning the image into disjoint regions of coherent brightness
  and texture, where boundaries of regions are defined by peaks in contour orientation
  energy and differences in texton densities across the contour. B. Julesz (1981)
  introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did
  not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons
  as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These
  can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton,
  the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where
  discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms
  of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences
  to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured
  regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy
  derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters.
  Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination
  we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay
  neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to
  belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized
  cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness.
  Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown.'
