paperAbstract: Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision.
  Unfortunately, traditional image registration techniques tend to be costly. We present
  a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient
  of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our
  technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the
  images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be
  generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique
  can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system.
