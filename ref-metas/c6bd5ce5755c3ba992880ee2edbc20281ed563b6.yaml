paperAbstract: Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and
  shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond
  biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the
  linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks.
  The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair
  of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark
  A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the
  span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient
  null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently,
  one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark
  distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between
  shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any
  basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any
  mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied
  to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically
  significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured
  along directions a t an angle averaging 90" in the samples of forms. One size variable
  will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other
  the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration
  of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated
  in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison
  of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal
  grid pair.
