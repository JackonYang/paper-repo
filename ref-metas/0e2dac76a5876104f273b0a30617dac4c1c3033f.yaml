paperAbstract: The paper studies the problem of combining region and boundary cues
  for natural image segmentation. We employ a large database of manually segmented
  images in order to learn an optimal affinity function between pairs of pixels. These
  pairwise affinities can then be used to cluster the pixels into visually coherent
  groups. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness, color, and texture
  between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by looking for the presence
  of an "intervening contour", a large gradient along a straight line connecting two
  pixels. We first use the dataset of human segmentations to individually optimize
  parameters of the patch and gradient features for brightness, color, and texture
  cues. We then quantitatively measure the power of different feature combinations
  by computing the precision and recall of classifiers trained using those features.
  The mutual information between the output of the classifiers and the same-segment
  indicator function provides an alternative evaluation technique that yields identical
  conclusions. As expected, the best classifier makes use of brightness, color, and
  texture features, in both patch and gradient forms. We find that for brightness,
  the gradient cue outperforms the patch similarity. In contrast, using color patch
  similarity yields better results than using color gradients. Texture is the most
  powerful of the three channels, with both patches and gradients carrying significant
  independent information. Interestingly, the proximity of the two pixels does not
  add any information beyond that provided by the similarity cues. We also find that
  the convexity assumptions made by the intervening contour approach are supported
  by the ecological statistics of the dataset.
