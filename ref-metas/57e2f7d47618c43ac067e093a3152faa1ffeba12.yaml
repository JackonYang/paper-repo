paperAbstract: We present a fast method for finding horizontal lines in run length
  encoded images. The method was motivated by the need for quick and reliable detection
  of horizontal lines in an interactive drawing conversion system for telephone company
  drawings. At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths,
  assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the
  gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method
  is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping,
  both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many
  false positive lines.
