paperAbstract: "The problem of tracking curves in dense visual clutter is a challenging\
  \ one. Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based\
  \ on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative\
  \ hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations\
  \ work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally\
  \ to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation\
  \ algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored\
  \ sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images,\
  \ in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly\
  \ generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored\
  \ sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution\
  \ for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking\
  \ of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable\
  \ from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm\
  \ runs in near real-time."
