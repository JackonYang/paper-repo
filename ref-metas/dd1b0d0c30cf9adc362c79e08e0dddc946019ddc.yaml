paperAbstract: Table detection can be a valuable step in the analysis of unstructured
  documents. Although much work has been conducted in the domain of machine-print
  including books, scientific papers, etc., little has been done to address the case
  of handwritten inputs. In this paper, we study table detection in scanned handwritten
  documents subject to challenging artifacts and noise. First, we separate text components
  (machine-print, handwriting) from the rest of the page using an SVM classifier.
  We then employ a correlation-based approach to measure the coherence between adjacent
  text lines which may be part of the same table, solving the resulting page decomposition
  problem using dynamic programming. A report of preliminary results from ongoing
  experiments concludes the paper.
