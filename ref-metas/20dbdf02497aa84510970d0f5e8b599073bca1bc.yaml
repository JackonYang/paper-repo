paperAbstract: We propose a method for visual question answering which combines an
  internal representation of the content of an image with information extracted from
  a general knowledge base to answer a broad range of image-based questions. This
  allows more complex questions to be answered using the predominant neural network-based
  approach than has previously been possible. It particularly allows questions to
  be asked about the contents of an image, even when the image itself does not contain
  the whole answer. The method constructs a textual representation of the semantic
  content of an image, and merges it with textual information sourced from a knowledge
  base, to develop a deeper understanding of the scene viewed. Priming a recurrent
  neural network with this combined information, and the submitted question, leads
  to a very flexible visual question answering approach. We are specifically able
  to answer questions posed in natural language, that refer to information not contained
  in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two publicly available
  datasets, Toronto COCO-QA [23] and VQA [1] and show that it produces the best reported
  results in both cases.
