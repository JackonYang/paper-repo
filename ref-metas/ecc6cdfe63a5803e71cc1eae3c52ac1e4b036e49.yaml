paperAbstract: An interesting subclass of bandpass signals {h} is described wherein
  the zero crossings of h determine h within a multiplicative constant. The members
  may have complex zeros, but it is necessary that h should have no zeros in common
  with its Hilbert transform h other than real simple zeros. It is then sufficient
  that the band be less than an octave in width. The subclass is shown to include
  full-carrier upper-sideband signals (of less than an octave bandwidth). Also it
  is shown that full-carrier lower-sideband signals have only real simple zeros (for
  any ratio of upper and tower frequencies) and, hence, are readily identified by
  their zero crossings. However, under the most general conditions for uniqueness,
  the problem of actually recovering h from its sign changes appears to be very difficult
  and impractical.
