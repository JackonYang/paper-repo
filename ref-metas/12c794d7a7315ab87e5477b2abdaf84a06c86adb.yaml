paperAbstract: This paper develops new image matching techniques for visual servoing
  based on affine invariants which allow one to deal with large viewpoint changes
  and that do not rely on specific markers. The only assumption is that there are
  some locally planar and unoccluded scene regions that have enough structure to be
  detected in the image. Those regions are classified by a set of illumination and
  viewpoint invariant features. The features represent the image in a very compact
  way and allow fast comparison and feature matching between quite different viewpoints.
  The matching procedure is embedded in a visual servoing system for a mobile robot.
  Experiments show its potential for navigation with large camera rotations and view
  point changes in a cluttered environment without the need for artificial landmarks.
