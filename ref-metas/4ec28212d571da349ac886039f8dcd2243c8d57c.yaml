paperAbstract: We present a new image segmentation algorithm based on graph cuts.
  Our main tool is separation of each pixel p from a special point outside the image
  by a cut of a minimum cost. Such a cut creates a group of pixels C/sub p/ around
  each pixel. We show that these groups C/sub p/ are either disjoint or nested in
  each other and so they give a natural segmentation of the image. In addition this
  property allows an efficient implementation of the algorithms because for most pixels
  p the computation of C/sub p/ is not performed on the whole graph. We inspect all
  C/sub p/ and discard those which are not interesting, for example if they are too
  small. This procedure automatically groups small components together or merges them
  into nearby large clusters. Effectively, our segmentation is performed by extracting
  significant non-intersecting closed contours. We present interesting segmentation
  results on real and artificial images.
