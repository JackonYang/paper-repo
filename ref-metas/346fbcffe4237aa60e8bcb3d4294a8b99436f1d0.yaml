paperAbstract: The Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) is a recently proposed
  model for time series that has a rich, distributed hidden state and permits simple,
  exact inference. We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most
  important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions
  that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by
  the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied
  by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2).
  The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by
  modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion
  with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve
  the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.
