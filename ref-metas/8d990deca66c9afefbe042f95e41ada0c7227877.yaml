paperAbstract: Abstract Stochastic substitution, the Gibbs sampler, and the sampling-importance-resampling
  algorithm can be viewed as three alternative sampling- (or Monte Carlo-) based approaches
  to the calculation of numerical estimates of marginal probability distributions.
  The three approaches will be reviewed, compared, and contrasted in relation to various
  joint probability structures frequently encountered in applications. In particular,
  the relevance of the approaches to calculating Bayesian posterior densities for
  a variety of structured models will be discussed and illustrated.
