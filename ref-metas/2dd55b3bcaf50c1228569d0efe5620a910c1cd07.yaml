paperAbstract: We present a generic objectness measure, quantifying how likely it
  is for an image window to contain an object of any class. We explicitly train it
  to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones,
  from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines
  in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects,
  such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary.
  This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In
  experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform
  a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better
  than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according
  to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location
  priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC
  07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific
  object detectors.
