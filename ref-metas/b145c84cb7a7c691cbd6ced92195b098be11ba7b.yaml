paperAbstract: To escape from the curse of dimensionality, we claim that one can learn
  non-local functions, in the sense that the value and shape of the learned function
  at x must be inferred using examples that may be far from x. With this objective,
  we present a non-local non-parametric density estimator. It builds upon previously
  proposed Gaussian mixture models with regularized covariance matrices to take into
  account the local shape of the manifold. It also builds upon recent work on non-local
  estimators of the tangent plane of a manifold, which are able to generalize in places
  with little training data, unlike traditional, local, non-parametric models.
