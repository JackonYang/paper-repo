paperAbstract: Human detection has witnessed impressive progress in recent years.
  However, the occlusion issue of detecting human in highly crowded environments is
  far from solved. To make matters worse, crowd scenarios are still under-represented
  in current human detection benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset,
  called CrowdHuman, to better evaluate detectors in crowd scenarios. The CrowdHuman
  dataset is large, rich-annotated and contains high diversity. There are a total
  of $470K$ human instances from the train and validation subsets, and $~22.6$ persons
  per image, with various kinds of occlusions in the dataset. Each human instance
  is annotated with a head bounding-box, human visible-region bounding-box and human
  full-body bounding-box. Baseline performance of state-of-the-art detection frameworks
  on CrowdHuman is presented. The cross-dataset generalization results of CrowdHuman
  dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on previous dataset including Caltech-USA,
  CityPersons, and Brainwash without bells and whistles. We hope our dataset will
  serve as a solid baseline and help promote future research in human detection tasks.
