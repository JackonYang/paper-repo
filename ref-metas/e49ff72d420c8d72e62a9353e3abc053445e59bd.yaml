paperAbstract: "Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional\
  \ Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and\
  \ video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that\
  \ allows expressing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions.\
  \ However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic\
  \ data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities. \nIn\
  \ this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architectures\
  \ with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically\
  \ unknown and need to be estimated from the data. In particular, we develop an extension\
  \ of Spectral Networks which incorporates a Graph Estimation procedure, that we\
  \ test on large-scale classification problems, matching or improving over Dropout\
  \ Networks with far less parameters to estimate."
