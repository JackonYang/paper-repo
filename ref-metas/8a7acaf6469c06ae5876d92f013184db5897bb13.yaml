paperAbstract: It is shown how a system consisting of two neuronlike adaptive elements
  can solve a difficult learning control problem. The task is to balance a pole that
  is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued
  that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive
  networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem.
  The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a
  single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole,
  the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the
  influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation
  function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide. The differences between
  this approach and other attempts to solve problems using neurolike elements are
  discussed, as is the relation of this work to classical and instrumental conditioning
  in animal learning studies and its possible implications for research in the neurosciences.
