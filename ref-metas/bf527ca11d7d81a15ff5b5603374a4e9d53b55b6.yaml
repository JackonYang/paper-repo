paperAbstract: "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition\
  \ has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique\
  \ that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously\
  \ possible. This method, \u201CExpectation Propagation,\u201D unifies and generalizes\
  \ two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman\
  \ filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian\
  \ networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as\
  \ approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which\
  \ is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best\
  \ of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy\
  \ of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates\
  \ exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely\
  \ discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with\
  \ expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation\
  \ Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating\
  \ richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis\
  \ framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and\
  \ real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found,\
  \ for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation\
  \ techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern\
  \ recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes\
  \ Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously\
  \ known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several\
  \ standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation\
  \ Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification,\
  \ via Bayesian model selection. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries,\
