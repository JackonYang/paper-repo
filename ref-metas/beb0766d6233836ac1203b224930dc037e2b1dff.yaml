paperAbstract: For many large undirected models that arise in real-world applications,
  exact maximum-likelihood training is intractable, because it requires computing
  marginal distributions of the model. Conditional training is even more difficult,
  because the partition function depends not only on the parameters, but also on the
  observed input, requiring repeated inference over each training example. An appealing
  idea for such models is to independently train a local undirected classifier over
  each clique, afterwards combining the learned weights into a single global model.
  In this paper, we show that this piecewise method can be justified as minimizing
  a new family of upper bounds on the log partition function. On three natural-language
  data sets, piecewise training is more accurate than pseudolikelihood, and often
  performs comparably to global training using belief propagation.
