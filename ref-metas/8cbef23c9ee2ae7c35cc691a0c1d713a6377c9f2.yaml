paperAbstract: This paper builds off recent work from Kiperwasser & Goldberg (2016)
  using neural attention in a simple graph-based dependency parser. We use a larger
  but more thoroughly regularized parser than other recent BiLSTM-based approaches,
  with biaffine classifiers to predict arcs and labels. Our parser gets state of the
  art or near state of the art performance on standard treebanks for six different
  languages, achieving 95.7% UAS and 94.1% LAS on the most popular English PTB dataset.
  This makes it the highest-performing graph-based parser on this benchmark---outperforming
  Kiperwasser Goldberg (2016) by 1.8% and 2.2%---and comparable to the highest performing
  transition-based parser (Kuncoro et al., 2016), which achieves 95.8% UAS and 94.6%
  LAS. We also show which hyperparameter choices had a significant effect on parsing
  accuracy, allowing us to achieve large gains over other graph-based approaches.
