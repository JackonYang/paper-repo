paperAbstract: Research is beginning to uncover fundamental computational principles
  underlying vision that apply equally to artificial and natural systems. These principles
  provide insights into the limitations of early machine vision systems and lay a
  foundation for building future systems capable of high performance in a broad range
  of visual domains. We present this emerging computational view of visual perception,
  discuss some early work in the field in its context, and put forward current thoughts
  on the overall organization and operation of a general-purpose computer vision system,
  synthesizing recent theoretical and experimental results.
