paperAbstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed, useful
  extension of standard principal component analysis (PCA). The ICA model is utilized
  mainly in blind separation of unknown source signals from their linear mixtures.
  In this application only the source signals which correspond to the coefficients
  of the ICA expansion are of interest. In this paper, we propose neural structures
  related to multilayer feedforward networks for performing complete ICA. The basic
  ICA network consists of whitening, separation, and basis vector estimation layers.
  It can be used for both blind source separation and estimation of the basis vectors
  of ICA. We consider learning algorithms for each layer, and modify our previous
  nonlinear PCA type algorithms so that their separation capabilities are greatly
  improved. The proposed class of networks yields good results in test examples with
  both artificial and real-world data.
