paperAbstract: Human actions capture a wide variety of interactions between people
  and objects. As a result, the set of possible actions is extremely large and it
  is difficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all actions. However, we
  could compensate for this sparsity in supervision by leveraging the rich semantic
  relationship between different actions. A single action is often composed of other
  smaller actions and is exclusive of certain others. We need a method which can reason
  about such relationships and extrapolate unobserved actions from known actions.
  Hence, we propose a novel neural network framework which jointly extracts the relationship
  between actions and uses them for training better action retrieval models. Our model
  incorporates linguistic, visual and logical consistency based cues to effectively
  identify these relationships. We train and test our model on a largescale image
  dataset of human actions. We show a significant improvement in mean AP compared
  to different baseline methods including the HEX-graph approach from Deng et al.
