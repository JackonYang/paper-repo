paperAbstract: A wide range of low level vision problems have been formulated in terms
  of finding the most probable assignment of a Markov random field (or equivalently
  the lowest energy configuration). Perhaps the most successful example is stereo
  vision. For the stereo problem, it has been shown that finding the global optimum
  is NP hard but good results have been obtained using a number of approximate optimization
  algorithms. In this paper, we show that for standard benchmark stereo pairs, the
  global optimum can be found in about 30 minutes using a variant of the belief propagation
  (BP) algorithm. We extend previous theoretical results on reweighted belief propagation
  to account for possible ties in the beliefs and using these results we obtain easily
  checkable conditions that guarantee that the BP disparities are the global optima.
  We verify experimentally that these conditions are typically met for the standard
  benchmark stereo pairs and discuss the implications of our results for further progress
  in stereo.
