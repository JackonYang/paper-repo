paperAbstract: Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny
  colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised
  training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this
  have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to
  train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features
  which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization
  algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network,
  we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic
  aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which
  makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of
  reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the
  CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these
  labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training
  a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.
