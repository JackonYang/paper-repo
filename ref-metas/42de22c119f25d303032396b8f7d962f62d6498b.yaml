paperAbstract: We consider the problem of detecting a large number of different object
  classes in cluttered scenes. Traditional approaches require applying a battery of
  different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training
  data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces
  both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can
  be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly,
  rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features
  required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes.
  In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers
  are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained
  classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges.
