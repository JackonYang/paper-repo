paperAbstract: The authors present a computational model that builds a holographic
  lexicon representing both word meaning and word order from unsupervised experience
  with natural language. The model uses simple convolution and superposition mechanisms
  (cf. B. B. Murdock, 1982) to learn distributed holographic representations for words.
  The structure of the resulting lexicon can account for empirical data from classic
  experiments studying semantic typicality, categorization, priming, and semantic
  constraint in sentence completions. Furthermore, order information can be retrieved
  from the holographic representations, allowing the model to account for limited
  word transitions without the need for built-in transition rules. The model demonstrates
  that a broad range of psychological data can be accounted for directly from the
  structure of lexical representations learned in this way, without the need for complexity
  to be built into either the processing mechanisms or the representations. The holographic
  representations are an appropriate knowledge representation to be used by higher
  order models of language comprehension, relieving the complexity required at the
  higher level.
