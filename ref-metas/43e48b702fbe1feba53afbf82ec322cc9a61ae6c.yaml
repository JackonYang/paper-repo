paperAbstract: The appearance of surfaces in real-world scenes is determined by the
  materials, textures, and context in which the surfaces appear. However, the datasets
  we have for visualizing and modeling rich surface appearance in context, in applications
  such as home remodeling, are quite limited. To help address this need, we present
  OpenSurfaces, a rich, labeled database consisting of thousands of examples of surfaces
  segmented from consumer photographs of interiors, and annotated with material parameters
  (reflectance, material names), texture information (surface normals, rectified textures),
  and contextual information (scene category, and object names). Retrieving usable
  surface information from uncalibrated Internet photo collections is challenging.
  We use human annotations and present a new methodology for segmenting and annotating
  materials in Internet photo collections suitable for crowdsourcing (e.g., through
  Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Because of the noise and variability inherent in Internet
  photos and novice annotators, designing this annotation engine was a key challenge;
  we present a multi-stage set of annotation tasks with quality checks and validation.
  We demonstrate the use of this database in proof-of-concept applications including
  surface retexturing and material and image browsing, and discuss future uses. OpenSurfaces
  is a public resource available at http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/.
