paperAbstract: Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in
  several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing,
  and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
  currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks
  such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so
  far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic
  signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric
  deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured
  data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains
  of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this
  paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to
  non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional
  task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously
  proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework.
  We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and
  3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.
