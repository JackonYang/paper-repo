paperAbstract: Unsupervised methods for learning distributed representations of words
  are ubiquitous in today's NLP research, but far less is known about the best ways
  to learn distributed phrase or sentence representations from unlabelled data. This
  paper is a systematic comparison of models that learn such representations. We find
  that the optimal approach depends critically on the intended application. Deeper,
  more complex models are preferable for representations to be used in supervised
  systems, but shallow log-linear models work best for building representation spaces
  that can be decoded with simple spatial distance metrics. We also propose two new
  unsupervised representation-learning objectives designed to optimise the trade-off
  between training time, domain portability and performance.
