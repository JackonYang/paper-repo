paperAbstract: This paper describes a natural language parsing algorithm for unrestricted
  text which uses a probability-based scoring function to select the "best" parse
  of a sentence. The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser
  with Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory in
  the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the context
  of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from previous
  attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional probabilities
  based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also provides a framework for incorporating
  the results of previous work in part-of-speech assignment, unknown word models,
  and other probabilistic models of linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving
  these techniques instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary
  tests, Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech
  processing) ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting correct
  parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar.
