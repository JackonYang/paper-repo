paperAbstract: 'Despite a recent push towards large-scale object recognition, activity
  recognition remains limited to narrow domains and small vocabularies of actions.
  In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities
  ``in-the-wild''''. We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs
  a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor,
  the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain
  actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot
  find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer
  that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies
  learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization,
  and priors learned from Web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely
  combinations of actors/actions/objects, we also use a Web-scale language model to
  ``fill in'''' novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set.
  We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate
  short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches.'
