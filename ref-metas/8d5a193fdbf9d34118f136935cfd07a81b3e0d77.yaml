paperAbstract: Deterministic approximations to Markov random field (MRF) models are
  derived. One of the models is shown to give in a natural way the graduated nonconvexity
  (GNC) algorithm proposed by A. Blake and A. Zisserman (1987). This model can be
  applied to smooth a field preserving its discontinuities. A class of more complex
  models is then proposed in order to deal with a variety of vision problems. All
  the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of statistical mechanics and
  mean field techniques. A parallel, iterative algorithm to solve the deterministic
  equations of the two models is presented, together with some experiments on synthetic
  and real images. >
