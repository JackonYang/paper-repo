paperAbstract: 'Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for finding succinct
  representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis
  functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, finding sparse
  codes remains a very difficult computational problem. In this paper, we present
  efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex
  optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained
  least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization
  problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing
  us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms.
  We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse
  codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression
  and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1
  neurons.'
