paperAbstract: We present a new approach to model visual scenes in image collections,
  based on local invariant features and probabilistic latent space models. Our formulation
  provides answers to three open questions:(l) whether the invariant local features
  are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupennsed
  latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task;
  and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns,
  motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image
  dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with
  extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that
  a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently
  outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Second, we show that probabilistic latent
  semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative
  for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data
  are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract
  visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking
  and context-sensitive image segmentation.
