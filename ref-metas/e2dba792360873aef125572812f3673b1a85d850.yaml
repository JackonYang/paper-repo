paperAbstract: Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora
  are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn
  such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector
  to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies
  and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram
  model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation
  is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these
  representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly
  and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the
  training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages,
  both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological
  word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance
  on these tasks.
