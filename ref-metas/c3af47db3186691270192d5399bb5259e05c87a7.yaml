paperAbstract: Convolutional Neural Networks spread through computer vision like a
  wildfire, impacting almost all visual tasks imaginable. Despite this, few researchers
  dare to train their models from scratch. Most work builds on one of a handful of
  ImageNet pre-trained models, and fine-tunes or adapts these for specific tasks.
  This is in large part due to the difficulty of properly initializing these networks
  from scratch. A small miscalibration of the initial weights leads to vanishing or
  exploding gradients, as well as poor convergence properties. In this work we present
  a fast and simple data-dependent initialization procedure, that sets the weights
  of a network such that all units in the network train at roughly the same rate,
  avoiding vanishing or exploding gradients. Our initialization matches the current
  state-of-the-art unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training methods on standard
  computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, while
  being roughly three orders of magnitude faster. When combined with pre-training
  methods, our initialization significantly outperforms prior work, narrowing the
  gap between supervised and unsupervised pre-training.
