paperAbstract: This is a dictionary of English as it is actually used and is also
  written and presented in plain English. By presenting the patterns of spoken or
  plain English in a new format, it enables easier and earlier use of a monolingual
  dictionary. This dictionary is suitable for all learners of English from intermediate
  to advanced level. There are over 70,000 references and over 90,000 examples, taken
  from books, magazines and newspapers. The wordlist is up-to-date and gives detailed
  treatment to the most frequently used words in English. All senses are explained
  in clear, natural English, using carefully chosen vocabulary to ensure that each
  meaning can be easily understood. Each spelling of a word is given in full to ensure
  clarity and essential grammar is contained in the wording of each definition. Synonyms
  and antonyms are given, as well as guidance on pronunciation using the International
  Phonetic Alphabet.
