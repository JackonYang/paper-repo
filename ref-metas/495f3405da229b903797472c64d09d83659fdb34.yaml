paperAbstract: WordNet::Similarity is a freely available software package that makes
  it possible to measure the semantic similarity and relatedness between a pair of
  concepts (or synsets). It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures
  of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet. These measures
  are implemented as Perl modules which take as input two concepts, and return a numeric
  value that represents the degree to which they are similar or related.
