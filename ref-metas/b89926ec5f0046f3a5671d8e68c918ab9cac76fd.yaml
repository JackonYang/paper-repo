paperAbstract: Although there has been significant previous work on semi-supervised
  learning for classification, there has been relatively little in sequence modeling.
  This paper presents an approach that leverages recent work in manifold-learning
  on sequences to discover word clusters from language data, including both syntactic
  classes and semantic topics. From unlabeled data we form a smooth. low-dimensional
  feature space, where each word token is projected based on its underlying role as
  a function or content word. We then use this projection as additional input features
  to a linear-chain conditional random field trained on limited labeled training data.
  On standard part-of-speech tagging and Chinese word segmentation data sets we show
  as much as 14% error reduction due to the unlabeled data, and also statistically-significant
  improvements over a related semi-supervised sequence tagging method due to Miller
  et al.
