paperAbstract: 'This paper proposes a face recognition system, based on probabilistic
  decision-based neural networks (PDBNN). With technological advance on microelectronic
  and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition
  are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods,
  face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential
  to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists
  of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an
  image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate
  meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes,
  and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module
  is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules.
  It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a
  competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application
  of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one
  in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three
  different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and
  false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition
  process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and
  classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware
  accelerator or co-processor.'
