paperAbstract: Sequences have become first class citizens in supervised learning thanks
  to the resurgence of recurrent neural networks. Many complex tasks that require
  mapping from or to a sequence of observations can now be formulated with the sequence-to-sequence
  (seq2seq) framework which employs the chain rule to efficiently represent the joint
  probability of sequences. In many cases, however, variable sized inputs and/or outputs
  might not be naturally expressed as sequences. For instance, it is not clear how
  to input a set of numbers into a model where the task is to sort them; similarly,
  we do not know how to organize outputs when they correspond to random variables
  and the task is to model their unknown joint probability. In this paper, we first
  show using various examples that the order in which we organize input and/or output
  data matters significantly when learning an underlying model. We then discuss an
  extension of the seq2seq framework that goes beyond sequences and handles input
  sets in a principled way. In addition, we propose a loss which, by searching over
  possible orders during training, deals with the lack of structure of output sets.
  We show empirical evidence of our claims regarding ordering, and on the modifications
  to the seq2seq framework on benchmark language modeling and parsing tasks, as well
  as two artificial tasks -- sorting numbers and estimating the joint probability
  of unknown graphical models.
