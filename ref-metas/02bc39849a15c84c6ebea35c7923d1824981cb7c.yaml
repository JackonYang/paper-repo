paperAbstract: We present a family of scale-invariant local shape features formed
  by chains of k connected roughly straight contour segments (kAS), and their use
  for object class detection. kAS are able to cleanly encode pure fragments of an
  object boundary without including nearby clutter. Moreover, they offer an attractive
  compromise between information content and repeatability and encompass a wide variety
  of local shape structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor
  encoding the geometric configuration of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy
  to reuse in other frameworks, for example, as a replacement or addition to interest
  points (IPs). Software for detecting and describing kAS is released at http://lear.inrialpes.fr/software.
  We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful sliding-window
  object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse
  object classes and more than 1,400 images, we (1) study the evolution of performance
  as the degree of feature complexity k varies and determine the best degree, (2)
  show that kAS substantially outperform IPs for detecting shape-based classes, and
  (3) compare our object detector to the recent state-of-the-art system by Dalal and
  Triggs (2005).
