paperAbstract: 'The extrema in a signal and its first few derivatives provide a useful
  general purpose qualitative description for many kinds of signals. A fundamental
  problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over
  some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size.
  Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing
  the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded
  by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This "scale-space"
  image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing
  a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation.
  The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify
  events that persist of large changes in scale.'
