paperAbstract: Standard accuracy metrics indicate that reading comprehension systems
  are making rapid progress, but the extent to which these systems truly understand
  language remains unclear. To reward systems with real language understanding abilities,
  we propose an adversarial evaluation scheme for the Stanford Question Answering
  Dataset (SQuAD). Our method tests whether systems can answer questions about paragraphs
  that contain adversarially inserted sentences, which are automatically generated
  to distract computer systems without changing the correct answer or misleading humans.
  In this adversarial setting, the accuracy of sixteen published models drops from
  an average of 75% F1 score to 36%; when the adversary is allowed to add ungrammatical
  sequences of words, average accuracy on four models decreases further to 7%. We
  hope our insights will motivate the development of new models that understand language
  more precisely.
