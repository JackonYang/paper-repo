paperAbstract: "We investigate to what extent \u2018bag of visual words\u2019 models\
  \ can be used to distinguish categories which have significant visual similarity.\
  \ To this end we develop and optimize a nearest neighbour classifier architecture,\
  \ which is evaluated on a very challenging database of flower images. The flower\
  \ categories are chosen to be indistinguishable on colour alone (for example), and\
  \ have considerable variation in shape, scale, and viewpoint. We demonstrate that\
  \ by developing a visual vocabulary that explicitly represents the various aspects\
  \ (colour, shape, and texture) that distinguish one flower from another, we can\
  \ overcome the ambiguities that exist between flower categories. The novelty lies\
  \ in the vocabulary used for each aspect, and how these vocabularies are combined\
  \ into a final classifier. The various stages of the classifier (vocabulary selection\
  \ and combination) are each optimized on a validation set. Results are presented\
  \ on a dataset of 1360 images consisting of 17 flower species. It is shown that\
  \ excellent performance can be achieved, far surpassing standard baseline algorithms\
  \ using (for example) colour cues alone."
