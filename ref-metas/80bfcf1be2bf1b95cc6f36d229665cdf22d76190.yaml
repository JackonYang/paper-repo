paperAbstract: We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance
  videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features
  computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of
  deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently
  limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for
  action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal
  dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information
  encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels
  of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines
  information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing
  the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety
  of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in
  the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior
  performance in comparison to baseline methods.
