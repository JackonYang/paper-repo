paperAbstract: We are interested in large-scale image classification and especially
  in the setting where images corresponding to new or existing classes are continuously
  added to the training set. Our goal is to devise classifiers which can incorporate
  such images and classes on-the-fly at (near) zero cost. We cast this problem into
  one of learning a metric which is shared across all classes and explore k-nearest
  neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. We learn metrics on the
  ImageNet 2010 challenge data set, which contains more than 1.2M training images
  of 1K classes. Surprisingly, the NCM classifier compares favorably to the more flexible
  k-NN classifier, and has comparable performance to linear SVMs. We also study the
  generalization performance, among others by using the learned metric on the ImageNet-10K
  dataset, and we obtain competitive performance. Finally, we explore zero-shot classification,
  and show how the zero-shot model can be combined very effectively with small training
  datasets.
