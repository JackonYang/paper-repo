paperAbstract: Automatically describing an image with a natural language has been
  an emerging challenge in both fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
  In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Attributes (LSTM-A) - a novel
  architecture that integrates attributes into the successful Convolutional Neural
  Networks (CNNs) plus Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) image captioning framework,
  by training them in an end-to-end manner. Particularly, the learning of attributes
  is strengthened by integrating inter-attribute correlations into Multiple Instance
  Learning (MIL). To incorporate attributes into captioning, we construct variants
  of architectures by feeding image representations and attributes into RNNs in different
  ways to explore the mutual but also fuzzy relationship between them. Extensive experiments
  are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset and our framework shows clear improvements
  when compared to state-of-the-art deep models. More remarkably, we obtain METEOR/CIDEr-D
  of 25.5%/100.2% on testing data of widely used and publicly available splits in
  [10] when extracting image representations by GoogleNet and achieve superior performance
  on COCO captioning Leaderboard.
