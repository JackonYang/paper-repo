paperAbstract: An article of golfing equipment has a golf tee attached to a spring-biassed
  reel by a length of string. The reel is mounted in a casing which receives the tee
  when the spring rotates the reel to wind the spring onto it. The reel is normally
  locked by a one-way ratchet but is released to wind in the string by a push-button
  which has a spike and is detachable from the casing so as to be usable as a ball
  marker. When practising, the cord can be aligned with the green or hole and used
  as an aid in swinging the club face in the correct direction. The casing has a spring-clip
  so that the article can be clipped into the golfer's pocker when he is not using
  it.
