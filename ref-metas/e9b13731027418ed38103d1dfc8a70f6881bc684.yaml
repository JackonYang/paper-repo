paperAbstract: Learning effective fusion of multi-modality features is at the heart
  of visual question answering. We propose a novel method of dynamically fuse multi-modal
  features with intra- and inter-modality information flow, which alternatively pass
  dynamic information between and across the visual and language modalities. It can
  robustly capture the high-level interactions between language and vision domains,
  thus significantly improves the performance of visual question answering. We also
  show that, the proposed dynamic intra modality attention flow conditioned on the
  other modality can dynamically modulate the intra-modality attention of the current
  modality, which is vital for multimodality feature fusion. Experimental evaluations
  on the VQA 2.0 dataset show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art
  VQA performance. Extensive ablation studies are carried out for the comprehensive
  analysis of the proposed method.
