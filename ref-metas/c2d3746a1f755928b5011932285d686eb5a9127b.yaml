paperAbstract: Some of the most effective recent methods for content-based image classification
  work by extracting dense or sparse local image descriptors, quantizing them according
  to a coding rule such as k-means vector quantization, accumulating histograms of
  the resulting "visual word" codes over the image, and classifying these with a conventional
  classifier such as an SVM. Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are
  needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely
  Randomized Clustering Forests - ensembles of randomly created clustering trees -
  and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing
  and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classification
  tasks.
