paperAbstract: We describe an efficient learning procedure for multilayer generative
  models that combine the best aspects of Markov random fields and deep, directed
  belief nets. The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning
  is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation
  to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has
  its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections
  from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle
  to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good
  at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images.
