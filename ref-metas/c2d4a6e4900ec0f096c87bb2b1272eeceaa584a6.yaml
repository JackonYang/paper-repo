paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new interactive system: a game that is fun and can
  be used to create valuable output. When people play the game they help determine
  the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played
  as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be
  labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the
  Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites
  (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help
  users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because
  of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem.
  Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don''t work well enough, we
  encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained.'
