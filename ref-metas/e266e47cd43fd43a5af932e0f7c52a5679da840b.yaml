paperAbstract: We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic
  graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals
  are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation,
  we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated
  in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free
  energy and the naive mean-field free as special cases. Using the linear response
  correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation
  results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.
