paperAbstract: A wealth of on-line text information can be made available to automatic
  processing by information extraction (IE) systems. Each IE application needs a separate
  set of rules tuned to the domain and writing style. WHISK helps to overcome this
  knowledge-engineering bottleneck by learning text extraction rules automatically.WHISK
  is designed to handle text styles ranging from highly structured to free text, including
  text that is neither rigidly formatted nor composed of grammatical sentences. Such
  semi-structured text has largely been beyond the scope of previous systems. When
  used in conjunction with a syntactic analyzer and semantic tagging, WHISK can also
  handle extraction from free text such as news stories.
