paperAbstract: We propose to study the problem of few-shot learning with the prism
  of inference on a partially observed graphical model, constructed from a collection
  of input images whose label can be either observed or not. By assimilating generic
  message-passing inference algorithms with their neural-network counterparts, we
  define a graph neural network architecture that generalizes several of the recently
  proposed few-shot learning models. Besides providing improved numerical performance,
  our framework is easily extended to variants of few-shot learning, such as semi-supervised
  or active learning, demonstrating the ability of graph-based models to operate well
  on 'relational' tasks.
