paperAbstract: 'Most state-of-the-art approaches for named-entity recognition (NER)
  use semi supervised information in the form of word clusters and lexicons. Recently
  neural network-based language models have been explored, as they as a byproduct
  generate highly informative vector representations for words, known as word embeddings.
  In this paper we present two contributions: a new form of learning word embeddings
  that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve the representations,
  and the first system to use neural word embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art results
  on named-entity recognition in both CoNLL and Ontonotes NER. Our system achieves
  an F1 score of 90.90 on the test set for CoNLL 2003---significantly better than
  any previous system trained on public data, and matching a system employing massive
  private industrial query-log data.'
