paperAbstract: This paper analyzes the elastic net approach (Durbin and Willshaw 1987)
  to the traveling salesman problem of finding the shortest path through a set of
  cities. The elastic net approach jointly minimizes the length of an arbitrary path
  in the plane and the distance between the path points and the cities. The tradeoff
  between these two requirements is controlled by a scale parameter K. A global minimum
  is found for large K, and is then tracked to a small value. In this paper, we show
  that (1) in the small K limit the elastic path passes arbitrarily close to all the
  cities, but that only one path point is attracted to each city, (2) in the large
  K limit the net lies at the center of the set of cities, and (3) at a critical value
  of K the energy function bifurcates. We also show that this method can be interpreted
  in terms of extremizing a probability distribution controlled by K. The minimum
  at a given K corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimate of
  the tour under a natural statistical interpretation. The analysis presented in this
  paper gives us a better understanding of the behavior of the elastic net, allows
  us to better choose the parameters for the optimization, and suggests how to extend
  the underlying ideas to other domains.
