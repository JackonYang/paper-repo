paperAbstract: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden
  in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised
  machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing
  the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have
  certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based
  on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation.
  We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and
  compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically,
  namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare
  and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction
  error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method
  by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset
  of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines
  and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed
  variables can be captured.
