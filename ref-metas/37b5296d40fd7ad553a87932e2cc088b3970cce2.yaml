paperAbstract: Typographic and visual information is an integral part of textual documents.
  Most information extraction (IE) systems ignore most of this visual information,
  processing the text as a linear sequence of words. Thus, much valuable information
  is lost. In this paper, we show how to make use of this visual information for IE.
  We present an algorithm that allows to automatically extract specific fields of
  the document (such as the title, author, etc.) based exclusively on the visual formatting
  of the document, without any reference to the semantic content. The algorithm employs
  a machine learning approach, whereby the system is first provided with a set of
  training documents in which the target fields are manually tagged and automatically
  learns how to extract these fields in future documents. We implemented the algorithm
  in a system for automatic analysis of documents in PDF format. We present experimental
  results of applying the system on a set of financial documents, extracting nine
  different target fields. Overall, the system achieved a 90% accuracy.
