paperAbstract: "The paper is concerned with the \u2018primal\u2019 problem of maximizing\
  \ a given quadratic pseudo-boolean function. Four equivalent problems are discussed\u2014\
  the primal, the \u2018complementation\u2019, the \u2018discrete Rhys LP\u2019 and\
  \ the \u2018weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. Each of them has a\
  \ relaxation\u2014the \u2018roof dual\u2019, the \u2018quadratic complementation,\u2019\
  \ the \u2018continuous Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018fractional weighted stability\
  \ problem of a SAM graph\u2019. The main result is that the four gaps associated\
  \ with the four relaxations are equal. Furthermore, a solution to any of these problems\
  \ leads at once to solutions of the other three equivalent ones. The four relaxations\
  \ can be solved in polynomial time by transforming them to a bipartite maximum flow\
  \ problem. The optimal solutions of the \u2018roof-dual\u2019 define \u2018best\u2019\
  \ linear majorantsp(x) off, having the following persistency property: if theith\
  \ coefficient inp is positive (negative) thenxi=1 (0) in every optimum of the primal\
  \ problem. Several characterizations are given for the case where these persistency\
  \ results cannot be used to fix any variable of the primal. On the other hand, a\
  \ class of gap-free functions (properly including the supermodular ones) is exhibited."
