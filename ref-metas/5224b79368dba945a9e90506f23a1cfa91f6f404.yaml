paperAbstract: 'Pedestrian detection is a rapidly evolving area in computer vision
  with key applications in intelligent vehicles, surveillance, and advanced robotics.
  The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of the
  art from both methodological and experimental perspectives. The first part of the
  paper consists of a survey. We cover the main components of a pedestrian detection
  system and the underlying models. The second (and larger) part of the paper contains
  a corresponding experimental study. We consider a diverse set of state-of-the-art
  systems: wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade, HOG/linSVM, NN/LRF, and combined shape-texture
  detection. Experiments are performed on an extensive data set captured onboard a
  vehicle driving through urban environment. The data set includes many thousands
  of training samples as well as a 27-minute test sequence involving more than 20,000
  images with annotated pedestrian locations. We consider a generic evaluation setting
  and one specific to pedestrian detection onboard a vehicle. Results indicate a clear
  advantage of HOG/linSVM at higher image resolutions and lower processing speeds,
  and a superiority of the wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade approach at lower image
  resolutions and (near) real-time processing speeds. The data set (8.5 GB) is made
  public for benchmarking purposes.'
