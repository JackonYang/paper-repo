paperAbstract: This paper presents a machine learning system for parsing natural language
  that learns from manually parsed example sentences, and parses unseen data at state-of-the-art
  accuracies. Its machine learning technology, based on the maximum entropy framework,
  is highly reusable and not specific to the parsing problem, while the linguistic
  hints that it uses to learn can be specified concisely. It therefore requires a
  minimal amount of human effort and linguistic knowledge for its construction. In
  practice, the running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect
  to the sentence length. We also demonstrate that the parser can train from other
  domains without modification to the modeling framework or the linguistic hints it
  uses to learn. Furthermore, this paper shows that research into rescoring the top
  20 parses returned by the parser might yield accuracies dramatically higher than
  the state-of-the-art.
