paperAbstract: We describe a new family of non-linear sequence models that are substantially
  more powerful than hidden Markov models or linear dynamical systems. Our models
  have simple approximate inference and learning procedures that work well in practice.
  Multilevel representations of sequential data can be learned one hidden layer at
  a time, and adding extra hidden layers improves the resulting generative models.
  The models can be trained with very high-dimensional, very non-linear data such
  as raw pixel sequences. Their performance is demonstrated using synthetic video
  sequences of two balls bouncing in a box.
