paperAbstract: Retrieving images from large and varied collections using image content
  as a key is a challenging and important problem. We present a new image representation
  that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions
  that are coherent in color and texture. This "Blobworld" representation is created
  by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation
  algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural
  images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve
  images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user
  is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query
  results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the
  system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite
  the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image
  regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects
  rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying
  for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color
  and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive
  objects.
