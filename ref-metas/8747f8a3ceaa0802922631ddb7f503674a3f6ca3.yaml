paperAbstract: While feature point recognition is a key component of modern approaches
  to object detection, existing approaches require computationally expensive patch
  preprocessing to handle perspective distortion. In this paper, we show that formulating
  the problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing
  unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore,
  it scales well to handle large number of classes. To recognize the patches surrounding
  keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class
  posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming
  independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly
  true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on
  image datasets containing very significant perspective changes.
