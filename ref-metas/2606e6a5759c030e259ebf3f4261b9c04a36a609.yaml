paperAbstract: Semantically complex queries which include attributes of objects and
  relations between objects still pose a major challenge to image retrieval systems.
  Recent work in computer vision has shown that a graph-based semantic representation
  called a scene graph is an effective representation for very detailed image descriptions
  and for complex queries for retrieval. In this paper, we show that scene graphs
  can be effectively created automatically from a natural language scene description.
  We present a rule-based and a classifierbased scene graph parser whose output can
  be used for image retrieval. We show that including relations and attributes in
  the query graph outperforms a model that only considers objects and that using the
  output of our parsers is almost as effective as using human-constructed scene graphs
  (Recall@10 of 27.1% vs. 33.4%). Additionally, we demonstrate the general usefulness
  of parsing to scene graphs by showing that the output can also be used to generate
  3D scenes.
