paperAbstract: The Internet contains billions of images, freely available online.
  Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a
  large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics,
  personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is
  to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only
  fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware
  or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning
  techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation
  energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary
  code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform
  real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain
  recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality
  labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition
  results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.
