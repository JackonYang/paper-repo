paperAbstract: We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing
  on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint
  distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail
  predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding
  to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize
  and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition
  as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate
  from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and
  semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining,
  particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections
  of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions
  and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions
  and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical
  clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation
  (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation
  (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images
  of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance.
  For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We
  present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring
  the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine
  whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation
  performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data,
  and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation
  proxy, and manually labeled data.
