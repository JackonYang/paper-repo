paperAbstract: We present a new algorithm to detect humans in still images utilizing
  covariance matrices as object descriptors. Since these descriptors do not lie on
  a vector space, well known machine learning techniques are not adequate to learn
  the classifiers. The space of d-dimensional nonsingular covariance matrices can
  be represented as a connected Riemannian manifold. We present a novel approach for
  classifying points lying on a Riemannian manifold by incorporating the a priori
  information about the geometry of the space. The algorithm is tested on INRIA human
  database where superior detection rates are observed over the previous approaches.
