paperAbstract: We evaluate whether features extracted from the activation of a deep
  convolutional network trained in a fully supervised fashion on a large, fixed set
  of object recognition tasks can be repurposed to novel generic tasks. Our generic
  tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be
  insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture
  to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional
  features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain
  adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of
  relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results
  that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges.
  We are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional
  activation features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision
  researchers to be able to conduct experimentation with deep representations across
  a range of visual concept learning paradigms.
