paperAbstract: In this paper, we address the problem of detecting pedestrians in still
  images. We introduce an algorithm for learning shapelet features, a set of mid-level
  features. These features are focused on local regions of the image and are built
  from low-level gradient information that discriminates between pedestrian and non-pedestrian
  classes. Using Ad-aBoost, these shapelet features are created as a combination of
  oriented gradient responses. To train the final classifier, we use AdaBoost for
  a second time to select a subset of our learned shapelets. By first focusing locally
  on smaller feature sets, our algorithm attempts to harvest more useful information
  than by examining all the low-level features together. We present quantitative results
  demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm. In particular, we obtain an error
  rate 14 percentage points lower (at 10-6 FPPW) than the previous state of the art
  detector of Dalal and Triggs on the INRIA dataset.
