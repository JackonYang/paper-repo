paperAbstract: Multilabel image annotation is one of the most important challenges
  in computer vision with many real-world applications. While existing work usually
  use conventional visual features for multilabel annotation, features based on Deep
  Neural Networks have shown potential to significantly boost performance. In this
  work, we propose to leverage the advantage of such features and analyze key components
  that lead to better performances. Specifically, we show that a significant performance
  gain could be obtained by combining convolutional architectures with approximate
  top-$k$ ranking objectives, as thye naturally fit the multilabel tagging problem.
  Our experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset outperforms the conventional visual features
  by about 10%, obtaining the best reported performance in the literature.
