paperAbstract: We introduce a novel method for constructing and selecting scale-invariant
  object parts. Scale-invariant local descriptors are first grouped into basic parts.
  A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used
  to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection,
  and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor
  the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection
  tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are
  demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods
  are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors
  are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines
  the importance of feature selection.
