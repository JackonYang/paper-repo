paperAbstract: 'We present a biologically-motivated system for the recognition of
  actions from video sequences. The approach builds on recent work on object recognition
  based on hierarchical feedforward architectures [25, 16, 20] and extends a neurobiological
  model of motion processing in the visual cortex [10]. The system consists of a hierarchy
  of spatio-temporal feature detectors of increasing complexity: an input sequence
  is first analyzed by an array of motion- direction sensitive units which, through
  a hierarchy of processing stages, lead to position-invariant spatio-temporal feature
  detectors. We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units
  as well as different system architectures. As in [16], we find that sparse features
  in intermediate stages outperform dense ones and that using a simple feature selection
  approach leads to an efficient system that performs better with far fewer features.
  We test the approach on different publicly available action datasets, in all cases
  achieving the highest results reported to date.'
