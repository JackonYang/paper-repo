paperAbstract: On the basis of his extensive and elegant anatomical investigations
  on the visual cortex, Poliak (1932) suggested that a mathematical projection of
  the retina on the cerebral cortex must exist. Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological
  methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface
  ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed
  as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which
  is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations
  and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and
  vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index
  and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii
  and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which
  Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field.
  We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex
  of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge,
  1959).
