paperAbstract: Recently, we proposed to transform the outputs of each hidden neuron
  in a multi-layer perceptron network to have zero output and zero slope on average,
  and use separate shortcut connections to model the linear dependencies instead.
  We continue the work by firstly introducing a third transformation to normalize
  the scale of the outputs of each hidden neuron, and secondly by analyzing the connections
  to second order optimization methods. We show that the transformations make a simple
  stochastic gradient behave closer to second-order optimization methods and thus
  speed up learning. This is shown both in theory and with experiments. The experiments
  on the third transformation show that while it further increases the speed of learning,
  it can also hurt performance by converging to a worse local optimum, where both
  the inputs and outputs of many hidden neurons are close to zero.
