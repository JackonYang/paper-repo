paperAbstract: Improving Neural Networks with Dropout Nitish Srivastava Master of
  Science Graduate Department of Computer Science University of Toronto 2013 Deep
  neural nets with a huge number of parameters are very powerful machine learning
  systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks
  are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining
  many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing
  this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections)
  from a neural network during training. This prevents the units from co-adapting
  too much. Dropping units creates thinned networks during training. The number of
  possible thinned networks is exponential in the number of units in the network.
  At test time all possible thinned networks are combined using an approximate model
  averaging procedure. Dropout training followed by this approximate model combination
  significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization
  methods. In this work, we describe models that improve the performance of neural
  networks using dropout, often obtaining state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
