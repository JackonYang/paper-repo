paperAbstract: Based on ideas from Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Learning To Classify
  Text Using Support Vector Machines presents a new approach to generating text classifiers
  from examples. The approach combines high performance and efficiency with theoretical
  understanding and improved robustness. In particular, it is highly effective without
  greedy heuristic components. The SVM approach is computationally efficient in training
  and classification, and it comes with a learning theory that can guide real-world
  applications. Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines gives a complete
  and detailed description of the SVM approach to learning text classifiers, including
  training algorithms, transductive text classification, efficient performance estimation,
  and a statistical learning model of text classification. In addition, it includes
  an overview of the field of text classification, making it self-contained even for
  newcomers to the field. This book gives a concise introduction to SVMs for pattern
  recognition, and it includes a detailed description of how to formulate text-classification
  tasks for machine learning.
