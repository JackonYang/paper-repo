paperAbstract: Many Internet information resources present relational data|telephone
  directories, product catalogs, etc. Because these sites are formatted for people,
  mechanically extracting their content is di cult. Systems using such resources typically
  use hand-coded wrappers, procedures to extract data from information resources.
  We introduce wrapper induction, a method for automatically constructing wrappers,
  and identify hlrt, a wrapper class that is e ciently learnable, yet expressive enough
  to handle 48% of a recently surveyed sample of Internet resources. We use PAC analysis
  to bound the problem's sample complexity, and show that the system degrades gracefully
  with imperfect labeling knowledge.
