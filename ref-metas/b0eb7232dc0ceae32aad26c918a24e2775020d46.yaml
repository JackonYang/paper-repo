paperAbstract: A lack of explicit quantitative models of imaging defects due to printing,
  optics, and digitization has retarded progress in some areas of document image analysis,
  including syntactic and structural approaches. Establishing the essential properties
  of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness
  of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress
  towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with
  a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random
  image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator
  are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier
  for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with
  a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators
  permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely
  extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases.
