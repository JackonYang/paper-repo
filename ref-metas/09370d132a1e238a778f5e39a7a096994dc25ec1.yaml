paperAbstract: Nearest neighbor classification expects the class conditional probabilities
  to be locally constant, and suffers from bias in high dimensions We propose a locally
  adaptive form of nearest neighbor classification to try to finesse this curse of
  dimensionality. We use a local linear discriminant analysis to estimate an effective
  metric for computing neighborhoods. We determine the local decision boundaries from
  centroid information, and then shrink neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to
  these local decision boundaries, and elongate them parallel to the boundaries. Thereafter,
  any neighborhood-based classifier can be employed, using the modified neighborhoods.
  The posterior probabilities tend to be more homogeneous in the modified neighborhoods.
  We also propose a method for global dimension reduction, that combines local dimension
  information. In a number of examples, the methods demonstrate the potential for
  substantial improvements over nearest neighbour classification.
