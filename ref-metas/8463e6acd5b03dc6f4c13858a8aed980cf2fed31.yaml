paperAbstract: This paper presents a low-level system for boundary extraction and
  segmentation of natural images and the evaluation of its performance. We study the
  problem in the framework of hierarchical classification, where the geometric structure
  of an image can be represented by an ultrametric contour map, the soft boundary
  image associated to a family of nested segmentations. We define generic ultrametric
  distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining
  this information with region attributes. Then, we evaluate quantitatively our results
  with respect to ground-truth segmentation data, proving that our system outperforms
  significantly two widely used hierarchical segmentation techniques, as well as the
  state of the art in local edge detection.
