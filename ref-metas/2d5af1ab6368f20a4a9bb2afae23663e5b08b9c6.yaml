paperAbstract: "Lecture Notes for the MSc/DTC module. The brain is a complex computing\
  \ machine which has evolved to give the ttest output to a given input. Neural computation\
  \ has as goal to describe the function of the nervous system in mathematical and\
  \ computational terms. By analysing or simulating the resulting equations, one can\
  \ better understand its function, research how changes in parameters would eect\
  \ the function, and try to mimic the nervous system in hardware or software implementations.\
  \ Neural Computation is a bit like physics, that has been successful in describing\
  \ numerous physical phenomena. However, approaches developed in those elds not always\
  \ work for neural computation, because: 1. Physical systems are best studied in\
  \ reduced, simplied circumstances, but the nervous system is hard to study in isolation.\
  \ Neurons require a narrow range of operating conditions (temperature, oxygen, presence\
  \ of other neurons, ion concentrations, ...) under which they work as they should.\
  \ These conditions are hard to reproduce outside the body. Secondly, the neurons\
  \ form a highly interconnected network. The function of the nervous systems depends\
  \ on this connectivity and interaction, by trying to isolate the components, you\
  \ are likely to alter the function. 2. It is not clear how much detail one needs\
  \ to describe the computations in the brain. In these lectures we shall see various\
  \ description levels. 3. Neural signals and neural connectivity are hard to measure,\
  \ especially, if disturbance and damage to the nervous system is to be kept minimal.\
  \ Perhaps Neural Computation has more in common with trying to gure out how a complicated\
  \ machine, such as a computer or car works. Knowledge of the basic physics helps,\
  \ but is not sucient. Luckily there are factors which perhaps make understanding\
  \ the brain easier than understanding an arbitrary complicated machine: 1. There\
  \ is a high degree of conservation across species. This means that animal studies\
  \ can be used to gain information about the human brain. Furthermore, study of,\
  \ say, the visual system might help to understand the auditory system. 2. The nervous\
  \ system is able to develop by combining on one hand a only limited amount of genetic\
  \ information and, on the other hand, the input it receives. Therefore it might\
  \ be possible to nd the organising principles and develop a brain from there. This\
  \ would be easier than guring out the complete 'wiring diagram'. 3. The nervous\
  \ system is exible and robust, neurons die everyday. This stands \u2026"
