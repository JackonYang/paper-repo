paperAbstract: Whereas theoretical work suggests that deep architectures might be
  more e cient at representing highly-varying functions, training deep architectures
  was unsuccessful until the recent advent of algorithms based on unsupervised pretraining.
  Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions
  remain as to the nature of this di cult learning problem. Answering these questions
  is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt
  to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments
  confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate
  the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization,
  the positive e ect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a regularizer.
  We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth,
  model capacity, and number of training examples.
