paperAbstract: In this section we use the representations of the noise currents given
  in section 2.8 to derive some statistical properties of I(t). The first six sections
  are concerned with the probability distribution of I(t) and of its zeros and maxima.
  Sections 3.7 and 3.8 are concerned with the statistical properties of the envelope
  of I(t). Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9.
  The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10
  and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned.
  Prof. Uhlenbeck has pointed out that much of the material in this Part is closely
  connected with the theory of Markoff processes. Also S. Chandrasekhar has written
  a review of a class of physical problems which is related, in a general way, to
  the present subject.22
