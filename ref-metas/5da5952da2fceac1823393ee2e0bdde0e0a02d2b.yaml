paperAbstract: Structured data, in the form of entities and associated attributes,
  has been a rich web resource for search engines and knowledge databases. To efficiently
  extract structured data from enormous websites in various verticals (e.g., books,
  restaurants), much research effort has been attracted, but most existing approaches
  either require considerable human effort or rely on strong features that lack of
  flexibility. We consider an ambitious scenario -- can we build a system that (1)
  is general enough to handle any vertical without re-implementation and (2) requires
  only one labeled example site from each vertical for training to automatically deal
  with other sites in the same vertical? In this paper, we propose a unified solution
  to demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario. Specifically, we design a set of
  weak but general features to characterize vertical knowledge (including attribute-specific
  semantics and inter-attribute layout relationships). Such features can be adopted
  in various verticals without redesign; meanwhile, they are weak enough to avoid
  overfitting of the learnt knowledge to seed sites. Given a new unseen site, the
  learnt knowledge is first applied to identify page-level candidate attribute values,
  while inevitably involve false positives. To remove noise, site-level information
  of the new site is then exploited to boost up the true values. The site-level information
  is derived in an unsupervised manner, without harm to the applicability of the solution.
  Promising experimental performance on 80 websites in 8 distinct verticals demonstrated
  the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed solution.
