paperAbstract: "A photoelectric analog of the visual system is constructed in conformance\
  \ with anatomical data. The analog has the form of a color television camera chain\
  \ feeding electrical signals to a \u201Ccomputer\u201D (the brain). Evaluation of\
  \ characteristics is limited to elements preceding the computer, and particularly\
  \ to the \u201Cluminance channel\u201D of the color system.The primary photoelectric\
  \ transfer characteristics n\xAF1=f(Er) of the receptors (rods and cones) are computed\
  \ as a function of retinal illumination (Er) from threshold signal-to-noise ratios\
  \ in the effective image area of point sources, disks, and other test objects. The\
  \ effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling\
  \ area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants\
  \ of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye,\
  \ its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units\
  \ of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants,\
  \ if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."
