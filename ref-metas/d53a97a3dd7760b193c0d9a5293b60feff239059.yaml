paperAbstract: We propose a method for describing human activities from video images
  based on concept hierarchies of actions. Major difficulty in transforming video
  images into textual descriptions is how to bridge a semantic gap between them, which
  is also known as inverse Hollywood problem. In general, the concepts of events or
  actions of human can be classified by semantic primitives. By associating these
  concepts with the semantic features extracted from video images, appropriate syntactic
  components such as verbs, objects, etc. are determined and then translated into
  natural language sentences. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed
  method by several experiments.
