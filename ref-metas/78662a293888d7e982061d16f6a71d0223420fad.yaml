paperAbstract: "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the\
  \ problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated\
  \ machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However,\
  \ these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive\
  \ and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing\
  \ heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple\
  \ detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial\
  \ to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We\
  \ introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem\
  \ as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each\
  \ image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling\
  \ of the entire image (Fig.\_1). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial\
  \ arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which\
  \ arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial\
  \ co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin\
  \ learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we\
  \ show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the\
  \ cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\_2009) to efficiently\
  \ learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results\
  \ on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model\
  \ encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version\
  \ of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference\
  \ on computer vision,\_2009)."
