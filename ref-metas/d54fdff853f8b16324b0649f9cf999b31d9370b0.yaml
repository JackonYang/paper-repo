paperAbstract: In this paper, we first provide a new perspective to divide existing
  high performance object detection methods into direct and indirect regressions.
  Direct regression performs boundary regression by predicting the offsets from a
  given point, while indirect regression predicts the offsets from some bounding box
  proposals. In the context of multioriented scene text detection, we analyze the
  drawbacks of indirect regression, which covers the state-of-the-art detection structures
  Faster-RCNN and SSD as instances, and point out the potential superiority of direct
  regression. To verify this point of view, we propose a deep direct regression based
  method for multi-oriented scene text detection. Our detection framework is simple
  and effective with a fully convolutional network and one-step post processing. The
  fully convolutional network is optimized in an end-to-end way and has bi-task outputs
  where one is pixel-wise classification between text and non-text, and the other
  is direct regression to determine the vertex coordinates of quadrilateral text boundaries.
  The proposed method is particularly beneficial to localize incidental scene texts.
  On the ICDAR2015 Incidental Scene Text benchmark, our method achieves the F-measure
  of 81%, which is a new state-ofthe-art and significantly outperforms previous approaches.
  On other standard datasets with focused scene texts, our method also reaches the
  state-of-the-art performance.
