paperAbstract: This thesis looks at the issues relating to the development of technology
  capable of processing tables as they appear in textual documents so that their contents
  may be accessed and further interpreted by standard information extraction and natural
  language processing systems. The thesis offers a formal description of the table
  and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that
  model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at
  tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and
  reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second
  part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment
  for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design,
  implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model
  for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection
  of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis
  catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during
  the research and provides appropriate terminology.
