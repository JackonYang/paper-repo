paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new class of upper bounds on the log partition function
  of a Markov random field (MRF). This quantity plays an important role in various
  contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation,
  combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds.
  Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry:
  in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain,
  and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special
  case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family
  of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished
  by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global
  optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function.
  This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining
  fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum
  of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements
  of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the
  original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured
  distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants.'
