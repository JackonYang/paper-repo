paperAbstract: Stable local feature detection and representation is a fundamental
  component of many image registration and object recognition algorithms. Mikolajczyk
  and Schmid (June 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified
  the SIFT [D. G. Lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image
  deformations. This paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor
  used by SIFT. Like SIFT, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image
  gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using SIFT's smoothed
  weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to the normalized
  gradient patch. Our experiments demonstrate that the PCA-based local descriptors
  are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the
  standard SIFT representation. We also present results showing that using these descriptors
  in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching.
