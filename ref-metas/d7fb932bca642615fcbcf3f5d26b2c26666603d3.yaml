paperAbstract: 'Cells in the cat''s striate cortex show marked specificity in their
  responses to restricted retinal stimulation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962). The most
  effective stimulus shapes are long narrow rectangles of light (''slits''), dark
  bars against a light background (''dark bars''), and straight-line borders separating
  areas of different brightness (''edges''). A given cell responds vigorously when
  an appropriate stimulus is shone on the receptive field or moved across it, provided
  the stimulus is presented in a specific orientation. This orientation is termed
  the ''receptive-field axis orientation''. It is critical, and constant for any particular
  cell, but may differ for different cells. The visual cortex is subdivided into discrete
  regions or columns extending from surface to white matter, in which all cells have
  the same receptivefield axis orientation (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). The present experiments
  were undertaken with the object of learning more about the anatomical configuration
  of the columns. We wished to have a clearer idea of their shape, especially if the
  walls of a column were, as previous work suggested, parallel to the radial fibre
  bundles of the cortex and perpendicular to the cortical layers, and whether the
  columns were uniform or irregular in their cross-sectional shape and size. Furthermore,
  we were curious to know if there was any relationship between the receptive-field
  axis orientations of neighbouring columns, or whether, on the contrary, the different
  columns were intermixed in a random way throughout the cortex. These questions were
  approached: (1) by making several deep, closely spaced, parallel micro-electrode
  penetrations, placing electrolytic lesions at every shift in receptive-field orientation,
  and(2) by making many short penetrations in a small cortical area, noting the axis
  orientation of cells lying in the upper one or two layers of cortex.'
