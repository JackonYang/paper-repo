paperAbstract: Automatic grouping and segmentation of images remains a challenging
  problem in computer vision. Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good
  performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity
  matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple
  eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless,
  the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood.
  In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close
  connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then
  prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance
  of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to
  motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different
  eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on
  real and synthetic images.
