paperAbstract: This paper presents generalizations of Bayes likelihood-ratio updating
  rule which facilitate an asynchronous propagation of the impacts of new beliefs
  and/or new evidence in hierarchically organized inference structures with multi-hypotheses
  variables. The computational scheme proposed specifies a set of belief parameters,
  communication messages and updating rules which guarantee that the diffusion of
  updated beliefs is accomplished in a single pass and complies with the tenets of
  Bayes calculus.
