paperAbstract: While different optical flow techniques continue to appear, there has
  been a lack of quantitative evaluation of existing methods. For a common set of
  real and synthetic image sequences, we report the results of a number of regularly
  cited optical flow techniques, including instances of differential, matching, energy-based,
  and phase-based methods. Our comparisons are primarily empirical, and concentrate
  on the accuracy, reliability, and density of the velocity measurements; they show
  that performance can differ significantly among the techniques we implemented.
