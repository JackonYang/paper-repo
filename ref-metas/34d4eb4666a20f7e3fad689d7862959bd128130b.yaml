paperAbstract: This paper provides an algorithm for partitioning grayscale images
  into disjoint regions of coherent brightness and texture. Natural images contain
  both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences
  are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework,
  while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability,
  so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness
  of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two
  nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic
  framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent
  texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown.
