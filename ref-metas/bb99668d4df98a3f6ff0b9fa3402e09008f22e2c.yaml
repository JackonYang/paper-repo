paperAbstract: Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization
  problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact
  that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered
  in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training
  examples, oo-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly
  become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SV M light1 is an implementation
  of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents
  algorithmic and computational results developed for SV M light V2.0, which make
  large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application
  of SVMs to large domains.
