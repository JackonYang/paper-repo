paperAbstract: This paper examines fundamental problems underlying difficulties encountered
  by pattern recognition algorithms, neural networks, and rule systems. These problems
  are manifested as combinatorial complexity of algorithms, of their computational
  or training requirements. The paper relates particular types of complexity problems
  to the roles of a priori knowledge and adaptive learning. Paradigms based on adaptive
  learning lead to the complexity of training procedures, while nonadaptive rule-based
  paradigms lead to complexity of rule systems. Model-based approaches to combining
  adaptivity with a priori knowledge lead to computational complexity. Arguments are
  presented for the Aristotelian logic being culpable for the difficulty of combining
  adaptivity and a priority. The potential role of the fuzzy logic in overcoming current
  difficulties is discussed. Current mathematical difficulties are related to philosophical
  debates of the past.
