paperAbstract: We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in
  computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team
  (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial,
  neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are
  found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization
  problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory
  requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition
  algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over
  very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution
  of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both
  to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria
  for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM,
  and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that
  involves a data set of 50,000 data points.
