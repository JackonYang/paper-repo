paperAbstract: In many real-world domains, supervised learning requires a large number
  of training examples. In this paper, we describe an active learning method that
  uses a committee of learners to reduce the number of training examples required
  for learning. Our approach is similar to the Query by Committee framework, where
  disagreement among the committee members on the predicted label for the input part
  of the example is used to signal the need for knowing the actual value of the label.
  Our experiments are conducted in the text categorization domain, which is characterized
  by a large number of features, many of which are irrelevant. We report here on experiments
  using a committee of Winnowbased learners and demonstrate that this approach can
  reduce the number of labeled training examples required over that used by a single
  Winnow learner by l-2 orders of magnitude. 1. Hntroduction
