paperAbstract: Passive sensing of human hand and limb motion is important for a wide
  range of applications from human-computer interaction to athletic performance measurement.
  High degree of freedom articulated mechanisms like the human hand are difficult
  to track because of their large state space and complex image appearance. This article
  describes a model-based hand tracking system, called DigitEyes, that can recover
  the state of a 27 DOF hand model from ordinary gray scale images at speeds of up
  to 10 Hz.
