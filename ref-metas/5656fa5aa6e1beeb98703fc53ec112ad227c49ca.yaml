paperAbstract: We introduce the multi-prediction deep Boltzmann machine (MP-DBM).
  The MP-DBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational
  approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets
  that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior
  methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classification tasks or require
  an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The
  MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard
  DBM at classification, classification with missing inputs, and mean field prediction
  tasks.1
