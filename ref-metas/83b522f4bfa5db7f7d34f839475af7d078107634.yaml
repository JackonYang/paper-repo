paperAbstract: In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse
  representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype
  signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms.
  Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization
  in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field
  has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals
  with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above
  model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms
  or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques
  have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose
  a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations.
  Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation
  for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new
  method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is
  an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based
  on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better
  fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of
  the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm
  is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or
  matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on
  synthetic tests and in applications on real image data
