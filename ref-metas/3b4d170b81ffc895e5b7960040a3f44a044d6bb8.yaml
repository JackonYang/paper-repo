paperAbstract: Carnegie Mellon's Informedia Digital Video Library project will establish
  a large, on-line digital video library featuring full-content and knowledge-based
  search and retrieval. Intelligent, automatic mechanisms will be developed to populate
  the library. Search and retrieval from digital video, audio, and text libraries
  will take place via desktop computer over local, metropolitan, and wide-area networks.
  The project's approach applies several techniques for content-based searching and
  video-sequence retrieval. Content is conveyed in both the narrative (speech and
  language) and the image. Only by the collaborative interaction of image, speech,
  and natural language understanding technology is it possible to successfully populate,
  segment, index, and search diverse video collections with satisfactory recall and
  precision. This collaborative interaction approach uniquely compensates for problems
  of interpretation and search in error-ridden and ambiguous data sets. The authors
  have focused the work on two corpuses. One is science documentaries and lectures,
  the other is broadcast news content with partial closed-captions. Further work will
  continue to improve the accuracy and performance of the underlying processing as
  well as explore performance issues related to Web-based access and interoperability
  with other digital video resources.
