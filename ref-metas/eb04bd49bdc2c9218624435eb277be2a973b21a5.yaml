paperAbstract: As an increasing amount of RDF data is published as Linked Data, intuitive
  ways of accessing this data become more and more important. Question answering approaches
  have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity.
  Most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched
  against the RDF data to retrieve an answer, typically relying on some similarity
  metric. However, in many cases, triples do not represent a faithful representation
  of the semantic structure of the natural language question, with the result that
  more expressive queries can not be answered. To circumvent this problem, we present
  a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a SPARQL template
  that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question. This template is then
  instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection. We
  show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be
  answered with our approach but not with competing approaches.
