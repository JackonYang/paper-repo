paperAbstract: Keyword spotting refers to the process of retrieving all instances
  of a given keyword from a document. In the present paper, a novel keyword spotting
  method for handwritten documents is described. It is derived from a neural network-based
  system for unconstrained handwriting recognition. As such it performs template-free
  spotting, i.e., it is not necessary for a keyword to appear in the training set.
  The keyword spotting is done using a modification of the CTC Token Passing algorithm
  in conjunction with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the proposed
  systems outperform not only a classical dynamic time warping-based approach but
  also a modern keyword spotting system, based on hidden Markov models. Furthermore,
  we analyze the performance of the underlying neural networks when using them in
  a recognition task followed by keyword spotting on the produced transcription. We
  point out the advantages of keyword spotting when compared to classic text line
  recognition.
