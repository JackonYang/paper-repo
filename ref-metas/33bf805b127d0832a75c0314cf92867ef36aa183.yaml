paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a method of document image segmentation for pages
  with document components of arbitrary shape as well as any skew angles. The characteristics
  of the proposed method are as follows: the Voronoi diagram is constructed based
  on the connected components to obtain the candidates of boundaries of document components;
  and the candidates are utilized to estimate the inter-character, inter-line and
  inter-column gaps without the use of domain specific parameters so as to select
  the boundaries. From the experimental results for 80 images with non-Manhattan layout
  and the skews of 0/spl deg//spl sim/450. We have confirmed that the method is effective
  for extraction of column regions and as efficient as other methods based on connected
  component analysis.'
