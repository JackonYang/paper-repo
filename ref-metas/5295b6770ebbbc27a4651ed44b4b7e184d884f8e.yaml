paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an approach to automatic detection and recognition
  of signs from natural scenes, and its application to a sign translation task. The
  proposed approach embeds multiresolution and multiscale edge detection, adaptive
  searching, color analysis, and affine rectification in a hierarchical framework
  for sign detection, with different emphases at each phase to handle the text in
  different sizes, orientations, color distributions and backgrounds. We use affine
  rectification to recover deformation of the text regions caused by an inappropriate
  camera view angle. The procedure can significantly improve text detection rate and
  optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. Instead of using binary information
  for OCR, we extract features from an intensity image directly. We propose a local
  intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations, followed
  by a Gabor transform to obtain local features, and finally a linear discriminant
  analysis (LDA) method for feature selection. We have applied the approach in developing
  a Chinese sign translation system, which can automatically detect and recognize
  Chinese signs as input from a camera, and translate the recognized text into English.
