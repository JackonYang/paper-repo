paperAbstract: "In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of\
  \ sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains\
  \ prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of\
  \ these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include\
  \ compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more.\
  \ Recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms\
  \ that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries\
  \ to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a pre-specified\
  \ set of linear transforms, or by adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals.\
  \ Both these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open.\
  \ In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order\
  \ to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we\
  \ seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this\
  \ set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method \u2013 the K-SVD\
  \ algorithm \u2013 generalizing the K-Means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative\
  \ method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current\
  \ dictionary, and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data.\
  \ The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse\
  \ representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible\
  \ and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching\
  \ pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results on both synthetic\
  \ tests and in applications on real image data."
