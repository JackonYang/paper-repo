paperAbstract: "In complex inferential tasks like question answering, machine learning\
  \ models must confront two challenges: the need to implement a compositional reasoning\
  \ process, and, in many applications, the need for this reasoning process to be\
  \ interpretable to assist users in both development and prediction. Existing models\
  \ designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making process typically\
  \ require these traces to be supervised at training time. In this paper, we present\
  \ a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically\
  \ inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision.\
  \ Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that\
  \ handle common routines across tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable\
  \ to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better\
  \ understand the model\u2019s underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it\
  \ will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs."
