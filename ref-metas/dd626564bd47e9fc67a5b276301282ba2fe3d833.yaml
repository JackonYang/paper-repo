paperAbstract: We consider the problem of detecting a large number of different classes
  of objects in cluttered scenes. Traditional approaches require applying a battery
  of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can
  be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the
  computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained
  detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample
  complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present
  a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the
  computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared
  across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly,
  rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features
  required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale
  approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected
  by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by
  training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features
  generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object
  detection
