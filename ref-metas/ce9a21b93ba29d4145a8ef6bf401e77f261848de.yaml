paperAbstract: The exact form of a gradient-following learning algorithm for completely
  recurrent networks running in continually sampled time is derived and used as the
  basis for practical algorithms for temporal supervised learning tasks. These algorithms
  have (1) the advantage that they do not require a precisely defined training interval,
  operating while the network runs; and (2) the disadvantage that they require nonlocal
  communication in the network being trained and are computationally expensive. These
  algorithms allow networks having recurrent connections to learn complex tasks that
  require the retention of information over time periods having either fixed or indefinite
  length.
