paperAbstract: 'Shared and internationally recognized benchmarks are fundamental for
  the development of any computational system. We aim to help the research community
  working on compositional distributional semantic models (CDSMs) by providing SICK
  (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowldedge), a large size English benchmark tailored
  for them. SICK consists of about 10,000 English sentence pairs that include many
  examples of the lexical, syntactic and semantic phenomena that CDSMs are expected
  to account for, but do not require dealing with other aspects of existing sentential
  data sets (idiomatic multiword expressions, named entities, telegraphic language)
  that are not within the scope of CDSMs. By means of crowdsourcing techniques, each
  pair was annotated for two crucial semantic tasks: relatedness in meaning (with
  a 5-point rating scale as gold score) and entailment relation between the two elements
  (with three possible gold labels: entailment, contradiction, and neutral). The SICK
  data set was used in SemEval-2014 Task 1, and it freely available for research purposes.'
