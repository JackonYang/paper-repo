paperAbstract: The problem of establishing image-to-image correspondences is fundamental
  in computer vision. Recently, several wide baseline matching algorithms capable
  of handling large changes of viewpoint have appeared. By computing feature values
  from image data, these algorithms mainly use appearance as a cue for matching. Topological
  information, i.e. spatial relations between features, has also been used, but not
  nearly to the same extent as appearance. In this paper, we incorporate topological
  constraints into an existing matching algorithm [1] which matches image intensity
  profiles between interest points. We show that the algorithm can be improved by
  exploiting the constraint that the intensity profiles around each interest point
  should be cyclically ordered. String matching techniques allows for an efficient
  implementation of the ordering constraint. Experiments with real data indicate that
  the modified algorithm indeed gives superior results to the original one. The method
  of enforcing the spatial constraints is not limited to the presented case, but can
  be used on any algorithm where interest point correspondences are sought.
