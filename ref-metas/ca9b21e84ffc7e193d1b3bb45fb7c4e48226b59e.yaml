paperAbstract: We analyse the convergence of stochastic algorithms with Markovian
  noise when the ergodicity of the Markov chain governing the noise rapidly decreases
  as the control parameter tends to infinity. In such a case, there may be a positive
  probability of divergence of the algorithm in the classic Robbins-Monro form. We
  provide sufficient condition which ensure convergence. Moreover, we analyse the
  asymptotic behaviour of these algorithms and state a diffusion approximation theorem
