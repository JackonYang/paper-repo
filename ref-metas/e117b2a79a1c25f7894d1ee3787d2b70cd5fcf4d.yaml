paperAbstract: This paper proposes a novel similarity measure between vector sequences.
  We work in the framework of model-based approaches, where each sequence is first
  mapped to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and then a measure of similarity is computed
  between the HMMs. We propose to model sequences with semicontinuous HMMs (SC-HMMs).
  This is a particular type of HMM whose emission probabilities in each state are
  mixtures of shared Gaussians. This crucial constraint provides two major benefits.
  First, the a priori information contained in the common set of Gaussians leads to
  a more accurate estimate of the HMM parameters. Second, the computation of a similarity
  between two SC-HMMs can be simplified to a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between their
  mixture weight vectors, which significantly reduces the computational cost. Experiments
  are carried out on a handwritten word retrieval task in three different datasets-an
  in-house dataset of real handwritten letters, the George Washington dataset, and
  the IFN/ENIT dataset of Arabic handwritten words. These experiments show that the
  proposed similarity outperforms the traditional DTW between the original sequences,
  and the model-based approach which uses ordinary continuous HMMs. We also show that
  this increase in accuracy can be traded against a significant reduction of the computational
  cost.
