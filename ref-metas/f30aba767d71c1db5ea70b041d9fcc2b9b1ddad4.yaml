paperAbstract: "Discriminative training approaches like structural SVMs have shown\
  \ much promise for building highly complex and accurate models in areas like natural\
  \ language processing, protein structure prediction, and information retrieval.\
  \ However, current training algorithms are computationally expensive or intractable\
  \ on large datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper explores how cutting-plane\
  \ methods can provide fast training not only for classification SVMs, but also for\
  \ structural SVMs. We show that for an equivalent \u201C1-slack\u201D reformulation\
  \ of the linear SVM training problem, our cutting-plane method has time complexity\
  \ linear in the number of training examples. In particular, the number of iterations\
  \ does not depend on the number of training examples, and it is linear in the desired\
  \ precision and the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we present an extensive\
  \ empirical evaluation of the method applied to binary classification, multi-class\
  \ classification, HMM sequence tagging, and CFG parsing. The experiments show that\
  \ the cutting-plane algorithm is broadly applicable and fast in practice. On large\
  \ datasets, it is typically several orders of magnitude faster than conventional\
  \ training methods derived from decomposition methods like SVM-light, or conventional\
  \ cutting-plane methods. Implementations of our methods are available at www.joachims.org."
