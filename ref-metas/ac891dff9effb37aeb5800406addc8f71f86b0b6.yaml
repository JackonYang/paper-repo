paperAbstract: The text develops a global shape model and applies it to the analysis
  of real pictures acquired with a visible light camera under varying conditions of
  optical degradation. Computational feasibility of the algorithms derived from this
  model is achieved by analytical means. The aim is to develop methods for image understanding
  based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities.
  The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical
  degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their
  task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in
  pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision
  or pattern recognition.
