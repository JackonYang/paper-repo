paperAbstract: Learning from a few examples remains a key challenge in machine learning.
  Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard
  supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning
  new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric
  learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural
  networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small
  labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need
  for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems
  on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves
  one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6% to 93.2% and from 88.0% to 93.8% on Omniglot
  compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same
  model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.
