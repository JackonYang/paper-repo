paperAbstract: Tabular structures in documents offer a complementary dimension to
  the raw textual data, representing logical or quantitative relationships among pieces
  of information. In digital mail room applications, where a large amount of administrative
  documents must be processed with reasonable accuracy, the detection and interpretation
  of tables is crucial. Table recognition has gained interest in document image analysis,
  in particular in unconstrained formats (absence of rule lines, unknown information
  of rows and columns). In this work, we propose a graph-based approach for detecting
  tables in document images. Instead of using the raw content (recognized text), we
  make use of the location, context and content type, thus it is purely a structure
  perception approach, not dependent on the language and the quality of the text reading.
  Our framework makes use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in order to describe the
  local repetitive structural information of tables in invoice documents. Our proposed
  model has been experimentally validated in two invoice datasets and achieved encouraging
  results. Additionally, due to the scarcity of benchmark datasets for this task,
  we have contributed to the community a novel dataset derived from the RVL-CDIP invoice
  data. It will be publicly released to facilitate future research.
