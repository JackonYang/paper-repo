paperAbstract: "I propose to consider the question, \u201CCan machines think?\u201D\
  \u2663 This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms \u201Cmachine\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cthink\u201D. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far\
  \ as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the\
  \ meaning of the words \u201Cmachine\u201D and \u201Cthink\u201D are to be found\
  \ by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion\
  \ that the meaning and the answer to the question, \u201CCan machines think?\u201D\
  \ is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll."
