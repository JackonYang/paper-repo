paperAbstract: A document can be divided into zones on the basis of its content. For
  example, a zone can be either text or non-text. This paper describes an algorithm
  to classify each given document zone into one of nine different classes. Features
  for each zone such as run length mean and variance, spatial mean and variance, fraction
  of the total number of black pixels in the zone, and the zone width ratio for each
  zone are extracted. Run length related features are computed along four different
  canonical directions. A decision tree classifier is used to assign a zone class
  on the basis of its feature vector. The performance on an independent test set was
  97%.
