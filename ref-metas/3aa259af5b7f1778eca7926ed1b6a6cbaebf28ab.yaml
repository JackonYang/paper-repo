paperAbstract: 'Generic object detection is the challenging task of proposing windows
  that localize all the objects in an image, regardless of their classes. Such detectors
  have recently been shown to benefit many applications such as speeding-up class-specific
  object detection, weakly supervised learning of object detectors and object discovery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel and very efficient method for generic object
  detection based on a randomized version of Prim''s algorithm. Using the connectivity
  graph of an image''s super pixels, with weights modelling the probability that neighbouring
  super pixels belong to the same object, the algorithm generates random partial spanning
  trees with large expected sum of edge weights. Object localizations are proposed
  as bounding-boxes of those partial trees. Our method has several benefits compared
  to the state-of-the-art. Thanks to the efficiency of Prim''s algorithm, it samples
  proposals very quickly: 1000 proposals are obtained in about 0.7s. With proposals
  bound to super pixel boundaries yet diversified by randomization, it yields very
  high detection rates and windows that tightly fit objects. In extensive experiments
  on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and SUN2012 benchmark datasets, we show
  that our method improves over state-of-the-art competitors for a wide range of evaluation
  scenarios.'
