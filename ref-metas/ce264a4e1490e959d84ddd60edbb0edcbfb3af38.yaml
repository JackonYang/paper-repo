paperAbstract: 'People often refer to entities in an image in terms of their relationships
  with other entities. For example, the black cat sitting under the table refers to
  both a black cat entity and its relationship with another table entity. Understanding
  these relationships is essential for interpreting and grounding such natural language
  expressions. Most prior work focuses on either grounding entire referential expressions
  holistically to one region, or localizing relationships based on a fixed set of
  categories. In this paper we instead present a modular deep architecture capable
  of analyzing referential expressions into their component parts, identifying entities
  and relationships mentioned in the input expression and grounding them all in the
  scene. We call this approach Compositional Modular Networks (CMNs): a novel architecture
  that learns linguistic analysis and visual inference end-to-end. Our approach is
  built around two types of neural modules that inspect local regions and pairwise
  interactions between regions. We evaluate CMNs on multiple referential expression
  datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.'
