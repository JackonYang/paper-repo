paperAbstract: We give a unified account of boosting and logistic regression in which
  each learning problem is cast in terms of optimization of Bregman distances. The
  striking similarity of the two problems in this framework allows us to design and
  analyze algorithms for both simultaneously, and to easily adapt algorithms designed
  for one problem to the other. For both problems, we give new algorithms and explain
  their potential advantages over existing methods. These algorithms are iterative
  and can be divided into two types based on whether the parameters are updated sequentially
  (one at a time) or in parallel (all at once). We also describe a parameterized family
  of algorithms that includes both a sequential- and a parallel-update algorithm as
  special cases, thus showing how the sequential and parallel approaches can themselves
  be unified. For all of the algorithms, we give convergence proofs using a general
  formalization of the auxiliary-function proof technique. As one of our sequential-update
  algorithms is equivalent to AdaBoost, this provides the first general proof of convergence
  for AdaBoost. We show that all of our algorithms generalize easily to the multiclass
  case, and we contrast the new algorithms with the iterative scaling algorithm. We
  conclude with a few experimental results with synthetic data that highlight the
  behavior of the old and newly proposed algorithms in different settings.
