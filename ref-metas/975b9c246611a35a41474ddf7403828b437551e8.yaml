paperAbstract: This book introduces fundamental techniques for computing semantic
  representations for fragments of natural language and performing inference with
  the result. The prinary tools used are first-order logic and lambda calculus. All
  the techniques introduced are implemented in Prolog. The book also shown how to
  use theorem provers and model builders in parallel to deal with natrual language
  inference.
