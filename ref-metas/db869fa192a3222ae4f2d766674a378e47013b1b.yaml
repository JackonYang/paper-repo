paperAbstract: Artificial "neural networks" are widely used as flexible models for
  classification and regression applications, but questions remain about how the power
  of these models can be safely exploited when training data is limited. This book
  demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used
  without fear of the "overfitting" that can occur with traditional training methods.
  Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical
  investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation
  of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also
  described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing
  only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest
  to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence.
