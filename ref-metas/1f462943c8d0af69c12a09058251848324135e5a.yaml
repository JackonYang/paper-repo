paperAbstract: 'We are concerned with feed-forward non-linear networks (multi-layer
  perceptrons, or MLPs) with multiple outputs. We wish to treat the outputs of the
  network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on
  the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria
  for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications:
  probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and
  a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity.
  The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation
  is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot
  product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes
  posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class
  distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result
  in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training
  method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct.'
