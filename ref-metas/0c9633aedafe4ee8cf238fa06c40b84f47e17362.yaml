paperAbstract: Recently SVMs using spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel have been
  highly successful in image classification. Despite its popularity, these nonlinear
  SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ~ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the
  training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle
  more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of
  the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by
  multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse
  codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training
  and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find
  that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse
  coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel
  on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art
  performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors.
