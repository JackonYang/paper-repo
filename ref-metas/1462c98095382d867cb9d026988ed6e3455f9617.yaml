paperAbstract: 'Forms are used extensively in today''s offices. The task of an automated
  form reader is to locate data filled on a form and to encode the content into appropriate
  symbolic descriptions. The challenges in form reading are due to high volume and
  large variety. A robust form reader with high adaptability and trainability. The
  form reader consists of two modules: field registration and data recognition module.
  The field registration module acquires knowledge about the forms of interest and
  the data recognition module recognizes text data on filled forms using the acquired
  knowledge. The capability of the reader increases progressively through supervised
  learning. The form reader has been training to read a large variety of forms with
  machine-printed data. The adaptability and trainability of the system have been
  demonstrated through the experiments.<<ETX>>'
