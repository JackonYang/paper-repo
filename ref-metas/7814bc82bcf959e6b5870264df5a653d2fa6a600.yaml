paperAbstract: "Psychometric functions were determined concurrently for detection\
  \ of simple gratings (luminance sinusoidally modulated with spatial frequency f)\
  \ and complex gratings (luminance modulated by the sum of two sinusoids, with frequencies\
  \ f and f\u2032). Results were used to test the hypothesis that the two components\
  \ of a complex grating may be detected independently. In an extensive experiment\
  \ with f = 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected\
  \ only when f/f\u2032=54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f\u2032\
  \ lay outside this range. In other experiments, f was between 1.9 and 22.4 cycles/deg.\
  \ All results are compatible with the assumption that the human visual system contains\
  \ sensory channels, each selectively sensitive to different narrow ranges of spatial\
  \ frequencies, whose outputs are detected independently."
