paperAbstract: Edge detection is one of the most studied problems in computer vision,
  yet it remains a very challenging task. It is difficult since often the decision
  for an edge cannot be made purely based on low level cues such as gradient, instead
  we need to engage all levels of information, low, middle, and high, in order to
  decide where to put edges. In this paper we propose a novel supervised learning
  algorithm for edge and object boundary detection which we refer to as Boosted Edge
  Learning or BEL for short. A decision of an edge point is made independently at
  each location in the image; a very large aperture is used providing significant
  context for each decision. In the learning stage, the algorithm selects and combines
  a large number of features across different scales in order to learn a discriminative
  model using an extended version of the Probabilistic Boosting Tree classification
  algorithm. The learning based framework is highly adaptive and there are no parameters
  to tune. We show applications for edge detection in a number of specific image domains
  as well as on natural images. We test on various datasets including the Berkeley
  dataset and the results obtained are very good.
