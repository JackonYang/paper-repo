paperAbstract: 'We present a novel algorithm for recovering a smooth manifold of unknown
  dimension and topology from a set of points known to belong to it. Numerous applications
  in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental
  problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced
  to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications.
  As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous
  setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This
  method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one
  another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested
  method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean,
  which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial
  differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit
  representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring
  points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful
  since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology,
  embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall
  present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two
  different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images.'
