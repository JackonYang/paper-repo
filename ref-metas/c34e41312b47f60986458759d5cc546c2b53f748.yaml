paperAbstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is one of the basic natural language processing
  (NLP) problems. To this date, most of the successful SRL systems were built on top
  of some form of parsing results (Koomen et al., 2005; Palmer et al., 2010; Pradhan
  et al., 2013), where pre-defined feature templates over the syntactic structure
  are used. The attempts of building an end-to-end SRL learning system without using
  parsing were less successful (Collobert et al., 2011). In this work, we propose
  to use deep bi-directional recurrent network as an end-to-end system for SRL. We
  take only original text information as input feature, without using any syntactic
  knowledge. The proposed algorithm for semantic role labeling was mainly evaluated
  on CoNLL-2005 shared task and achieved F1 score of 81.07. This result outperforms
  the previous state-of-the-art system from the combination of different parsing trees
  or models. We also obtained the same conclusion with F1 = 81.27 on CoNLL2012 shared
  task. As a result of simplicity, our model is also computationally efficient that
  the parsing speed is 6.7k tokens per second. Our analysis shows that our model is
  better at handling longer sentences than traditional models. And the latent variables
  of our model implicitly capture the syntactic structure of a sentence.
