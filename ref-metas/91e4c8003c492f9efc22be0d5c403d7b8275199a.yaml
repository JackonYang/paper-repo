paperAbstract: "Classifying materials from their appearance is a challenging problem,\
  \ especially if illumination and pose conditions are permitted to change: highlights\
  \ and shadows caused by 3D structure can radically alter a sample\u2019s visual\
  \ texture. Despite these difficulties, researchers have demonstrated impressive\
  \ results on the CUReT database which contains many images of 61 materials under\
  \ different conditions. A first contribution of this paper is to further advance\
  \ the state-of-the-art by applying Support Vector Machines to this problem. To our\
  \ knowledge, we record the best results to date on the CUReT database."
