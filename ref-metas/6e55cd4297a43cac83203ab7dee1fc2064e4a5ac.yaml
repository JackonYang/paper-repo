paperAbstract: In various application domains, including image recognition, it is
  natural to represent each example as a set of vectors. With a base kernel we can
  implicitly map these vectors to a Hilbert space and fit a Gaussian distribution
  to the whole set using Kernel PCA. We define our kernel between examples as Bhattacharyya's
  measure of affinity between such Gaussians. The resulting kernel is computable in
  closed form and enjoys many favorable properties, including graceful behavior under
  transformations, potentially justifying the vector set representation even in cases
  when more conventional representations also exist.
