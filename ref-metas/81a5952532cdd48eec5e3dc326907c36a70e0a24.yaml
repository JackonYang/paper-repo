paperAbstract: 'A vector quantizer is a system for mapping a sequence of continuous
  or discrete vectors into a digital sequence suitable for communication over or storage
  in a digital channel. The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the
  bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory
  requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for
  each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions
  of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has
  no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory
  implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead
  of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression
  system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate
  is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed
  for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have
  been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes
  has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors,
  images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article
  to survey some of these design techniques and their applications.'
