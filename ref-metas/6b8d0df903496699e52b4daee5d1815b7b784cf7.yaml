paperAbstract: 'Recent object detection systems rely on two critical steps: (1) a
  set of object proposals is predicted as efficiently as possible, and (2) this set
  of candidate proposals is then passed to an object classifier. Such approaches have
  been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance.
  In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an
  approach based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly
  with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs
  a class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs
  the likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model
  is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation
  masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score.
  We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object
  proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains
  substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our
  model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during training.
  Unlike all previous approaches for generating object masks, we do not rely on edges,
  superpixels, or any other form of low-level segmentation.'
