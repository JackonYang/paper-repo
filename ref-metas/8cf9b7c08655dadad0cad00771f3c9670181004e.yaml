paperAbstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize a constituent boundary
  parsing algorithm, using an information-theoretic measure called generalized mutual
  information, which serves as an alternative to traditional grammar-based parsing
  methods. This method is based on the hypothesis that constituent boundaries can
  be extracted from a given sentence (or word sequence) by analyzing the mutual information
  values of the part of speech n-grams within the sentence. This hypothesis is supported
  by the performance of an implementation of this parsing algorithm which determines
  a recursive unlabeled bracketing of unrestricted English text with a relatively
  low error rate. This paper derives the generalized mutual information statistic,
  describes the parsing algorithm, and presents results and sample output from the
  parser.
