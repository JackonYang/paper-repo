paperAbstract: As visual recognition scales up to ever larger numbers of categories,
  maintaining high accuracy is increasingly difficult. In this work, we study the
  problem of optimizing accuracy-specificity trade-offs in large scale recognition,
  motivated by the observation that object categories form a semantic hierarchy consisting
  of many levels of abstraction. A classifier can select the appropriate level, trading
  off specificity for accuracy in case of uncertainty. By optimizing this trade-off,
  we obtain classifiers that try to be as specific as possible while guaranteeing
  an arbitrarily high accuracy. We formulate the problem as maximizing information
  gain while ensuring a fixed, arbitrarily small error rate with a semantic hierarchy.
  We propose the Dual Accuracy Reward Trade-off Search (DARTS) algorithm and prove
  that, under practical conditions, it converges to an optimal solution. Experiments
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on datasets ranging from 65 to over
  10,000 categories.
