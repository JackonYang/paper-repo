paperAbstract: Entity linking is an indispensable operation of populating knowledge
  repositories for information extraction. It studies on aligning a textual entity
  mention to its corresponding disambiguated entry in a knowledge repository. In this
  paper, we propose a new paradigm named distantly supervised entity linking (DSEL),
  in the sense that the disambiguated entities that belong to a huge knowledge repository
  (Freebase) are automatically aligned to the corresponding descriptive webpages (Wiki
  pages). In this way, a large scale of weakly labeled data can be generated without
  manual annotation and fed to a classifier for linking more newly discovered entities.
  Compared with traditional paradigms based on solo knowledge base, DSEL benefits
  more via jointly leveraging the respective advantages of Freebase and Wikipedia.
  Specifically, the proposed paradigm facilitates bridging the disambiguated labels
  (Freebase) of entities and their textual descriptions (Wikipedia) for Web-scale
  entities. Experiments conducted on a dataset of 140,000 items and 60,000 features
  achieve a baseline F1-measure of 0.517. Furthermore, we analyze the feature performance
  and improve the F1-measure to 0.545.
