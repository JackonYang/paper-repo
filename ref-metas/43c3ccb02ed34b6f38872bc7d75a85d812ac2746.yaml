paperAbstract: Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted considerable attention
  recently owing to its various advanced applications such as document understanding,
  automatic marking and intelligent education. Most existing works decoupled this
  problem into several independent sub-tasks of text spotting (text detection and
  recognition) and information extraction, which completely ignored the high correlation
  among them during optimization. In this paper, we propose a robust visual information
  extraction system (VIES) towards real-world scenarios, which is an unified end-to-end
  trainable framework for simultaneous text detection, recognition and information
  extraction by taking a single document image as input and outputting the structured
  information. Specifically, the information extraction branch collects abundant visual
  and semantic representations from text spotting for multimodal feature fusion and
  conversely, provides higherlevel semantic clues to contribute to the optimization
  of text spotting. Moreover, regarding the shortage of public benchmarks, we construct
  a fully-annotated dataset called EPHOIE (https://github.com/HCIILAB/EPHOIE), which
  is the first Chinese benchmark for both text spotting and visual information extraction.
  EPHOIE consists of 1,494 images of examination paper head with complex layouts and
  background, including a total of 15,771 Chinese handwritten or printed text instances.
  Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our VIES shows significant superior
  performance on the EPHOIE dataset and achieves a 9.01% F-score gain on the widely
  used SROIE dataset under the end-to-end scenario.
