paperAbstract: This paper presents an efficient shape-based object detection method
  based on Distance Transforms and describes its use for real-time vision on-board
  vehicles. The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object
  shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions
  using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching
  involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over
  the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained
  when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have
  measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results
  on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle.
  Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss
  some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism
  is concerned.
