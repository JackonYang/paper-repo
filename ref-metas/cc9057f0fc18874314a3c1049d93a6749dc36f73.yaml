paperAbstract: "This experiment demonstrates the influence of the prior presentation\
  \ of visual scenes on the identification of briefly presented drawings of real-world\
  \ objects. Different pairings of objects and scenes were used to produce three main\
  \ contextual conditions: appropriate, inappropriate, and no context. Correct responses\
  \ and confusions with visually similar objects depended strongly on both the contextual\
  \ condition and the particular target object presented. The probability of being\
  \ correct was highest in the appropriate context condition and lowest in the inappropriate\
  \ context condition. Confidence ratings of responses were a function of the perceptual\
  \ similarity between the stimulus object and the named object; they were not strongly\
  \ affected by contextual conditions. Morton\u2019s (1970) \u201Clogogen\u201D model\
  \ provided a good quantitative fit to the response probability data."
