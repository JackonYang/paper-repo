paperAbstract: A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory
  coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two
  strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the
  environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as
  a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input
  to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error.
  This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is
  related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent
  papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes
  will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina
  and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding
  schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells
  in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system
  is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined
  in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in
  the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have
  a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality
  is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy
  of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code
  is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis).
  In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak
  when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual
  cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because
  the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when
  presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that
  allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested
  that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar
  local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems
  would evolve toward sparse coding are presented.
