paperAbstract: An adaptive neural network with asymmetric connections is introduced.
  This network is related to the Hopfield network with graded neurons and uses a recurrent
  generalization of the \ensuremath{\delta} rule of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams
  to modify adaptively the synaptic weights. The new network bears a resemblance to
  the master/slave network of Lapedes and Farber but it is architecturally simpler.
