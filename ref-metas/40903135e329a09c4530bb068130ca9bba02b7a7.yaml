paperAbstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds
  of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information.
  "Clean labels" can be manually obtained on a small fraction, "noisy labels" may
  be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are
  no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining
  these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of
  images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions
  of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent
  results in machine learning to obtain highly efficient approximations for semi-supervised
  learning that are linear in the number of images. Specifically, we use the convergence
  of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted
  Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning
  to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet.
