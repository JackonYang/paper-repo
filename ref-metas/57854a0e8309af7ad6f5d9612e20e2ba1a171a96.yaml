paperAbstract: We describe a novel algorithm for gait analysis. A person walking frontoparallel
  to the image plane generates a characteristic "braided" pattern in a spatiotemporal
  (XYT) volume. Our algorithm detects this pattern, and fits it with a set of spatiotemporal
  snakes. The snakes can be used to find the bounding contours of the walker. The
  contours vary over time in a manner characteristic of each walker. Individual gaits
  can be recognized by applying standard pattern recognition techniques to the contour
  signals.<<ETX>>
