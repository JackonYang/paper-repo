paperAbstract: "Multi-class image segmentation has made significant advances in recent\
  \ years through the combination of local and global features. One important type\
  \ of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying\
  \ \u201Ctree\u201D pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more\
  \ likely to be \u201Csky\u201D whereas pixels below are more likely to be \u201C\
  grass.\u201D Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between\
  \ all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence,\
  \ cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information\
  \ from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We\
  \ employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we\
  \ generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature\
  \ from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with\
  \ appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results\
  \ to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases\
  \ and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to\
  \ significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art."
