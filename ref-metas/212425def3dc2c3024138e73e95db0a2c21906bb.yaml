paperAbstract: We present a 3-level hierarchical model for localizing human bodies
  in still images from arbitrary viewpoints. We first fit a simple tree-structured
  model defined on a small landmark set along the body contours by Dynamic Programming
  (DP). The output is a series of proposal maps that encode the probabilities of partial
  body configurations. Next, we fit a mixture of view-dependent models by Sequential
  Monte Carlo (SMC), which handles self-occlusion, anthropometric constraints, and
  large viewpoint changes. DP and SMC are designed to search in opposite directions
  such that the DP proposals are utilized effectively to initialize and guide the
  SMC inference. This hybrid strategy of combining deterministic and stochastic search
  ensures both the robustness and efficiency of DP, and the accuracy of SMC. Finally,
  we fit an expanded mixture model with increased landmark density through local optimization.
  The model hierarchy is trained on a large number of gait images. Extensive tests
  on cluttered images with varying poses including walking, dancing and various types
  of sports activities demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
