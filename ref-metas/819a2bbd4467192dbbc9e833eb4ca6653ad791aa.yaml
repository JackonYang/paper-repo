paperAbstract: We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition
  of object classes from unsegmented cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as flexible
  constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator.
  For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features
  is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF
  framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs
  into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the
  CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by
  finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed
  CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence
  of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches,
  an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object
  classes.
