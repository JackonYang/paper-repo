paperAbstract: This paper describes an algorithm for verification of signatures written
  on a pen-input tablet. The algorithm is based on a novel, artificial neural network,
  called a "Siamese" neural network. This network consists of two identical sub-networks
  joined at their outputs. During training the two sub-networks extract features from
  two signatures, while the joining neuron measures the distance between the two feature
  vectors. Verification consists of comparing an extracted feature vector with a stored
  feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer to this stored representation than
  a chosen threshold are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries.
