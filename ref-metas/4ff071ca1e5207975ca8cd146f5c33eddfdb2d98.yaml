paperAbstract: A model-based method for analyzing a human body motion is presented.
  The method is based on a robot arm model which represents a human body motion. Combining
  the model and the gradient scheme, the movement of the configuration of the model
  (Human) can be directly estimated from an image sequence.<<ETX>>
