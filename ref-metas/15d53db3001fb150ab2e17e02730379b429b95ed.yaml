paperAbstract: Efficient detection of objects in images is complicated by variations
  of object appearance due to intra-class object differences, articulation, lighting,
  occlusions, and aspect variations. To reduce the search required for detection,
  we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate
  some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections
  of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a
  small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient
  correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these
  goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features,
  relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured
  in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown
  that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure,
  in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not
  required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection.
  We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish
  an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation
  of a face.
