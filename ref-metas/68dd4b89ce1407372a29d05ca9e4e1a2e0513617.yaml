paperAbstract: How do people know as much as they do with as little information as
  they get? The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially
  dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity
  and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used
  to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena.
  By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large
  body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of
  English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or
  perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning
  method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of
  dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories,
  phenomena, and problems are sketched.
