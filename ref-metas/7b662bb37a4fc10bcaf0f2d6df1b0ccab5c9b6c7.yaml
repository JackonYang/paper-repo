paperAbstract: 'There has been an increase of interest for semi-supervised learning
  recently, because of the many datasets with large amounts of unlabeled examples
  and only a few labeled ones. This paper follows up on proposed non-parametric algorithms
  which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabeled examples. It
  extends them to function induction algorithms that correspond to the minimization
  of a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happens to
  have the form of a Parzen windows regressor. The advantage of the extension is that
  it allows predicting the label for a new example without having to solve again a
  linear system of dimension ''n'' (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples),
  which can cost O(n^3). Experiments show that the extension works well, in the sense
  of predicting a label close to the one that would have been obtained if the test
  example had been included in the unlabeled set. This relatively efficient function
  induction procedure can also be used when ''n'' is large to approximate the solution
  by writing it only in terms of a kernel expansion with ''m'' Keywords: non-parametric
