paperAbstract: Document structure analysis, such as zone segmentation and table recognition,
  is a complex problem in document processing and is an active area of research. The
  recent success of deep learning in solving various computer vision and machine learning
  problems has not been reflected in document structure analysis since conventional
  neural networks are not well suited to the input structure of the problem. In this
  paper, we propose an architecture based on graph networks as a better alternative
  to standard neural networks for table recognition. We argue that graph networks
  are a more natural choice for these problems, and explore two gradient-based graph
  neural networks. Our proposed architecture combines the benefits of convolutional
  neural networks for visual feature extraction and graph networks for dealing with
  the problem structure. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms the
  baseline by a significant margin. In addition, we identify the lack of large scale
  datasets as a major hindrance for deep learning research for structure analysis
  and present a new large scale synthetic dataset for the problem of table recognition.
  Finally, we open-source our implementation of dataset generation and the training
  framework of our graph networks to promote reproducible research in this direction.
