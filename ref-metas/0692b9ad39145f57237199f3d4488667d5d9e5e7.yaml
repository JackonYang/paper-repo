paperAbstract: "The rise of \u201CBig Data\u201D analytics over unstructured text\
  \ has led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE). We surveyed the landscape\
  \ of IE technologies and identified a major disconnect between industry and academia:\
  \ while rule-based IE dominates the commercial world, it is widely regarded as dead-end\
  \ technology by the academia. We believe the disconnect stems from the way in which\
  \ the two communities measure the benefits and costs of IE, as well as academia\u2019\
  s perception that rulebased IE is devoid of research challenges. We make a case\
  \ for the importance of rule-based IE to industry practitioners. We then lay out\
  \ a research agenda in advancing the state-of-theart in rule-based IE systems which\
  \ we believe has the potential to bridge the gap between academic research and industry\
  \ practice."
