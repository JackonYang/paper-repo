paperAbstract: Simple sets of parallel operations are described which can be used
  to detect texture edges, "spots," and "streaks" in digitized pictures. It is shown
  that, by comparing the outputs of the operations corresponding to (e.g.,) edges
  of different sizes, one can construct a composite output in which edges between
  differently textured regions are detected, and isolated objects are also detected,
  but the objects composing the textures are ignored. Relationships between this class
  of picture processing operations and the Gestalt psychologists' laws of pictorial
  pattern organization are also discussed.
