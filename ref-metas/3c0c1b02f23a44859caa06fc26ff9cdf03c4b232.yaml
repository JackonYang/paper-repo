paperAbstract: This paper describes a framework for learning probabilistic models
  of objects and scenes and for exploiting these models for tracking complex, deformable,
  or articulated objects in image sequences. We focus on the probabilistic tracking
  of people and learn models of how they appear and move in images. In particular
  we learn the likelihood of observing various spatial and temporal filter responses
  corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion differences given a model of the person.
  Similarly, we learn probability distributions over filter responses for general
  scenes that define a likelihood of observing the filter responses for arbitrary
  backgrounds. We then derive a probabilistic model for tracking that exploits the
  ratio between the likelihood that image pixels corresponding to the foreground (person)
  were generated by an actual person or by some unknown background. The paper extends
  previous work on learning image statistics and combines it with Bayesian tracking
  using particle filtering. By combining multiple image cues, and by using learned
  likelihood models, we demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy when tracking
  complex objects such as people in monocular image sequences with cluttered scene
  and a moving camera.
