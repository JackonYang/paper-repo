paperAbstract: "The details of EM algorithms for maximum likelihood factor analysis\
  \ are presented for both the exploratory and confirmatory models. The algorithm\
  \ is essentially the same for both cases and involves only simple least squares\
  \ regression operations; the largest matrix inversion required is for aq \xD7q symmetric\
  \ matrix whereq is the matrix of factors. The example that is used demonstrates\
  \ that the likelihood for the factor analysis model may have multiple modes that\
  \ are not simply rotations of each other; such behavior should concern users of\
  \ maximum likelihood factor analysis and certainly should cast doubt on the general\
  \ utility of second derivatives of the log likelihood as measures of precision of\
  \ estimation."
