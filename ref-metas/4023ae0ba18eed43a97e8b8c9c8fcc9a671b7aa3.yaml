paperAbstract: First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory
  impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive,
  process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several
  dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at
  least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is
  a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention
  than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people
  do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures
  are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists
  and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation
  than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has
  contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques
  can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found.
  And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what
  now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts
  and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of
  getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for
  calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects.
  In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information
  measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this
  paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational
  concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language;
  they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been
  proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions
  that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look.
  In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting.
  And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of
  the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in
  the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary
  colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What
  about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment,
  the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of
  immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there
  is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out
  for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.
