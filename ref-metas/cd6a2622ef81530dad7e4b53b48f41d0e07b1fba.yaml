paperAbstract: Based on a study of the extensive literature in handprint recognition,
  this paper presents a survey in this challenging field. Recognition algorithms,
  data bases, character models, and handprint standards are examined. Achievements
  in the recognition of handprinted numerals, alphanumerics, Fortran, and Katakana
  characters are analyzed and compared. Data quality and constraints, as well as human
  and machine factors are also described. Characteristics, problems, and actual results
  on on-line recognition of handprinted characters for different applications are
  discussed. New emphases and directions are suggested.
