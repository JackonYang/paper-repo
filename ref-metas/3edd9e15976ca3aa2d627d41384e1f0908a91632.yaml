paperAbstract: We investigate the problem of learning optimal descriptors for a given
  classification task. Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature
  for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes
  one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative
  power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single
  descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning
  the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior
  constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the
  optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to
  base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance,
  rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a
  convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for
  efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
  UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets.
