paperAbstract: "This paper reports the first phase of a research program on visual\
  \ perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms in locomotion.\
  \ Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion.\
  \ They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns\
  \ of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday\
  \ perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding\
  \ figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method\
  \ for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with\
  \ the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented\
  \ by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that\
  \ 10\u201312 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus\
  \ evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric\
  \ model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception\
  \ of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological\
  \ motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally\
  \ tested and the results turned out to be highly positive."
