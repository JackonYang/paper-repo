paperAbstract: The kind of application that the text categorization shell, TCS, can
  produce is characterized. Many of its applications have great commercial value.
  The design goals for TCS are discussed, and other approaches to text categorization
  in the light of these goals are examined. The TCS and how it meets its design goals
  are described, and examples of applications built with TCS are given. A text-categorization
  application developed with TCS consists of the TCS run-time system and a rule base.
  The rule base defines what categories the application can assign to texts and contains
  rules that make the categorization decisions for particular texts. The data-driven
  nature of TCS allows it is to satisfy fully the requirements of ease of application
  development, portability to other applications and maintainability.<<ETX>>
