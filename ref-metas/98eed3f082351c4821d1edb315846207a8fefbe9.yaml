paperAbstract: We consider two algorithm for on-line prediction based on a linear
  model. The algorithms are the well-known Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and a new
  algorithm, which we call EG(+/-). They both maintain a weight vector using simple
  updates. For the GD algorithm, the update is based on subtracting the gradient of
  the squared error made on a prediction. The EG(+/-) algorithm uses the components
  of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight
  vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case loss bounds for EG(+/-) and compare
  them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that the
  losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, but EG(+/-) has a much smaller
  loss if only a few components of the input are relevant for the predictions. We
  have performed experiments, which show that our worst-case upper bounds are quite
  tight already on simple artificial data.
