paperAbstract: Viewers briefly glimpsed pictures presented in a sequence at rates
  up to eight per second. They recognized a target picture as accurately and almost
  as rapidly when they knew only its meaning given by a name (for example, a boat)
  as when they had seen the picture itself in advance.
