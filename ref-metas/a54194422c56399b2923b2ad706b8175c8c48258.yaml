paperAbstract: In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the
  signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the
  discrete nature assumed until now. To a considerable extent the continuous case
  can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the
  continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions
  and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size
  of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper
  values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear
  and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the
  general results to particular cases.
