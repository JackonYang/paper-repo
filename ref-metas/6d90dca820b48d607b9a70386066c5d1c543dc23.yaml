paperAbstract: We present a method based on statistical properties of local image
  pixels for focussing attention on regions of text in arbitrary scenes where the
  text plane is not necessarily fronto-parallel to the camera. This is particularly
  useful for desktop or wearable computing applications. The statistical measures
  are chosen to reveal characteristic properties of text. We combine a number of localised
  measures using a neural network to classify each pixel as text or non-text. We demonstrate
  our results on typical images.
