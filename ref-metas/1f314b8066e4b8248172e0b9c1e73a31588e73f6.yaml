paperAbstract: Novel techniques are described for model-based recognition of 3-D objects
  from unknown viewpoints using single-gray-scale images. The objects in the scene
  may be overlapping and partially occluded. Efficient matching algorithms, which
  assume affine approximation to the perspective viewing transformation, are proposed.
  The study is currently restricted to flat rigid 3-D objects. Point, line and curve
  matching algorithms are presented. The study especially emphasizes the curve matching
  problem. Experimental results are included.<<ETX>>
