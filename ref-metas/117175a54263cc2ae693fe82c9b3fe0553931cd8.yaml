paperAbstract: 'Properties of the receptive fields of simple cells in macaque cortex
  were compared with properties of independent component filters generated by independent
  component analysis (ICA) on a large set of natural images. Histograms of spatial
  frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the
  receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to
  the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated
  and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters
  produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but
  are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible
  ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed.'
