paperAbstract: 'The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex
  of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic
  evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than
  converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends
  not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly
  varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate
  nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under
  quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity
  of the neuron''s integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form
  for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when
  the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in
  a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system
  converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space.
  We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and
  binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate
  form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what
  is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular
  input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with
  the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory
  further.'
