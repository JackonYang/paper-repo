paperAbstract: 'Abstract

  In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering
  algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear
  algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such
  as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly
  mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really
  does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We
  describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most
  common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch
  by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral
  clustering algorithms are discussed.
