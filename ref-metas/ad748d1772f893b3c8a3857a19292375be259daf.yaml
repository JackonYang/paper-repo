paperAbstract: Image-text matching is a vital cross-modality task in artificial intelligence
  and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing works have shown
  that learning semantic concepts is useful to enhance image representation and can
  significantly improve the performance of both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval.
  However, existing models simply detect semantic concepts from a given image, which
  are less likely to deal with long-tail and occlusion concepts. Frequently co-occurred
  concepts in the same scene, e.g. bedroom and bed, can provide common-sense knowledge
  to discover other semantic-related concepts. In this paper, we develop a Scene Concept
  Graph (SCG) by aggregating image scene graphs and extracting frequently co-occurred
  concept pairs as scene common-sense knowledge. Moreover, we propose a novel model
  to incorporate this knowledge to improve image-text matching. Specifically, semantic
  concepts are detected from images and then expanded by the SCG. After learning to
  select relevant contextual concepts, we fuse their representations with the image
  embedding feature to feed into the matching module. Extensive experiments are conducted
  on Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets, and prove that our model achieves state-of-the-art
  results due to the effectiveness of incorporating the external SCG.
