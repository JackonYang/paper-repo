paperAbstract: "There is an ever increasing number of publications which do not have\
  \ the \u201Ctraditional\u201D layout where printed regions are rectangular. Text\
  \ paragraphs and areas of graphic type may be of any shape, individually rotated\
  \ and in any arrangement. Previous document analysis techniques are not well suited\
  \ to such complex layouts. This paper introduces a new method for the segmentation\
  \ of images of document pages having both traditional and complex layouts. The underlining\
  \ idea is to efficiently produce a flexible description (by means of tiles) of the\
  \ background space which surrounds the printed regions in the page image under all\
  \ the above conditions. Using this description of space, the contours of printed\
  \ regions are identified with significant accuracy. The new approach is fast as\
  \ there is no need for skew detection and correction, and only few simple operations\
  \ are performed on the description of the background (not on the pixel-based data)."
