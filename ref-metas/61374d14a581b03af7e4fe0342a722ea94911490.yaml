paperAbstract: This paper presents a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic
  processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results.
  The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic
  preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions
  concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are
  proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present
  paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production
  experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's
  sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the
  effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben,
  and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and
  Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967)
  proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried
  to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension
  (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two
  or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The
  effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms
  of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory
  to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure
  and processing into a computer.
