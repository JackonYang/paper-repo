paperAbstract: Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace-Beltrami
  operator on a manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically
  motivated algorithm for constructing a representation for data sampled from a low
  dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The algorithm provides
  a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that
  has locality preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Several
  applications are considered.
