paperAbstract: "This paper deals with finite networks which consist of interconnections\
  \ of synchronously evolving processors. Each processor updates its state by applying\
  \ a \u201Csigmoidal\u201D scalar nonlinearity to a linear combination of the previous\
  \ states of all units. We prove that one may simulate all Turing Machines by rational\
  \ nets. In particular, one can do this in linear time, and there is a net made up\
  \ of about 1,000 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function.\
  \ Products (high order nets) are not required, contrary to what had been stated\
  \ in the literature. Furthermore, we assert a similar theorem about non-deterministic\
  \ Turing Machines. Consequences for undecidability and complexity issues about nets\
  \ are discussed too."
