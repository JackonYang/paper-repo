paperAbstract: We try to address the problem of document layout understanding using
  a simple algorithm which generalizes across multiple domains while training on just
  few examples per domain. We approach this problem via supervised object detection
  method and propose a methodology to overcome the requirement of large datasets.
  We use the concept of transfer learning by pre-training our object detector on a
  simple artificial (source) dataset and fine-tuning it on a tiny domain specific
  (target) dataset. We show that this methodology works for multiple domains with
  training samples as less as 10 documents. We demonstrate the effect of each component
  of the methodology in the end result and show the superiority of this methodology
  over simple object detectors.
