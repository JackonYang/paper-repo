paperAbstract: We present a feed-forward network architecture for recognizing an unconstrained
  handwritten multi-digit string. This is an extension of previous work on recognizing
  isolated digits. In this architecture a single digit recognizer is replicated over
  the input. The output layer of the network is coupled to a Viterbi alignment module
  that chooses the best interpretation of the input. Training errors are propagated
  through the Viterbi module. The novelty in this procedure is that segmentation is
  done on the feature maps developed in the Space Displacement Neural Network (SDNN)
  rather than the input (pixel) space.
