paperAbstract: "The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process\
  \ in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into\
  \ an arrangement of simple geometric components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges,\
  \ and cones. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components\
  \ (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \xA3\
  \ 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges\
  \ in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and\
  \ cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing\
  \ position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when\
  \ the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides\
  \ a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic\
  \ principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints\
  \ toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the\
  \ object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free\
  \ combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for\
  \ the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons\
  \ can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they\
  \ are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from\
  \ experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers\
  \ provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity\
  \ of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer\
  \ can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection.\
  \ The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed\
  \ behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image\
  \ but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be\
  \ missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But\
  \ it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily\
  \ classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance\
  \ that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."
