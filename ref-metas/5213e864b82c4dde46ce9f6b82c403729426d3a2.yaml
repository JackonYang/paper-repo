paperAbstract: The inferencing task of figuring out words from context is implemented
  in the presence of a large database of world knowledge. The program does not require
  interaction with the user, but rather uses internal parser expectations and knowledge
  embodied in scripts to figure out likely definitions for unknown words, and to create
  context-specific definitions for such words.
