paperAbstract: "We investigate the power of threshold circuits of small depth. In\
  \ particular, we give functions that require exponential size unweighted threshold\
  \ circuits of depth 3 when we restrict the bottom fanin. We also prove that there\
  \ are monotone functionsfk that can be computed in depthk and linear size \u22CE\
  , \u22CF-circuits but require exponential size to compute by a depthk\u22121 monotone\
  \ weighted threshold circuit."
