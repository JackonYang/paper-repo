paperAbstract: "Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently\
  \ achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks.\
  \ While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to\
  \ learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties.\
  \ In this paper we report two such properties. \nFirst, we find that there is no\
  \ distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations\
  \ of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests\
  \ that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic\
  \ information in the high layers of neural networks. \nSecond, we find that deep\
  \ neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a\
  \ significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying\
  \ a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's\
  \ prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not\
  \ a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network,\
  \ that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same\
  \ input."
