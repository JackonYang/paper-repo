paperAbstract: During the last decade national archives, libraries, museums and companies
  started to make their records, books and files electronically available. In order
  to allow efficient access of this information, the content of the documents must
  be stored in database and information retrieval systems. State-of-the-art indexing
  techniques mostly rely on the information explicitly available in the text portions
  of documents. Documents usually contain a significant amount of implicit information
  such as their logical structure which is not directly accessible (unless the documents
  are available as well-structured XML-files) and is therefore not used in the search
  process. In this paper, a new approach for analyzing the logical structure of text
  documents is presented. The problem of state-of-the-art methods is that they have
  been developed for a particular type of documents and can only handle documents
  of that type. In most cases, adaptation and re-training for a different document
  type is not possible. Our proposed method allows an efficient and effective adaptation
  of the structure analysis process by combining state-of-the-art machine learning
  with novel interactive visualization techniques, allowing a quick adaptation of
  the structure analysis process to unknown document classes and new tasks without
  requiring a predefined training set.
