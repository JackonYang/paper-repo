paperAbstract: Research on ways to extend and improve query methods for image databases
  is widespread. We have developed the QBIC (Query by Image Content) system to explore
  content-based retrieval methods. QBIC allows queries on large image and video databases
  based on example images, user-constructed sketches and drawings, selected color
  and texture patterns, camera and object motion, and other graphical information.
  Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable
  properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in
  the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by
  drawing, selecting and other graphical means. This article describes the QBIC system
  and demonstrates its query capabilities. QBIC technology is part of several IBM
  products. >
