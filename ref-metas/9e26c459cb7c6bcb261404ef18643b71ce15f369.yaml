paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose a framework for isolating text regions from
  natural scene images. The main algorithm has two functions: it generates text region
  candidates, and it verifies of the label of the candidates (text or non-text). The
  text region candidates are generated through a modified K-means clustering algorithm,
  which references texture features, edge information and color information. The candidate
  labels are then verified in a global sense by the Markov Random Field model where
  collinearity weight is added as long as most texts are aligned. The proposed method
  achieves reasonable accuracy for text extraction from moderately difficult examples
  from the ICDAR 2003 database.'
