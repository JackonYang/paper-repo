paperAbstract: 'Abstract

  This paper presents a novel method for detecting and localizing objects of a visual
  category in cluttered real-world scenes. Our approach considers object categorization
  and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate
  towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two
  processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance.


  The core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object
  shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in
  a probabilistic extension of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach
  can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic
  segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used
  to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object
  pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information
  from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based
  hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses
  and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.


  An extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the proposed system
  is applicable to a range of different object categories, including both rigid and
  articulated objects. In addition, its flexible representation allows it to achieve
  competitive object detection performance already from training sets that are between
  one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable systems.
