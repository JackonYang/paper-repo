paperAbstract: "Tables form an important kind of data element in text retrieval. Often,\
  \ the gist of an entire news article or other exposition can be concisely captured\
  \ in tabular form. In this paper, we examine the utility of exploiting information\
  \ other than the key words in a digital document to provide the users with more\
  \ flexible and powerful query capabilities. More specifically, we exploit the structural\
  \ information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let\
  \ the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated\
  \ that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed\
  \ effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the\
  \ TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate\
  \ better representation of user\u2019s information needs and hence more effective\
  \ retrieval of tables."
