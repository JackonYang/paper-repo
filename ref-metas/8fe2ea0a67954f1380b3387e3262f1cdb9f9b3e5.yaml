paperAbstract: The fabric comprises a novel type of netting which will have particular
  utility in screening out mosquitoes and like insects and pests. The fabric is defined
  of voids having depth as well as width and length. The fabric is usable as a material
  from which to form clothing for wear, or bed coverings, or sleeping bags, etc.,
  besides use simply as a netting.
