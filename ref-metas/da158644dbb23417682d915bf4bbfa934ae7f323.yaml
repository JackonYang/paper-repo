paperAbstract: "An arbitrary square integrable real-valued function (or, equivalently,\
  \ the associated Hardy function) can be conveniently analyzed into a suitable family\
  \ of square integrable wavelets of constant shape, (i.e. obtained by shifts and\
  \ dilations from any one of them.) The resulting integral transform is isometric\
  \ and self-reciprocal if the wavelets satisfy an \u201Cadmissibility condition\u201D\
  \ given here. Explicit expressions are obtained in the case of a particular analyzing\
  \ family that plays a role analogous to that of coherent states (Gabor wavelets)\
  \ in the usual $L_2 $ -theory. They are written in terms of a modified $\\Gamma\
  \ $-function that is introduced and studied. From the point of view of group theory,\
  \ this paper is concerned with square integrable coefficients of an irreducible\
  \ representation of the nonunimodular $ax + b$-group."
