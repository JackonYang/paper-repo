paperAbstract: "Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused\
  \ on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that can fit into\
  \ the memory of a desktop (typically 4G\u223C48G). There are two main reasons for\
  \ the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence\
  \ of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark\
  \ data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive\
  \ to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges\
  \ than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency\
  \ in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance.\
  \ This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as\
  \ an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature\
  \ extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly\
  \ sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million\
  \ images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic\
  \ gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM\
  \ classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training\
  \ data and converges very fast\u2013typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result,\
  \ we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification,\
  \ i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate."
