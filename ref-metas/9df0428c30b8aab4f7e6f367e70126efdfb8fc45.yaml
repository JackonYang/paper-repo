paperAbstract: 'A system capable of analyzing image sequences of human motion is described.
  The system is structured as a feedback loop between high and low levels: predictions
  are made at the semantic level and verifications are sought at the image level.
  The domain of human motion lends itself to a model-driven analysis, and the system
  includes a detailed model of the human body. All information extracted from the
  image is interpreted through a constraint network based on the structure of the
  human model. A constraint propagation operator is defined and its theoretical properties
  outlined. An implementation of this operator is described, and results of the analysis
  system for short image sequences are presented.'
