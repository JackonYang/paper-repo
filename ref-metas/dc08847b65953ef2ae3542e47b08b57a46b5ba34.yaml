paperAbstract: High-level, or holistic, scene understanding involves reasoning about
  objects, regions, and the 3D relationships between them. This requires a representation
  above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as
  class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene.
  Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and
  scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions.
  Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance
  and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present
  an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of
  the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our
  method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image
  segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and
  geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of
  the scene.
