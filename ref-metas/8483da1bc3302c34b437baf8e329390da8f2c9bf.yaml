paperAbstract: 'Sliding window classifiers are among the most successful and widely
  applied techniques for object localization. However, training is typically done
  in a way that is not specific to the localization task. First a binary classifier
  is trained using a sample of positive and negative examples, and this classifier
  is subsequently applied to multiple regions within test images. We propose instead
  to treat object localization in a principled way by posing it as a problem of predicting
  structured data: we model the problem not as binary classification, but as the prediction
  of the bounding box of objects located in images. The use of a joint-kernelframework
  allows us to formulate the training procedure as a generalization of an SVM, which
  can be solved efficiently. We further improve computational efficiency by using
  a branch-and-bound strategy for localization during both training and testing. Experimental
  evaluation on the PASCAL VOC and TU Darmstadt datasets show that the structured
  training procedure improves performance over binary training as well as the best
  previously published scores.'
