paperAbstract: Image content based retrieval is emerging as an important research
  area with application to digital libraries and multimedia databases. The focus of
  this paper is on the image processing aspects and in particular using texture information
  for browsing and retrieval of large image data. We propose the use of Gabor wavelet
  features for texture analysis and provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation.
  Comparisons with other multiresolution texture features using the Brodatz texture
  database indicate that the Gabor features provide the best pattern retrieval accuracy.
  An application to browsing large air photos is illustrated.
