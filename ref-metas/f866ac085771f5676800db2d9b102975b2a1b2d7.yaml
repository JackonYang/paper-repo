paperAbstract: A hybrid method for continuous-speech recognition which combines hidden
  Markov models (HMMs) and a connectionist technique called connectionist Viterbi
  training (CVT) is presented. CVT can be run iteratively and can be applied to large-vocabulary
  recognition tasks. Successful completion of training the connectionist component
  of the system, despite the large network size and volume of training data, depends
  largely on several measures taken to reduce learning time. The system is trained
  and tested on the TI/NBS speaker-independent continuous-digits database. Performance
  on test data for unknown-length strings is 98.5% word accuracy and 95.0% string
  accuracy. Several improvements to the current system are expected to increase these
  accuracies significantly.<<ETX>>
