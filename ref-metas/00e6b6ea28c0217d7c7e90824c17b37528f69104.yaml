paperAbstract: Systems that are competitive and possess symmetric interactions admit
  a global Lyapunov function. However, a global Lyapunov function whose equilibrium
  set can be effectively analyzed has not yet been discovered. It remains an open
  question whether the Lyapunov function approach, which requires a study of equilibrium
  points, or an alternative global approach, such as the Lyapunov functional approach,
  which sidesteps a direct study of equilibrium points will ultimately handle all
  of the physically important cases.
