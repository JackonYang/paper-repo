paperAbstract: Partitioned sampling is a technique which was introduced in [I7] for
  avoiding the high cost of particle filters when tracking more than one object. In
  fact this technique can reduce the curse of dimensionality in other situations too.
  This paper describes how to use partitioned sampling on articulated objects, obtaining
  results that would be impossible with standard sampling methods. Because partitioned
  sampling is the statistical analogue of a hierarchical search, it makes sense to
  use it on articulated objects, since links at the base of the object can be localised
  before moving on to search for subsequent links.
