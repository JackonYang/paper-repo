paperAbstract: Texture perception has frequently been studied using textures constructed
  by repeated placement of micropatterns or texture elements. Theories have been developed
  to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features
  within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region
  filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts
  but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution
  of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However,
  Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one
  filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented
  line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be
  based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections
  within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for
  size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying
  the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned
  mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned
  responses they are easy to discriminate.
