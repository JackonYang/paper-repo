paperAbstract: It has become common in statistical studies of natural language data
  to use measures of lexical association, such as the information-theoretic measure
  of mutual information, to extract useful relationships between words (e.g. [Church
  et al., 1989; Church and Hanks, 1989; Hindle, 1990]). For example, [Hindle, 1990]
  uses an estimate of mutual information to calculate what nouns a verb can take as
  its subjects and objects, based on distributions found within a large corpus of
  naturally occurring text.
