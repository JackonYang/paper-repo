paperAbstract: "A general method for text localization and recognition in real-world\
  \ images is presented. The proposed method is novel, as it (i) departs from a strict\
  \ feed-forward pipeline and replaces it by a hypothesesverification framework simultaneously\
  \ processing multiple text line hypotheses, (ii) uses synthetic fonts to train the\
  \ algorithm eliminating the need for time-consuming acquisition and labeling of\
  \ real-world training data and (iii) exploits Maximally Stable Extremal Regions\
  \ (MSERs) which provides robustness to geometric and illumination conditions. \n\
  \ \nThe performance of the method is evaluated on two standard datasets. On the\
  \ Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art.\
  \ The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the\
  \ standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset. The text localization works\
  \ for number of alphabets and the method is easily adapted to recognition of other\
  \ scripts, e.g. cyrillics."
