paperAbstract: In this paper we are interested in how semantic segmentation can help
  object detection. Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model
  which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object
  regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach
  allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores
  each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of
  novel segmentation features. Thus our model ``blends'' between the detector and
  segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the
  segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only
  a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector on all classes, achieving
  13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM
  in $19$ out of $20$ classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we
  outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC 2010 test by 4%.
