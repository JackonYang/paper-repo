paperAbstract: Discriminative methods have shown significant improvements over traditional
  generative methods in many machine learning applications, but there has been difficulty
  in extending them to natural language parsing. One problem is that much of the work
  on discriminative methods conflates changes to the learning method with changes
  to the parameterization of the problem. We show how a parser can be trained with
  a discriminative learning method while still parameterizing the problem according
  to a generative probability model. We present three methods for training a neural
  network to estimate the probabilities for a statistical parser, one generative,
  one discriminative, and one where the probability model is generative but the training
  criteria is discriminative. The latter model outperforms the previous two, achieving
  state-of-the-art levels of performance (90.1% F-measure on constituents).
