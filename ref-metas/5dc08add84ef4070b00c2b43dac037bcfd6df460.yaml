paperAbstract: Tables are a common structuring element in many documents, such as
  PDF files. To reuse such tables, appropriate methods need to be develop, which capture
  the structure and the content information. We have developed several heuristics
  which together recognize and decompose tables in PDF files and store the extracted
  data in a structured data format (XML) for easier reuse. Additionally, we implemented
  a prototype, which gives the user the ability of making adjustments on the extracted
  data. Our work shows that purely heuristic-based approaches can achieve good results,
  especially for lucid tables.
