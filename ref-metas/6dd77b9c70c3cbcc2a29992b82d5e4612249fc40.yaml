paperAbstract: Until the pioneering work of HUBEL and WIESEL (1, 2, 3), visual scientists
  could do little more than guess about the functions of cells in visual cortex and
  the manner in which complex patterns were analyzed. Their initial reports, however,
  established that cells in Area 17 of cat (and also monkey) were quite unresponsive
  to full-field illumination, requiring more specific patterns to elicit a response.
  Their receptive field (RF) maps of simple cells showed an elongated excitatory center
  and inhibitory flanks, or vice versa; or two adjacent excitatory and inhibitory
  areas. Initially HUBEL and WIESEL (2) reported that there was summation within the
  excitatory and inhibitory regions and an antagonism between them. As we shall see,
  such summation, if true, would have implications not at all foreseen at the time,
  and would lead one, in fact, to a quite different model of what such cells do from
  the one which they actually proposed.
