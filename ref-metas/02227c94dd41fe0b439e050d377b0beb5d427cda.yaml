paperAbstract: 'Detecting and reading text from natural images is a hard computer
  vision task that is central to a variety of emerging applications. Related problems
  like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision
  and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications
  like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex
  scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods
  lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the
  problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning
  methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce
  a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits
  cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing
  these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally,
  we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods
  and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks.'
