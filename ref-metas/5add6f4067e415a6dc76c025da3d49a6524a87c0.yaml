paperAbstract: The time required to recognize that two perspective drawings portray
  objects of the same three-dimensional shape is found to be (i) a linearly increasing
  function of the angular difference in the portrayed orientations of the two objects
  and (ii) no shorter for differences corresponding simply to a rigid rotation of
  one of the two-dimensional drawings in its own picture plane than for differences
  corresponding to a rotation of the three-dimensional object in depth.
