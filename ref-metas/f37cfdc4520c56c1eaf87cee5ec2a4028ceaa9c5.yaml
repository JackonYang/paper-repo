paperAbstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been the state-of-the-art techniques
  for acoustic modeling despite their unrealistic independence assumptions and the
  very limited representational capacity of their hidden states. There are many proposals
  in the research community for deeper models that are capable of modeling the many
  types of variability present in the speech generation p r cess. Deep Belief Networks
  (DBNs) have recently proved to be very effective fo r a variety of machine learning
  problems and this paper applies DBNs to acous ti modeling. On the standard TIMIT
  corpus, DBNs consistently outperform ot her techniques and the best DBN achieves
  a phone error rate (PER) of 23.0% on the T IMIT core test set.
