paperAbstract: Classifying heterogeneous visually rich documents is a challenging
  task. Difficulty of this task increases even more if the maximum allowed inference
  turnaround time is constrained by a threshold. The increased overhead in inference
  cost, compared to the limited gain in classification capabilities make current multi-scale
  approaches infeasible in such scenarios. There are two major contributions of this
  work. First, we propose a spatial pyramid model to extract highly discriminative
  multi-scale feature descriptors from a visually rich document by leveraging the
  inherent hierarchy of its layout. Second, we propose a deterministic routing scheme
  for accelerating end-to-end inference by utilizing the spatial pyramid model. A
  depth-wise separable multi-column convolutional network is developed to enable our
  method. We evaluated the proposed approach on four publicly available, benchmark
  datasets of visually rich documents. Results suggest that our proposed approach
  demonstrates robust performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in both
  classification accuracy and total inference turnaround.
