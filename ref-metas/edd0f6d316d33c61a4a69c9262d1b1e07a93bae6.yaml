paperAbstract: Recognizing text in natural images is a challenging task with many
  unsolved problems. Different from those in documents, words in natural images often
  possess irregular shapes, which are caused by perspective distortion, curved character
  placement, etc. We propose RARE (Robust text recognizer with Automatic REctification),
  a recognition model that is robust to irregular text. RARE is a speciallydesigned
  deep neural network, which consists of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a
  Sequence Recognition Network (SRN). In testing, an image is firstly rectified via
  a predicted Thin-Plate-Spline (TPS) transformation, into a more "readable" image
  for the following SRN, which recognizes text through a sequence recognition approach.
  We show that the model is able to recognize several types of irregular text, including
  perspective text and curved text. RARE is end-to-end trainable, requiring only images
  and associated text labels, making it convenient to train and deploy the model in
  practical systems. State-of-the-art or highly-competitive performance achieved on
  several benchmarks well demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.
