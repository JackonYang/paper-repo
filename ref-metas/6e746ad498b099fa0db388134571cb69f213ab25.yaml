paperAbstract: Automated searching through large sets of images to find a pattern
  'similar to this one' is considered. A key recognition method is evaluated on a
  library of almost 1000 images, based on the entire Brodatz texture album. The features
  used for searching rely on a significant improvement to the traditional Karhunen-Loeve
  (KL) transform which makes it shift-invariant. Results are shown for a variety of
  false alarm rates and for different subsets of KL features.<<ETX>>
