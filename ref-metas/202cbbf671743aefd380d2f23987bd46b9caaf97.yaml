paperAbstract: Motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the cortex, a
  number of algorithms have recently been proposed that try to learn hierarchical,
  or "deep," structure from unlabeled data. While several authors have formally or
  informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1
  (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms
  in terms of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical
  hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics
  certain properties of visual area V2. Specifically, we develop a sparse variant
  of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes
  in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to prior work on sparse
  coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge filters, similar to the Gabor
  functions known to model V1 cell receptive fields. Further, the second layer in
  our model encodes correlations of the first layer responses in the data. Specifically,
  it picks up both colinear ("contour") features as well as corners and junctions.
  More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex
  "corner" features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu's study of
  biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks
  holds promise for modeling more higher-order features.
