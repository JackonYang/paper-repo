paperAbstract: 'We describe a general methodology for the design of large-scale recursive
  neural network architectures (DAG-RNNs) which comprises three fundamental steps:
  (1) representation of a given domain using suitable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
  to connect visible and hidden node variables; (2) parameterization of the relationship
  between each variable and its parent variables by feedforward neural networks; and
  (3) application of weight-sharing within appropriate subsets of DAG connections
  to capture stationarity and control model complexity. Here we use these principles
  to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees,
  and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data
  structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models
  remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation
  of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale
  problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for
  protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fine- and
  coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models,
  and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed. The
  protein prediction servers are available over the Web at: www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm
