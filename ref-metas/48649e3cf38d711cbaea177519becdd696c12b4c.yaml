paperAbstract: This paper describes a text chunking system based on a generalization
  of the Winnow algorithm. We propose a general statistical model for text chunking
  which we then convert into a classification problem. We argue that the Winnow family
  of algorithms is particularly suitable for solving classification problems arising
  from NLP applications, due to their robustness to irrelevant features. However in
  theory, Winnow may not converge for linearly non-separable data. To remedy this
  problem, we employ a generalization of the original Winnow method. An additional
  advantage of the new algorithm is that it provides reliable confidence estimates
  for its classification predictions. This property is required in our statistical
  modeling approach. We show that our system achieves state of the art performance
  in text chunking with less computational cost then previous systems.
