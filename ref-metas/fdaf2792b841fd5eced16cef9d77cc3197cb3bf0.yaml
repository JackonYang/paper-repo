paperAbstract: "Despite impressive progress in people detection the performance on\
  \ challenging datasets like Caltech Pedestrians or TUD-Brussels is still unsatisfactory.\
  \ In this work we show that motion features derived from optic flow yield substantial\
  \ improvements on image sequences, if implemented correctly \u2014 even in the case\
  \ of low-quality video and consequently degraded flow fields. Furthermore, we introduce\
  \ a new feature, self-similarity on color channels, which consistently improves\
  \ detection performance both for static images and for video sequences, across different\
  \ datasets. In combination with HOG, these two features outperform the state-of-the-art\
  \ by up to 20%. Finally, we report two insights concerning detector evaluations,\
  \ which apply to classifier-based object detection in general. First, we show that\
  \ a commonly under-estimated detail of training, the number of bootstrapping rounds,\
  \ has a drastic influence on the relative (and absolute) performance of different\
  \ feature/classifier combinations. Second, we discuss important intricacies of detector\
  \ evaluation and show that current benchmarking protocols lack crucial details,\
  \ which can distort evaluations."
