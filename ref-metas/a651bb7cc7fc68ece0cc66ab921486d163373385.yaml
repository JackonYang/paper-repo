paperAbstract: The automatic removal of suffixes from words in English is of particular
  interest in the field of information retrieval. An algorithm for suffix stripping
  is described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program in BCPL. Although
  simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which
  it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds
  made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps.
  In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining
  stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length.
