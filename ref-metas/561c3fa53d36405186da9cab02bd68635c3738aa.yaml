paperAbstract: "Molecular \u201Cfingerprints\u201D encoding structural information\
  \ are the workhorse of cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications.\
  \ However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects\
  \ of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model\
  \ to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions, a machine\
  \ learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small\
  \ molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph\u2014\
  atoms, bonds, distances, etc.\u2014which allows the model to take greater advantage\
  \ of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform\
  \ all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent\
  \ a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for\
  \ future improvement."
