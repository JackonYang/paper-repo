paperAbstract: "Text retrieval systems typically produce a ranking of documents and\
  \ let a user decide how far down that ranking to go. In contrast, programs that\
  \ filter text streams, software that categorizes documents, agents which alert users,\
  \ and many other IR systems must make decisions without human input or supervision.\
  \ It is important to define what constitutes good effectiveness for these autonomous\
  \ systems, tune the systems to achieve the highest possible effectiveness, and estimate\
  \ how the effectiveness changes as new data is processed. We show how to do this\
  \ for binary text classification systems, emphasizing that different goals for the\
  \ system le ad to different optimal behaviors. Optimizing and estimating effectiveness\
  \ is greatly aided if classifiers that explicitly estimate the probability of class\
  \ membership are used. Ranked retrieval is the information retrieval (IR) researc\
  \ her\u2019s favorite tool for dealing with information overload. Ranked retrieval\
  \ systems display documents in order of probability of releva nce or some similar\
  \ measure. Users see the best documents first, anddecide how far down the ranking\
  \ to go in examining the available information. The central role played by ranking\
  \ in this appr oach has led researchers to evaluate IR systems primarily, often\
  \ exclusively, on the quality of their rankings. (See, for instance , the TREC evaluations\
  \ [1].) In some IR applications, however, ranking is not enough: A company provides\
  \ an SDI (selective dissemination of information) service which filters newswire\
  \ feeds. Relevant articles are faxed each morning to clients. Interaction between\
  \ customer and system takes place infrequently. The cost of resources (tying up\
  \ phone lines, fax machine paper, etc.) is a factor to consider in operating the\
  \ system. A text categorization system assigns controlled vocabulary categories\
  \ to incoming documents as they are stored in a text database. Cost cutting has\
  \ eliminated manual checking of category assignments."
