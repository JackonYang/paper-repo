paperAbstract: 'Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly
  capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the corruption
  noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is
  continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly
  learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However,
  it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders
  to the implicit estimation of the underlying data-generating distribution when the
  data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction
  errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the
  limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem,
  which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary
  reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued
  variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal
  contractive penalty).'
