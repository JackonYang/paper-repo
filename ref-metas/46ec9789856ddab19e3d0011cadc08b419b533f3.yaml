paperAbstract: 'For centuries, music has been shared and remembered by two traditions:
  aural transmission and in the form of written documents normally called musical
  scores. Many of these scores exist in the form of unpublished manuscripts and hence
  they are in danger of being lost through the normal ravages of time. To preserve
  the music some form of typesetting or, ideally, a computer system that can automatically
  decode the symbolic images and create new scores is required. Programs analogous
  to optical character recognition systems called optical music recognition (OMR)
  systems have been under intensive development for many years. However, the results
  to date are far from ideal. Each of the proposed methods emphasizes different properties
  and therefore makes it difficult to effectively evaluate its competitive advantages.
  This article provides an overview of the literature concerning the automatic analysis
  of images of printed and handwritten musical scores. For self-containment and for
  the benefit of the reader, an introduction to OMR processing systems precedes the
  literature overview. The following study presents a reference scheme for any researcher
  wanting to compare new OMR algorithms against well-known ones.'
