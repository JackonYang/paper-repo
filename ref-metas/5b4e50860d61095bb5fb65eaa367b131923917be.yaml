paperAbstract: "Recent years have seen greater interest in the use of discriminative\
  \ classifiers in tracking systems, owing to their success in object detection. They\
  \ are trained online with samples collected during tracking. Unfortunately, the\
  \ potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden, which directly\
  \ conflicts with real-time requirements. On the other hand, limiting the samples\
  \ may sacrifice performance. \n \nInterestingly, we observed that, as we add more\
  \ and more samples, the problem acquires circulant structure. Using the well-established\
  \ theory of Circulant matrices, we provide a link to Fourier analysis that opens\
  \ up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the Fast Fourier\
  \ Transform. This can be done in the dual space of kernel machines as fast as with\
  \ linear classifiers. We derive closed-form solutions for training and detection\
  \ with several types of kernels, including the popular Gaussian and polynomial kernels.\
  \ The resulting tracker achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art,\
  \ can be implemented with only a few lines of code and runs at hundreds of frames-per-second.\
  \ MATLAB code is provided in the paper (see Algorithm 1)."
