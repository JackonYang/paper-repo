paperAbstract: Sparse coding---that is, modelling data vectors as sparse linear combinations
  of basis elements---is widely used in machine learning, neuroscience, signal processing,
  and statistics. This paper focuses on learning the basis set, also called dictionary,
  to adapt it to specific data, an approach that has recently proven to be very effective
  for signal reconstruction and classification in the audio and image processing domains.
  This paper proposes a new online optimization algorithm for dictionary learning,
  based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large datasets
  with millions of training samples. A proof of convergence is presented, along with
  experiments with natural images demonstrating that it leads to faster performance
  and better dictionaries than classical batch algorithms for both small and large
  datasets.
