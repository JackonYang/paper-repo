paperAbstract: We analyze a few of the commonly used statistics based and machine
  learning algorithms for natural language disambiguation tasks and observe that they
  can be recast as learning linear separators in the feature space. Each of the methods
  makes a priori assumptions which it employs, given the data, when searching for
  its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as
  the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data
  driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature
  space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem.We present
  such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning
  algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems.
  The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate
  for domains having very large number of attributes.In particular, we present an
  extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several
  well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction,
  prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show
  that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs
  comparably to the best.
