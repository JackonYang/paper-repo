paperAbstract: In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained significant interest
  as a way of building hierarchical representations from unlabeled data. However,
  to our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied
  for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks to
  audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classification tasks.
  In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes.
  In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled audio data show
  very good performance for multiple audio classification tasks. We hope that this
  paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches applied to a wide range
  of audio recognition tasks.
