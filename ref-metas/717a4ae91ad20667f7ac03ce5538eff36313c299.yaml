paperAbstract: A method for extracting alternating horizontal and vertical projection
  profiles are from nested sub-blocks of scanned page images of technical documents
  is discussed. The thresholded profile strings are parsed using the compiler utilities
  Lex and Yacc. The significant document components are demarcated and identified
  by the recursive application of block grammars. Backtracking for error recovery
  and branch and bound for maximum-area labeling are implemented with Unix Shell programs.
  Results of the segmentation and labeling process are stored in a labeled x-y tree.
  It is shown that families of technical documents that share the same layout conventions
  can be readily analyzed. Results from experiments in which more than 20 types of
  document entities were identified in sample pages from two journals are presented.
