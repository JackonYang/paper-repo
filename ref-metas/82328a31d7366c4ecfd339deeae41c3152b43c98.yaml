paperAbstract: 'While numerous page segmentation algorithms have been proposed in
  the literature, there is lack of comparative evaluation of these algorithms. In
  the existing performance evaluation methods, two crucial components are usually
  missing: 1) automatic training of algorithms with free parameters and 2) statistical
  and error analysis of experimental results. We use the following five-step methodology
  to quantitatively compare the performance of page segmentation algorithms: 1) first,
  we create mutually exclusive training and test data sets with groundtruth, 2) we
  then select a meaningful and computable performance metric, 3) an optimization procedure
  is then used to search automatically for the optimal parameter values of the segmentation
  algorithms on the training data set, 4) the segmentation algorithms are then evaluated
  on the test data set, and, finally, 5) a statistical and error analysis is performed
  to give the statistical significance of the experimental results. In particular,
  instead of the ad hoc and manual approach typically used in the literature for training
  algorithms, we pose the automatic training of algorithms as an optimization problem
  and use the simplex algorithm to search for the optimal parameter value. A paired-model
  statistical analysis and an error analysis are then conducted to provide confidence
  intervals for the experimental results of the algorithms. This methodology is applied
  to the evaluation of live page segmentation algorithms of which, three are representative
  research algorithms and the other two are well-known commercial products, on 978
  images from the University of Washington III data set. It is found that the performance
  indices of the Voronoi, Docstrum, and Caere segmentation algorithms are not significantly
  different from each other, but they are significantly better than that of ScanSoft''s
  segmentation algorithm, which, in turn, is significantly better than that of X-Y
  cut.'
