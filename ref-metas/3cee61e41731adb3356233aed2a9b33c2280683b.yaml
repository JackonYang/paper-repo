paperAbstract: 'This book presents the most complete exposition of the theory of head-driven
  phrase structure grammar (HPSG), introduced in the authors'' "Information-Based
  Syntax and Semantics." HPSG provides an integration of key ideas from the various
  disciplines of cognitive science, drawing on results from diverse approaches to
  syntactic theory, situation semantics, data type theory, and knowledge representation.
  The result is a conception of grammar as a set of declarative and order-independent
  constraints, a conception well suited to modelling human language processing. This
  self-contained volume demonstrates the applicability of the HPSG approach to a wide
  range of empirical problems, including a number which have occupied center-stage
  within syntactic theory for well over twenty years: the control of "understood"
  subjects, long-distance dependencies conventionally treated in terms of "wh"-movement,
  and syntactic constraints on the relationship between various kinds of pronouns
  and their antecedents. The authors make clear how their approach compares with and
  improves upon approaches undertaken in other frameworks, including in particular
  the government-binding theory of Noam Chomsky.'
