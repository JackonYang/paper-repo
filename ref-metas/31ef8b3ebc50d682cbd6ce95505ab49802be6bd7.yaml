paperAbstract: "This paper describes a new program, correct, which takes words rejected\
  \ by the Unix\xAE spell program, proposes a list of candidate corrections, and sorts\
  \ them by probability. The probability scores are the novel contribution of this\
  \ work. Probabilities are based on a noisy channel model. It is assumed that the\
  \ typist knows what words he or she wants to type but some noise is added on the\
  \ way to the keyboard (in the form of typos and spelling errors). Using a classic\
  \ Bayesian argument of the kind that is popular in the speech recognition literature\
  \ (Jelinek, 1985), one can often recover the intended correction, c, from a typo,\
  \ t, by finding the correction c that maximizes Pr(c) Pr(t/c). The first factor,\
  \ Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the second factor, Pr(t/c), is\
  \ a model of the noisy channel that accounts for spelling transformations on letter\
  \ sequences (e.g., insertions, delections, substitutions and reversals). Both sets\
  \ of probabilities were trained on data collected from the Associated Press (AP)\
  \ newswire. This text is ideally suited for this purpose since it contains a large\
  \ number of typos (about two thousand per month)."
