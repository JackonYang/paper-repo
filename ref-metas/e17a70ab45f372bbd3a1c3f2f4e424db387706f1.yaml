paperAbstract: The article presents a method for the automatic extraction of the contents
  of passive and/or active cells in forms. The approach is based on the analysis and
  recognition of the types of intersection of the lines that make up such cells. Very
  little a priori knowledge of the form is required. The performance of this approach
  depends on the correction module mechanisms for detection and correction of errors
  generated during the intersection identification phase. The potentialities and advantages
  of this approach are described and illustrated with tests carried out on different
  form bases.
