paperAbstract: There is a substantial interest in retrieving images from a large database
  using the textual information contained in the images. An algorithm which will automatically
  locate the textual regions in the input image will facilitate this task; the optical
  character recognizer can then be applied to only those regions of the image which
  contain text. We present a method for automatically locating text in complex color
  images. The algorithm first finds the approximate locations of text lines using
  horizontal spatial variance, and then extracts text components in these boxes using
  color segmentation. The proposed method has been used to locate text in compact
  disc (CD) and book cover images, as well as in the images of traffic scenes captured
  by a video camera. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that these algorithms
  can be used in image retrieval applications.
