paperAbstract: In this paper we propose a novel method for learning a Mahalanobis
  distance measure to be used in the KNN classification algorithm. The algorithm directly
  maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set.
  It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be
  used for data visualization and fast classification. Unlike other methods, our classification
  model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions
  or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on
  several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction.
