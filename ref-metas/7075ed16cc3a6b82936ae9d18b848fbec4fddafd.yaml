paperAbstract: Kernel classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have recently
  achieved state-of-the art results on several popular datasets like Caltech or Pascal.
  This was possible by combining the advantages of SVM - convexity and the availability
  of efficient optimizers, with 'hyperkernels' - linear combinations of kernels computed
  at multiple levels of image encoding. The use of hyperkernels faces the challenge
  of choosing the kernel weights, the use of possibly irrelevant, poorly performing
  kernels, and an increased number of parameters that can lead to overfitting. In
  this paper we advocate the transition from SVMs to Support Kernel Machines (SKM)
  - models that estimate both the parameters of a sparse linear combination of kernels,
  and the parameters of a discriminative classifier. We exploit recent kernel learning
  techniques, not previously used in computer vision, that show how learning SKMs
  can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently
  using Sequential Minimal Optimization. We study kernel learning for several multi-level
  image encodings for supervised object recognition and report competitive results
  on several datasets, including INRIA pedestrian, Caltech 101 and the newly created
  Caltech 256.
