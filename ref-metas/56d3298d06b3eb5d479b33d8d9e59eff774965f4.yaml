paperAbstract: We describe an approach for table location in document images. The
  documents are described by means of a hierarchical representation that is based
  on the MXY tree. The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines
  in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating
  perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel
  lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity
  criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an
  appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds
  involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize
  tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training
  set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500
  pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs.
