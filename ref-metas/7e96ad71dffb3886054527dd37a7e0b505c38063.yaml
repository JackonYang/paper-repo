paperAbstract: We introduce a method to solve exactly a first order Markov random
  field optimization problem in more generality than was previously possible. The
  MRF has a prior term that is convex in terms of a linearly ordered label set. The
  method maps the problem into a minimum-cut problem for a directed graph, for which
  a globally optimal solution can be found in polynomial time. The convexity of the
  prior function in the energy is shown to be necessary and sufficient for the applicability
  of the method.
