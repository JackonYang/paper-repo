paperAbstract: Computational theories of structure-from-motion and stereo vision only
  specify the computation of three-dimensional surface information at special points
  in the image. Yet the visual perception is clearly of complete surfaces. To account
  for this a computational theory of the interpolation of surfaces from visual information
  is presented. The problem is constrained by the fact that the surface must agree
  with the information from stereo or motion correspondence, and not vary radically
  between these points. Using the image irradiance equation, an explicit form of this
  surface consistency constraint can be derived. To determine which of two possible
  surfaces is more consistent with the surface consistency constraint, one must be
  able to compare the two surfaces. To do this, a functional from the space of possible
  functions to the real numbers is required. In this way, the surface most consistent
  with the visual information will be that which minimizes the functional. To ensure
  that the functional has a unique minimal surface, conditions on the form of the
  functional are derived. In particular, if the functional is a complete semi-norm
  that satisfies the parallelogram law, or the space of functions is a semi-Hilbert
  space and the functional is a semi-inner product, then there is a unique (to within
  possibly an element of the null space of the functional) surface that is most consistent
  with the visual information. It can be shown, based on the above conditions plus
  a condition of rotational symmetry, that there is a vector space of possible functionals
  that measure surface consistency, this vector space being spanned by the functional
  of quadratic variation and the functional of square Laplacian. Arguments based on
  the null spaces of the respective functionals are used to justify the choice of
  the quadratic variation as the optimal functional. Possible refinements to the theory,
  concerning the role of discontinuities in depth and the effects of applying the
  interpolation process to scenes containing more than one object, are discussed.
