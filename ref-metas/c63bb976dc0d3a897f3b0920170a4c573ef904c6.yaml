paperAbstract: Following the recent adoption by the machine translation community
  of automatic evaluation using the BLEU/NIST scoring process, we conduct an in-depth
  study of a similar idea for evaluating summaries. The results show that automatic
  evaluation using unigram co-occurrences between summary pairs correlates surprising
  well with human evaluations, based on various statistical metrics; while direct
  application of the BLEU evaluation procedure does not always give good results.
