paperAbstract: Abstract There is growing interest in using automatically computed
  corpus-based evaluation metrics to evaluate Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems,
  because these are often considerably cheaper than the human-based evaluations which
  have traditionally been used in NLG. We review previous work on NLG evaluation and
  on validation of automatic metrics in NLP, and then present the results of two studies
  of how well some metrics which are popular in other areas of NLP (notably BLEU and
  ROUGE) correlate with human judgments in the domain of computer-generated weather
  forecasts. Our results suggest that, at least in this domain, metrics may provide
  a useful measure of language quality, although the evidence for this is not as strong
  as we would ideally like to see; however, they do not provide a useful measure of
  content quality. We also discuss a number of caveats which must be kept in mind
  when interpreting this and other validation studies.
