paperAbstract: 'We propose a system that reads the text encountered in natural scenes
  with the aim to provide assistance to the visually impaired persons. This paper
  describes the system design and evaluates several character extraction methods.
  Automatic text recognition from natural images receives a growing attention because
  of potential applications in image retrieval, robotics and intelligent transport
  system. Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing
  resolution and availability of digital cameras. However, in the case of a blind
  person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed,
  because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. At
  first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it
  zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character
  recognition. In the present paper, we propose four character-extraction methods
  based on connected components. We tested the effectiveness of our methods on the
  ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data. The performance of the different methods
  depends on character size. In the data, bigger characters are more prevalent and
  the most effective extraction method proves to be the sequence: Sobel edge detection,
  Otsu binarization, connected component extraction and rule-based connected component
  filtering.'
