paperAbstract: Abstract The notion of a recursive causal graph is introduced, hopefully
  capturing the essential aspects of the path diagrams usually associated with recursive
  causal models. We describe the conditional independence constraints which such graphs
  are meant to embody and prove a theorem relating the fulfilment of these constraints
  by a probability distribution to a particular sort of factorisation. The relation
  of our results to the usual linear structural equations on the one hand, and to
  log-linear models, on the other, is also explained
