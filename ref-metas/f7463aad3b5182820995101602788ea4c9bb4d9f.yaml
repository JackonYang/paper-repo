paperAbstract: We consider the use of language models whose size and accuracy are
  intermediate between different order n-gram models. Two types of models are studied
  in particular. Aggregate Markov models are classbased bigram models in which the
  mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine
  bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of
  models are trained by ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithms for maximum likelihood
  estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed
  between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity
  of unseen word combinations.
