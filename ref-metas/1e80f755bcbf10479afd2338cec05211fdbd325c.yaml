paperAbstract: There has been much interest in unsupervised learning of hierarchical
  generative models such as deep belief networks. Scaling such models to full-sized,
  high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we
  present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which
  scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports
  efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is
  probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of
  higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm
  learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images
  of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual
  recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and
  top-down) inference over full-sized images.
