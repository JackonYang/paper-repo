paperAbstract: 'xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different
  areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations
  which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and
  more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general
  discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to
  informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and
  other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper
  I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information
  theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider
  perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much
  of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events
  are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the
  states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing),
  we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent
  states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent
  states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The

  is precisely equivalent to an assertion that the world as we know it is lawful.
  In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types
  of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly
  relevant to processes of visual perception.'
