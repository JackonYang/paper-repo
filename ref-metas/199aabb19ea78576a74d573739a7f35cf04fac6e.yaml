paperAbstract: This paper presents an algorithm for recovering the globally optimal
  2D human figure detection using a loopy graph model. This is computationally challenging
  because the time complexity scales exponentially in the size of the largest clique
  in the graph. The proposed algorithm uses Branch and Bound (BB) to search for the
  globally optimal solution. The algorithm converges rapidly in practice and this
  is due to a novel method for quickly computing tree based lower bounds. The key
  idea is to recycle the dynamic programming (DP) tables associated with the tree
  model to look up the tree based lower bound rather than recomputing the lower bound
  from scratch. This technique is further sped up using Range Minimum Query data structures
  to provide O(1) cost for computing the lower bound for most iterations of the BB
  algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on the Iterative Parsing dataset and it is
  shown to run fast empirically.
