paperAbstract: "THE visual recognition of three-dimensional (3-D) objects on the basis\
  \ of their shape poses at least two difficult problems. First, there is the problem\
  \ of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable\
  \ features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second,\
  \ there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the\
  \ viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the\
  \ viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed\
  \ and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally\
  \ employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself\
  \ a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have\
  \ developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions,\
  \ that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint\
  \ to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize'\
  \ the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."
