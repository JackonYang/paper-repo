paperAbstract: 'Vision tasks, such as segmentation, grouping, recognition, can be
  formulated as graph partition problems. The recent literature witnessed two popular
  graph cut algorithms: the Ncut using spectral graph analysis and the minimum-cut
  using the maximum flow algorithm. We present a third major approach by generalizing
  the Swendsen-Wang method - a well celebrated algorithm in statistical mechanics.
  Our algorithm simulates ergodic, reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph
  partitions to sample a posterior probability. At each step, the algorithm splits,
  merges, or regroups a sizable subgraph, and achieves fast mixing at low temperature
  enabling a fast annealing procedure. Experiments show it converges in 2-30 seconds
  on a PC for image segmentation. This is 400 times faster than the single-site update
  Gibbs sampler, and 20-40 times faster than the DDMCMC algorithm. The algorithm can
  optimize over the number of models and works for general forms of posterior probabilities,
  so it is more general than the existing graph cut approaches.'
