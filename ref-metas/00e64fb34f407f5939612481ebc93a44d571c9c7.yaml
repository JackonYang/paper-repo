paperAbstract: "One of the more powerful impressions created by vision is that of\
  \ a coherent, richly detailed world where everything is present simultaneously.\
  \ Indeed, this impression is so compelling that we tend to ascribe these properties\
  \ not only to the external world, but to our internal representations as well. But\
  \ results from several recent experiments argue against this latter ascription.\
  \ For example, changes in images of real-world scenes often go unnoticed when made\
  \ during a saccade, flicker, blink, or movie cut. This \u201Cchange blindness\u201D\
  \ provides strong evidence against the idea that our brains contain a picture-like\
  \ representation of the scene that is everywhere detailed and coherent.\r\nHow then\
  \ do we represent a scene? It is argued here that focused attention provides spatiotemporal\
  \ coherence for the stable representation of one object at a time. It is then argued\
  \ that the allocation of attention can be co-ordinated to create a \u201Cvirtual\
  \ representation\u201D. In such a scheme, a stable object representation is formed\
  \ whenever needed, making it appear to higher levels as if all objects in the scene\
  \ are represented in detail simultaneously."
