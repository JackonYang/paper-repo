paperAbstract: A new method is presented for analyzing document images and constructing
  a database from them. This method is implemented in an electronic library system
  named CyberMagazine, where document images are sequentially converted into database
  tuples by block segmentation, rough classification, and syntactic analysis. CyberMagazine's
  image understanding method combines the use of decision tree classification and
  syntactic analysis using a newly presented matrix grammar. In order to combine the
  classification and the syntactic analysis steps, the authors propose an augmentation
  technique for carrying out decision tree classification. Experimental results subsequently
  demonstrate that high understanding accuracy is obtained by adequate augmentation.
