paperAbstract: An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert
  an input vector into a code vector. It then uses a set of generative weights to
  convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector.
  We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description
  Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe
  both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information
  is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution,
  where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given
  the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations,
  it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it
  involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder
  can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this
  approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound
  is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative
  and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn
  factorial codes.
