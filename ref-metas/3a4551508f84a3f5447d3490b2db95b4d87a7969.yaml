paperAbstract: "The approach of learning of multiple \u201Crelated\u201D tasks simultaneously\
  \ has proven quite successful in practice; however, theoretical justification for\
  \ this success has remained elusive. The starting point for previous work on multiple\
  \ task learning has been that the tasks to be learned jointly are somehow \u201C\
  algorithmically related\u201D, in the sense that the results of applying a specific\
  \ learning algorithm to these tasks are assumed to be similar. We offer an alternative\
  \ approach, defining relatedness of tasks on the basis of similarity between the\
  \ example generating distributions that underline these task."
