paperAbstract: A comprehensive look at learning and generalization theory. The statistical
  theory of learning and generalization concerns the problem of choosing desired functions
  on the basis of empirical data. Highly applicable to a variety of computer science
  and robotics fields, this book offers lucid coverage of the theory as a whole. Presenting
  a method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency
  of learning process, the author covers function estimates from small data pools,
  applying these estimations to real-life problems, and much more.
