paperAbstract: We present a perceptron-style discriminative approach to machine translation
  in which large feature sets can be exploited. Unlike discriminative reranking approaches,
  our system can take advantage of learned features in all stages of decoding. We
  first discuss several challenges to error-driven discriminative approaches. In particular,
  we explore different ways of updating parameters given a training example. We find
  that making frequent but smaller updates is preferable to making fewer but larger
  updates. Then, we discuss an array of features and show both how they quantitatively
  increase BLEU score and how they qualitatively interact on specific examples. One
  particular feature we investigate is a novel way to introduce learning into the
  initial phrase extraction process, which has previously been entirely heuristic.
