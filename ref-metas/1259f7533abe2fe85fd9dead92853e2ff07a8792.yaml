paperAbstract: 'We present a robust end-to-end neural-based model to attentively recognize
  text in natural images. Particularly, we focus on accurately identifying irregular
  (perspectively distorted or curved) text, which has not been well addressed in the
  previous literature. Previous research on text reading often works with regular
  (horizontal and frontal) text and does not adequately generalize to processing text
  with perspective distortion or curving effects. Our work proposes to overcome this
  difficulty by introducing two learning components: (1) an auxiliary dense character
  detection task that helps to learn text specific visual patterns, (2) an alignment
  loss that provides guidance to the training of an attention model. We show with
  experiments that these two components are crucial for achieving fast convergence
  and high classification accuracy for irregular text recognition. Our model outperforms
  previous work on two irregular-text datasets: SVT-Perspective and CUTE80, and is
  also highly-competitive on several regular-text datasets containing primarily horizontal
  and frontal text.'
