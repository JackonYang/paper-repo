paperAbstract: One of the fundamental challenges in pattern recognition is choosing
  a set of features appropriate to a class of problems. In applications such as database
  retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide
  good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a
  new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model
  is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting
  mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described
  as "periodicity," "directionality," and "randomness," approximating what are indicated
  to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method
  presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety
  of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under
  image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the
  new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated
  for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness
  of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated
  in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold
  model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity
  while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition
  criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented.
