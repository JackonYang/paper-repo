paperAbstract: Scene classification is a major open challenge in machine vision. Most
  solutions proposed so far such as those based on color histograms and local texture
  statistics cannot capture a scene's global configuration, which is critical in perceptual
  judgments of scene similarity. We present a novel approach, "configural recognition",
  for encoding scene class structure. The approach's main feature is its use of qualitative
  spatial and photometric relationships within and across regions in low resolution
  images. The emphasis on qualitative measures leads to enhanced generalization abilities
  and the use of low-resolution images renders the scheme computationally efficient.
  We present results on a large database of natural scenes. We also describe how qualitative
  scene concepts may be learned from examples.
