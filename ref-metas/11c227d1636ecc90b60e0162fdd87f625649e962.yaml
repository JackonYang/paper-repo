paperAbstract: A ranging system, consisting of a laser, computer-controlled optical
  deflection assembly, and TV camera, obtains three-dimensional images of curved solid
  objects. The object is segmented into parts by grouping parallel traces obtained
  from the ranging system. Making use of the property of generalized translational
  invariance, the parts are described in terms of generalized cylinders, consisting
  of a space curve, or axis, and a circular cross section function on this axis.
