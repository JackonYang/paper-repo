paperAbstract: Embedded captions in TV programs such as news broadcasts, documentaries
  and coverage of sports events provide important information on the underlying events.
  In digital video libraries, such captions represent a highly condensed form of key
  information on the contents of the video. In this paper we propose a scheme to automatically
  detect the presence of captions embedded in video frames. The proposed method operates
  on reduced image sequences which are efficiently reconstructed from compressed MPEG
  video and thus does not require full frame decompression. The detection, extraction
  and analysis of embedded captions help to capture the highlights of visual contents
  in video documents for better organization of video, to present succinctly the important
  messages embedded in the images, and to facilitate browsing, searching and retrieval
  of relevant clips.
