paperAbstract: Combining deep neural networks with structured logic rules is desirable
  to harness flexibility and reduce uninterpretability of the neural models. We propose
  a general framework capable of enhancing various types of neural networks (e.g.,
  CNNs and RNNs) with declarative first-order logic rules. Specifically, we develop
  an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of logic
  rules into the weights of neural networks. We deploy the framework on a CNN for
  sentiment analysis, and an RNN for named entity recognition. With a few highly intuitive
  rules, we obtain substantial improvements and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable
  results to previous best-performing systems.
