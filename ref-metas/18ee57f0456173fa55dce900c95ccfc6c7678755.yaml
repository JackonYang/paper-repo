paperAbstract: "Abstract. A labelling approach for the automatic recognition of tables\
  \ of contents (ToC) is described in this paper. A prototype is used for the electronic\
  \ consulting of scientific papers in a digital library system named Calliope. This\
  \ method operates on a roughly structured ASCII file, produced by OCR. The recognition\
  \ approach operates by text labelling without using any a priori model. Labelling\
  \ is based on part-of-speech tagging (PoS) which is initiated by a primary labelling\
  \ of text components using some specific dictionaries. Significant tags are first\
  \ grouped into homogeneous classes according to their grammar categories and then\
  \ reduced in canonical forms corresponding to article fields: \u201Ctitle\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cauthors\u201D. Non-labelled tokens are integrated in one or another\
  \ field by either applying PoS correction rules or using a structure model generated\
  \ from well-detected articles. The designed prototype operates very well on different\
  \ ToC layouts and character recognition qualities. Without manual intervention,\
  \ a 96.3% rate of correct segmentation was obtained on 38 journals, including 2,020\
  \ articles, accompanied by a 93.0% rate of correct field extraction."
