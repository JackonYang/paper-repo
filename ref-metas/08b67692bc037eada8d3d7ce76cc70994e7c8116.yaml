paperAbstract: Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form
  of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied
  to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A
  principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the
  empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond
  to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of
  thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation
  equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation.
