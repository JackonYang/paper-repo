paperAbstract: 'Abstract : The visual analysis of surface shape from texture and surface
  contour is treated within a computational framework. The aim of this study is to
  determine valid constraints that are sufficient to allow surface orientation and
  distance (up to a multiplicative constant) to be computed from the image of surface
  texture and of surface contours. The report is in three parts. Part I consists of
  a review of major theories of surface perception, a discussion of vision as computation
  and of the nature in which three-dimensional information is manifest in the image,
  and a study of the representation of local surface orientation. Part II reconisiders
  the familiar ''texture gradient''. Part III examines our preception of surface contours.
  It is shown that surface contours are strong sources of information about local
  surface shape.'
