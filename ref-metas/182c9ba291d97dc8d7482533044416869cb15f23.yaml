paperAbstract: "This paper addresses the problem of acoustic phonetic modeling. First,\
  \ heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic\
  \ information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier\
  \ systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement\
  \ spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized\
  \ as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents\
  \ committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and\
  \ context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the\
  \ system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates\
  \ are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments\
  \ with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error\
  \ rate reductions of 10\u201316%."
