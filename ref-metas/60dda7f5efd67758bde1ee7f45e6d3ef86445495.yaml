paperAbstract: "Recursive neural networks comprise a class of architecture that can\
  \ operate on structured input. They have been previously successfully applied to\
  \ model com-positionality in natural language using parse-tree-based structural\
  \ representations. Even though these architectures are deep in structure, they lack\
  \ the capacity for hierarchical representation that exists in conventional deep\
  \ feed-forward networks as well as in recently investigated deep recurrent neural\
  \ networks. In this work we introduce a new architecture \u2014 a deep recursive\
  \ neural network (deep RNN) \u2014 constructed by stacking multiple recursive layers.\
  \ We evaluate the proposed model on the task of fine-grained sentiment classification.\
  \ Our results show that deep RNNs outperform associated shallow counterparts that\
  \ employ the same number of parameters. Furthermore, our approach outperforms previous\
  \ baselines on the sentiment analysis task, including a multiplicative RNN variant\
  \ as well as the recently introduced paragraph vectors, achieving new state-of-the-art\
  \ results. We provide exploratory analyses of the effect of multiple layers and\
  \ show that they capture different aspects of compositionality in language."
