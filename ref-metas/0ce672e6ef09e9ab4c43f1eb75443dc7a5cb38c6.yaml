paperAbstract: 'Psychophysical and physiological evidence indicates that the visual
  system of primates and humans has evolved a specialized processing focus moving
  across the visual scene. This study addresses the question of how simple networks
  of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this
  shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1)
  A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement,
  disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called
  the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic
  representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at
  any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single
  location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping
  is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of
  selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent
  whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into
  the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in
  the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network.
  Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards
  the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity
  preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks
  and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex
  to the LGN.'
