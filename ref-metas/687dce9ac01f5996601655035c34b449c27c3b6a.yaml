paperAbstract: We present a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing, WASP,
  for constructing a complete, formal meaning representation of a sentence. A semantic
  parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning
  representations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical
  machine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition,
  and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We
  show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared
  to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows
  better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order.
