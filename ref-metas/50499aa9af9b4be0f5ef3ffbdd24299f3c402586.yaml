paperAbstract: "Psychologists have proposed that many human-object interaction activities\
  \ form unique classes of scenes. Recognizing these scenes is important for many\
  \ social functions. To enable a computer to do this is however a challenging task.\
  \ Take people-playing-musical-instrument (PPMI) as an example; to distinguish a\
  \ person playing violin from a person just holding a violin requires subtle distinction\
  \ of characteristic image features and feature arrangements that differentiate these\
  \ two scenes. Most of the existing image representation methods are either too coarse\
  \ (e.g. BoW) or too sparse (e.g. constellation models) for performing this task.\
  \ In this paper, we propose a new image feature representation called \u201Cgrouplet\u201D\
  . The grouplet captures the structured information of an image by encoding a number\
  \ of discriminative visual features and their spatial configurations. Using a dataset\
  \ of 7 different PPMI activities, we show that grouplets are more effective in classifying\
  \ and detecting human-object interactions than other state-of-the-art methods. In\
  \ particular, our method can make a robust distinction between humans playing the\
  \ instruments and humans co-occurring with the instruments without playing."
