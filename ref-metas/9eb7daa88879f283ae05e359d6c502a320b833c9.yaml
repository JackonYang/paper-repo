paperAbstract: In this paper we present IAM-OnDB - a new large online handwritten
  sentences database. It is publicly available and consists of text acquired via an
  electronic interface from a whiteboard. The database contains about 86 K word instances
  from an 11 K dictionary written by more than 200 writers. We also describe a recognizer
  for unconstrained English text that was trained and tested using this database.
  This recognizer is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). In our experiments we show
  that by using larger training sets we can significantly increase the word recognition
  rate. This recognizer may serve as a benchmark reference for future research.
