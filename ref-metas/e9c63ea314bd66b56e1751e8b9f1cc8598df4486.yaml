paperAbstract: 'Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual
  cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the
  incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most
  cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and,
  second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The
  rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IV
  c, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with
  circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the
  right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IV c, most
  cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular
  cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two
  retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than
  the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These
  two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that
  cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized
  systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially
  to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these
  columns have the'
