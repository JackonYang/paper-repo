paperAbstract: Subjectivity is a pragmatic, sentence-level feature that has important
  implications for text processing applications such as information extraction and
  information retrieval. We study the effects of dynamic adjectives, semantically
  oriented adjectives, and gradable adjectives on a simple subjectivity classifier,
  and establish that they are strong predictors of subjectivity. A novel trainable
  method that statistically combines two indicators of gradability is presented and
  evaluated, complementing existing automatic techniques for assigning orientation
  labels.
