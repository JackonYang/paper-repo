paperAbstract: 'From the publisher: This is the first comprehensive introduction to
  Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a new generation learning system based on recent
  advances in statistical learning theory. SVMs deliver state-of-the-art performance
  in real-world applications such as text categorisation, hand-written character recognition,
  image classification, biosequences analysis, etc., and are now established as one
  of the standard tools for machine learning and data mining. Students will find the
  book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly
  through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications.
  The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while
  the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web
  sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further
  study. Equally, the book and its associated web site will guide practitioners to
  updated literature, new applications, and on-line software.'
