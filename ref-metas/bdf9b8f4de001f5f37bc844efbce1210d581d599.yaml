paperAbstract: "The human visual process can be studied by examining the computational\
  \ problems associated with deriving useful information from retinal images. In this\
  \ paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional\
  \ shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope\
  \ and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness\
  \ of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019\
  s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its\
  \ primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation,\
  \ and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its\
  \ descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a\
  \ shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate\
  \ system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular\
  \ organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example\
  \ the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4.\
  \ The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must\
  \ involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image\
  \ and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications\
  \ in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection\
  \ of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that\
  \ allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored\
  \ description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed\
  \ conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the\
  \ information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative\
  \ recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A\
  \ relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."
