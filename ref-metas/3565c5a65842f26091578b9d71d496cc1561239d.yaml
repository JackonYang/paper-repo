paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe a statistical method for 3D object detection.
  We represent the statistics of both object appearance and "non-object" appearance
  using a product of histograms. Each histogram represents the joint statistics of
  a subset of wavelet coefficients and their position on the object. Our approach
  is to use many such histograms representing a wide variety of visual attributes.
  Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect
  human faces with out-of-plane rotation and the first algorithm that can reliably
  detect passenger cars over a wide range of viewpoints.
