paperAbstract: 'Associative memories are conventionally used to represent data with
  very simple structure: sets of pairs of vectors. This paper describes a method for
  representing more complex compositional structure in distributed representations.
  The method uses circular convolution to associate items, which are represented by
  vectors. Arbitrary variable bindings, short sequences of various lengths, simple
  frame-like structures, and reduced representations can be represented in a fixed
  width vector. These representations are items in their own right and can be used
  in constructing compositional structures. The noisy reconstructions extracted from
  convolution memories can be cleaned up by using a separate associative memory that
  has good reconstructive properties.'
