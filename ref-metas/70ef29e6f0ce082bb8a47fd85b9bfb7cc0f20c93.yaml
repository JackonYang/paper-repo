paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems\
  \ is a complete andaccessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational\
  \ methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides\
  \ a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial\
  \ belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty,\
  \ such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic\
  \ logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\x97\
  and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making\
  \ semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques\
  \ serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory\
  \ with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs,\
  \ conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application\
  \ areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion,\
  \ decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\x97in\
  \ short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues\
  \ and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will\
  \ be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics,\
  \ logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals\
  \ in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and\
  \ statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical\
  \ use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses\
  \ in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
