paperAbstract: We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in
  the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and
  applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification,
  regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a
  model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks
  using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of
  the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with
  a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization
  performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.
  We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot
  image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and
  accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network
  policies.
