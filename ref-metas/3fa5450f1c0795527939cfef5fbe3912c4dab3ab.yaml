paperAbstract: Robust recognition of arbitrary object classes in natural visual scenes
  is an aspiring goal with numerous practical applications, for instance, in the area
  of autonomous robotics and autonomous vehicles. One obstacle on the way towards
  human-like recognition performance is the limitation of computational power, restricting
  the size of the training and testing dataset as well as the complexity of the object
  recognition system. In this work, we present a hierarchical, locally-connected neural
  network model that is well-suited for large-scale, high-performance object recognition.
  By using the NVIDIA CUDA framework, we create a massively parallel implementation
  of the model which is executed on a state-of-the-art graphics card. This implementation
  is up to 82 times faster than a single-core CPU version of the system. This significant
  gain in computational performance allows us to evaluate the model on a very large,
  realistic, and challenging set of natural images which we extracted from the LabelMe
  dataset. To compare our model to other approaches, we also evaluate the recognition
  performance using the well-known MNIST and NORB datasets, achieving a testing error
  rate of 0.76% and 2.87 %, respectively.
