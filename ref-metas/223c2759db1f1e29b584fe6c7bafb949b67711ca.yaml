paperAbstract: 'Abstract : A technique for recognizing systems of lines is presented,
  in which the heuristic of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm
  but is expressed in a figure of merit. A multistage decision process is then able
  to recognize in the input picture the optimal system of lines according to the given
  figure of merit. Due to the global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in
  the particular problem is achieved. The relation between the structure of the figure
  of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed. (Modified
