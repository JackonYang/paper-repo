paperAbstract: We use a close connection between the theory of Markov fields and that
  of log-linear interaction models for contingency tables to define and investigate
  a new class of models for such tables, graphical models. These models are hierarchical
  models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices
  as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given
  an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can
  be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical
  models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability
  of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give
  suggestions for further work.
