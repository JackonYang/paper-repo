paperAbstract: 'Abstract: This paper introduces a new architecture for human pose
  estimation using a multi- layer convolutional network architecture and a modified
  learning technique that learns low-level features and higher-level weak spatial
  models. Unconstrained human pose estimation is one of the hardest problems in computer
  vision, and our new architecture and learning schema shows significant improvement
  over the current state-of-the-art results. The main contribution of this paper is
  showing, for the first time, that a specific variation of deep learning is able
  to outperform all existing traditional architectures on this task. The paper also
  discusses several lessons learned while researching alternatives, most notably,
  that it is possible to learn strong low-level feature detectors on features that
  might even just cover a few pixels in the image. Higher-level spatial models improve
  somewhat the overall result, but to a much lesser extent then expected. Many researchers
  previously argued that the kinematic structure and top-down information is crucial
  for this domain, but with our purely bottom up, and weak spatial model, we could
  improve other more complicated architectures that currently produce the best results.
  This mirrors what many other researchers, like those in the speech recognition,
  object recognition, and other domains have experienced.'
