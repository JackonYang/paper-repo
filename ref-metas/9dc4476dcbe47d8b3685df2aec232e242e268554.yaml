paperAbstract: Image segmentation is difficult because objects may differ from their
  background by any of a variety of properties that can be observed in some, but often
  not all scales. A further complication is that coarse measurements, applied to the
  image for detecting these properties, often average over properties of neighboring
  segments, making it difficult to separate the segments and to reliably detect their
  boundaries. Below we present a method for segmentation that generates and combines
  multiscale measurements of intensity contrast, texture differences, and boundary
  integrity. The method is based on our former algorithm SWA, which efficiently detects
  segments that optimize a normalized-cut like measure by recursively coarsening a
  graph reflecting similarities between intensities of neighboring pixels. In this
  process aggregates of pixels of increasing size are gradually collected to form
  segments. We intervene in this process by computing properties of the aggregates
  and modifying the graph to reflect these coarse scale measurements. This allows
  us to detect regions that differ by fine as well as coarse properties, and to accurately
  locate their boundaries. Furthermore, by combining intensity differences with measures
  of boundary integrity across neighboring aggregates we can detect regions separated
  by weak, yet consistent edges.
