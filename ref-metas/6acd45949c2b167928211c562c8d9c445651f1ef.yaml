paperAbstract: We review recent developments in applying Bayesian probabilistic and
  statistical ideas to expert systems. Using a real, moderately complex, medical example
  we illustrate how qualitative and quantitative knowledge can be represented within
  a directed graphical model, generally known as a belief network in this context.
  Exact probabilistic inference on individual cases is possible using a general propagation
  procedure. When data on a series of cases are available, Bayesian statistical techniques
  can be used for updating the original subjective quantitative inputs, and we present
  a sets of diagnostics for identifying conflicts between the data and the prior specification.
  A model comparison procedure is explored, and a number of links made with mainstream
  statistical methods. Details are given on the use of Dirichlet prior distributions
  for learning about parameters and the process of transforming the original graphical
  model to a junction tree as the basis for efficient computation.
