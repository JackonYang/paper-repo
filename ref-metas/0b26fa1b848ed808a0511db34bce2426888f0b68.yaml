paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Language modeling is the attempt to characterize, capture
  and exploit regularities in natural language. In statistical language modeling,
  large amounts of text are used to automatically determine the model''s parameters.
  Language modeling is useful in automatic speech recognition, machine translation,
  and any other application that processes natural language with incomplete knowledge.
  In this thesis, I view language as an information source which emits a stream of
  symbols from a finite alphabet (the vocabulary). The goal of language modeling is
  then to identify and exploit sources of information in the language stream, so as
  to minimize its perceived entropy. Most existing statistical language models exploit
  the immediate past only. To extract information from further back in the document''s
  history, I use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. This allows
  the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical
  evidence from many sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation
  and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient.
  Instead, I apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source
  gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The
  intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are
  consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy
  within that set is the NE solution. Language modeling, Adaptive language modeling,
