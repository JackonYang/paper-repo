paperAbstract: Abstract The real-time recurrent learning algorithm is a gradient-following
  learning algorithm for completely recurrent networks running in continually sampled
  time. Here we use a series of simulation experiments to investigate the power and
  properties of this algorithm. In the recurrent networks studied here, any unit can
  be connected to any other, and any unit can receive external input. These networks
  run continually in the sense that they sample their inputs on every update cycle,
  and any unit can have a training target on any cycle. The storage required and computation
  time on each step are independent of time and are completely determined by the size
  of the network, so no prior knowledge of the temporal structure of the task being
  learned is required. The algorithm is nonlocal in the sense that each unit must
  have knowledge of the complete recurrent weight matrix and error vector. The algorithm
  is computationally intensive in sequential computers, requiring a storage capacity
  of the order of the thi...
