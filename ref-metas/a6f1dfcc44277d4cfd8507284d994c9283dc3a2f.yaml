paperAbstract: We have developed a near-real-time computer system that can locate
  and track a subject's head, and then recognize the person by comparing characteristics
  of the face to those of known individuals. The computational approach taken in this
  system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the
  practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach
  treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition
  problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage
  of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small
  set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images
  onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images.
  The significant features are known as "eigenfaces," because they are the eigenvectors
  (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to
  features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an
  individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize
  a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known
  individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for
  the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and
  that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.
