paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe an image collection created for the CLEF
  cross-language image retrieval track (ImageCLEF). This image retrieval benchmark
  (referred to as the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark) has developed from an initiative started
  by the Technical Committee 12 (TC-12) of the International Association of Pattern
  Recognition (IAPR). The collection consists of 20,000 images from a private photographic
  image collection. The construction and composition of the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark is
  described, including its associated text captions which are expressed in multiple
  languages, making the collection well-suited for evaluating the effectiveness of
  both textbased and visual retrieval methods. We also discuss the current and expected
  uses of the collection, including its use to benchmark and compare different image
  retrieval systems in ImageCLEF 2006.
