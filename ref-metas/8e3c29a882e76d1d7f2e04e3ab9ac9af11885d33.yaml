paperAbstract: This paper presents an efficient algorithm for image segmentation and
  a framework for perceptual grouping. It makes an attempt to provide one way of combining
  bottom-up and top-down approaches. In image segmentation, it generalizes the Swendsen-Wang
  cut algorithm (SWC) by Barbu and Zhu (2003) to make both 2-way and m-way cuts, and
  includes topology change processes (graph repartitioning and boundary diffusion).
  The method directly works at a low temperature without using annealing. We show
  that it is much faster than the DDMCMC approach (Tu and Zhu, 2002) and more robust
  than the SWC method. The results are demonstrated on the Berkeley data set. In perceptual
  grouping, it integrates discriminative model learning/computing, a belief propagation
  algorithm (BP) by Yedidia et al. (2000), and SWC into a three-layer computing framework.
  These methods are realized as different levels of approximation to an "ideal" generative
  model. We demonstrate the algorithm on the problem of human body configuration.
