paperAbstract: 'Cascade-Correlation is a new architecture and supervised learning
  algorithm for artificial neural networks. Instead of just adjusting the weights
  in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a minimal network,
  then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer
  structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side
  weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network,
  available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors.
  The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages over existing algorithms:
  it learns very quickly, the network determines its own size and topology, it retains
  the structures it has built even if the training set changes, and it requires no
  back-propagation of error signals through the connections of the network.'
