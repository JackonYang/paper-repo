paperAbstract: 'Quantization, the process of approximating continuous-amplitude signals
  by digital (discrete-amplitude) signals, is an important aspect of data compression
  or coding, the field concerned with the reduction of the number of bits necessary
  to transmit or store analog data, subject to a distortion or fidelity criterion.
  The independent quantization of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar
  quantization, while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block
  or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts employed
  in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment of its benefits and costs
  when compared to scalar quantization. Vector quantization is presented as a process
  of redundancy removal that makes effective use of four interrelated properties of
  vector parameters: linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape
  of the probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself. In
  contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear dependency and
  pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means of simple examples and the
  theoretical limits of vector quantizer performance are reviewed, based on results
  from rate-distortion theory. Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation,
  and performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the methods presented
  are quite general and can be used for the coding of arbitrary signals, this paper
  focuses primarily on the coding of speech signals and parameters.'
