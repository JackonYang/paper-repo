paperAbstract: We present SimLex-999, a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional
  semantic models that improves on existing resources in several important ways. First,
  in contrast to gold standards such as WordSim-353 and MEN, it explicitly quantifies
  similarity rather than association or relatedness so that pairs of entities that
  are associated but not actually similar (Freud, psychology) have a low rating. We
  show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999 incentivizes the development
  of models with a different, and arguably wider, range of applications than those
  which reflect conceptual association. Second, SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete
  and abstract adjective, noun, and verb pairs, together with an independent rating
  of concreteness and (free) association strength for each pair. This diversity enables
  fine-grained analyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types,
  and consequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved. Further,
  unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which automatic approaches have reached
  or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-the-art models perform
  well below this ceiling on SimLex-999. There is therefore plenty of scope for SimLex-999
  to quantify future improvements to distributional semantic models, guiding the development
  of the next generation of representation-learning architectures.
