paperAbstract: 'Fig. 1. Absolute value of the crosstalk with respect to the number
  of samples (NS) used to estimate the cross cumulants. Each point is the average
  of 10 experiments. to estimate the cross-cumulants. Each point in Fig. 1 corresponds
  to the average over 10 experiments, in which the mixing matrix is randomly chosen:
  The matrix entries mC3 (i # j) are random numbers in the range [-1, +1]. With 500
  samples, a residual crosstalk of about-20 dB is obtained. In the case of nonstationary
  signals, cross-cumulant estimation must be done on few samples and has a larger
  variance. Consequently, it can lead to more inaccurate estimation of the mixing
  matrix. We still obtained an interesting performance: a residual crosstalk of about-15
  to-20 dB, with various signals (colored noise, speech) and statistics estimated
  over 500 samples. In this correspondence, we proved that the mixing matrix can be.
  estimated using fourth-ordercross-cumulants, for two mixtures of two non-Gaussian
  sources. Solutions are obtained by rooting a fourth-order polynomial equation. Using
  second-order cross-cumulants allows us to simplify the method; the solution is then
  obtained by rooting two second-order polynomial equations and gives the result if
  one source is Gaussian. The methods are then quite simple, but its roots are very
  sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated cumulants. In fact, this direct solution
  is less accurate than indirect methods, especially adaptive a l g o r i b s. Moreover,
  we restricted the study to the separation of two sources, and theoretical solutions
  for three sources or more seems not easily tractable. However, in the case of two
  mixtures of two sources, it may give a good starting point with a small computation
  cost for any adaptive algorithm. REFERENCES J.-F. Cardoso, " Blind identification
