paperAbstract: A method is proposed for partitioning input scenes into regions in
  which selected picture properties are regarded as uniform. In this procedure, usual
  statistical methods of inspecting average gray levels are not used, but the uniformity
  of complex picture properties such as shapes, sizes or arrangements of subpatterns
  in the pictures is examined by a structural analysis. The analyzing process is controlled
  by a supervisor which gives the order of changing the depth of interest in each
  picture property, and successive partitioning of the pictures is made toward an
  interpretable goal partition.
