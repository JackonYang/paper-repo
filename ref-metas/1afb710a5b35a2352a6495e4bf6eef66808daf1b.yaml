paperAbstract: Deep neural networks continue to advance the state-of-the-art of image
  recognition tasks with various methods. However, applications of these methods to
  multimodality remain limited. We present Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for
  the multimodal residual learning of visual question-answering, which extends the
  idea of the deep residual learning. Unlike the deep residual learning, MRN effectively
  learns the joint representation from vision and language information. The main idea
  is to use element-wise multiplication for the joint residual mappings exploiting
  the residual learning of the attentional models in recent studies. Various alternative
  models introduced by multimodality are explored based on our study. We achieve the
  state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice
  tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of
  the joint representations for each learning block using back-propagation algorithm,
  even though the visual features are collapsed without spatial information.
