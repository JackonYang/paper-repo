paperAbstract: This article introduces a class of discrete iterative algorithms that
  are provably convergent alternatives to belief propagation (BP) and generalized
  belief propagation (GBP). Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman,
  and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond
  to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms
  by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a
  procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing
  a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms
  on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP.
  Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly
  (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often
  not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results
  found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly
  better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge).
  Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see
  Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally,
  we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications.
