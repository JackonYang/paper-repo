paperAbstract: Support Vector Machines using ANOVA Decomposition Kernels (SVAD) [Vapng]
  are a way of imposing a structure on multi-dimensional kernels which are generated
  as the tensor product of one-dimensional kernels. This gives more accurate control
  over the capacity of the learning machine (VCdimension). SVAD uses ideas from ANOVA
  decomposition methods and extends them to generate kernels which directly implement
  these ideas. SVAD is used with spline kernels and results show that SVAD performs
  better than the respective non ANOVA decomposition kernel. The Boston housing data
  set from UCI has been tested on Bagging [Bre94] and Support Vector methods before
  [DBK97] and these results are compared to the SVAD method.
