paperAbstract: 'We give improved lower bounds for the size of small depth circuits
  computing several functions. In particular we prove almost optimal lower bounds
  for the size of parity circuits. Further we show that there are functions computable
  in polynomial size and depth k but requires exponential size when the depth is restricted
  to k 1. Our Main Lemma which is of independent interest states that by using a random
  restriction we can convert an AND of small ORs to an OR of small ANDs and conversely.
  Warning: Essentially this paper has been published in Advances for Computing and
  is hence subject to copyright restrictions. It is for personal use only.'
