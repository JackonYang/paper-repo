paperAbstract: A mobile observer samples sequences of narrow-field projections of
  configurations in ambient space. The so-called structure-from-motion problem is
  to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections.
  For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible
  from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able
  to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the
  case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for
  the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly
  occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate
  how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way
  that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and
  specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which
  only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and
  no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration
  (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one
  to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and
  shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration.
  Results of a numerical experiment are discussed.
