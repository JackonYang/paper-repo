paperAbstract: We propose a generative model that codes the geometry and appearance
  of generic visual object categories as a loose hierarchy of parts, with probabilistic
  spatial relations linking parts to subparts, soft assignment of subparts to parts,
  and scale invariant keypoint based local features at the lowest level of the hierarchy.
  The method is designed to efficiently handle categories containing hundreds of redundant
  local features, such as those returned by current key-point detectors. This robustness
  allows it to outperform constellation style models, despite their stronger spatial
  models. The model is initialized by robust bottom-up voting over location-scale
  pyramids, and optimized by expectation-maximization. Training is rapid, and objects
  do not need to be marked in the training images. Experiments on several popular
  datasets show the method's ability to capture complex natural object classes.
