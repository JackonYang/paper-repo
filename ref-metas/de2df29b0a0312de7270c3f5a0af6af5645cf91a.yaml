paperAbstract: We present and compare various methods for computing word alignments
  using statistical or heuristic models. We consider the five alignment models presented
  in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment
  model, smoothing techniques, and refinements. These statistical models are compared
  with two heuristic models based on the Dice coefficient. We present different methods
  for combining word alignments to perform a symmetrization of directed statistical
  alignment models. As evaluation criterion, we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi
  alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We evaluate the models
  on the German-English Verbmobil task and the French-English Hansards task. We perform
  a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system
  and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes. An important result is
  that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model
  yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models. In the Appendix,
  we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented.
