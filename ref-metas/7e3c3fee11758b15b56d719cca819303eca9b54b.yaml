paperAbstract: "We investigate texture classification from single images obtained\
  \ under unknown viewpoint and illumination. A statistical approach is developed\
  \ where textures are modelled by the joint probability distribution of filter responses.\
  \ This distribution is represented by the frequency histogram of filter response\
  \ cluster centres (textons). Recognition proceeds from single, uncalibrated images\
  \ and the novelty here is that rotationally invariant filters are used and the filter\
  \ response space is low dimensional.Classification performance is compared with\
  \ the filter banks and methods of Leung and Malik [IJCV, 2001], Schmid [CVPR, 2001]\
  \ and Cula and Dana [IJCV, 2004] and it is demonstrated that superior performance\
  \ is achieved here. Classification results are presented for all 61 materials in\
  \ the Columbia-Utrecht texture database.We also discuss the effects of various parameters\
  \ on our classification algorithm--such as the choice of filter bank and rotational\
  \ invariance, the size of the texton dictionary as well as the number of training\
  \ images used. Finally, we present a method of reliably measuring relative orientation\
  \ co-occurrence statistics in a rotationally invariant manner, and discuss whether\
  \ incorporating such information can enhance the classifier\u2019s performance."
