paperAbstract: of the number of bits required to write down the observed data, has
  been reformulated to extend the classical maximum likelihood principle. The principle
  permits estimation of the number of the parameters in statistical models in addition
  to their values and even of the way the parameters appear in the models; i.e., of
  the model structures. The principle rests on a new way to interpret and construct
  a universal prior distribution for the integers, which makes sense even when the
  parameter is an individual object. Truncated realvalued parameters are converted
  to integers by dividing them by their precision, and their prior is determined from
  the universal prior for the integers by optimizing the precision. 1. Introduction.
  In this paper we study estimation based upon the principle of minimizing the total
  number of binary digits required to rewrite the observed data, when each observation
  is given with some precision. Instead of attempting at an absolutely shortest description,
  which would be futile, we look for the optimum relative to a class of parametrically
  given distributions. This Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which we introduced
  in a less comprehensive form in [25], turns out to degenerate to the more familiar
  Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle in case the number of parameters in the models
  is fixed, so that the description length of the parameters themselves can be ignored.
  In another extreme case, where the parameters determine the data, it similarly degenerates
  to Jaynes's principle of maximum entropy, [14]. But the main power of the new criterion
  is that it permits estimates of the entire model, its parameters, their number,
  and even the way the parameters appear in the model; i.e., the model structure.
  Hence, there will be no need to supplement the estimated parameters with a separate
  hypothesis test to decide whether a model is adequately parameterized or, perhaps,
  over parameterized.
