paperAbstract: 1. Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles
  described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's
  hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters
  analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters.
  2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response
  profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm),
  and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically
  indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach
  was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit
  the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual
  errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity
  in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare
  the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements
  described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated,
  indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show
  that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical
  expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive
  fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian
  separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered
  subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral
  response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform
  distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides
  a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive
  fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously
  in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains.
