paperAbstract: Presents an algorithm for the detection of faces in images using shared-weight
  replicated neural networks. A neural net forms rough hypotheses about the position
  of faces. These hypotheses are then verified using a second neural network. The
  algorithm applies to images where the size of the faces is unknown a priori. The
  computational time which is necessary for the complete processing of an image is
  reasonable. With a classical workstation an image of size 512*512 is treated in
  50 seconds including smoothing and normalization of the image. This algorithm can
  be easily installed on a more specialized machine as the major part of the operation
  is based on convolutions with kernels of size 5*5 or 8*8. In this paper, the authors
  assume that the face are well oriented in the image. It is possible to eliminate
  this assumption by following an approach similar to the one used for the scale problem.
  A net is trained to be insensitive to the precise orientation of the face. This
  kind of segmentation algorithm can be applied to other problems where the objects
  to be detected cannot be characterized easily by its outline or by classical primitives
  in image processing.
