paperAbstract: Much recent research in human activity recognition has focused on the
  problem of recognizing simple repetitive (walking, running, waving) and punctual
  actions (sitting up, opening a door, hugging). However, many interesting human activities
  are characterized by a complex temporal composition of simple actions. Automatic
  recognition of such complex actions can benefit from a good understanding of the
  temporal structures. We present in this paper a framework for modeling motion by
  exploiting the temporal structure of the human activities. In our framework, we
  represent activities as temporal compositions of motion segments. We train a discriminative
  model that encodes a temporal decomposition of video sequences, and appearance models
  for each motion segment. In recognition, a query video is matched to the model according
  to the learned appearances and motion segment decomposition. Classification is made
  based on the quality of matching between the motion segment classifiers and the
  temporal segments in the query sequence. To validate our approach, we introduce
  a new dataset of complex Olympic Sports activities. We show that our algorithm performs
  better than other state of the art methods.
