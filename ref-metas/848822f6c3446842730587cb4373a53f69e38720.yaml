paperAbstract: 'Until recently, most known decoding procedures for error-correcting
  codes were based either on algebraically calculating the error pattern or on some
  sort of tree or trellis search. With the advent of turbo coding, a third decoding
  principle has finally had its breakthrough: iterative decoding. With respect to
  Viterbi decoding, a code is most naturally described by means of a trellis diagram.
  The main thesis of the present paper is that, with respect to iterative decoding,
  the natural way of describing a code is by means of a Tanner graph, which may be
  viewed as a generalized trellis. More precisely, it is the "time axis" of a trellis
  that is generalized to a Tanner graph.'
