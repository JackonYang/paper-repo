paperAbstract: AIR/X is a rule-based system for indexing with terms (descriptors)
  from a prescribed vocabulary. For this task, an indexing dictionary with rules for
  mapping terms from the text onto descriptors is required, which can be derived automatically
  from a set of manually indexed documents. Based on the Darmstadt Indexing Approach,
  the indexing task is divided into a description step and a decision step. First,
  terms (single words or phrases) are identiied in the document text. With term-descriptor
  rules from the dictionary, descriptor indications are formed. The set of all indications
  from a document leading to the same descriptor is called a relevance description.
  A probabilistic classiication procedure computes indexing weights for each relevance
  description. Since the whole system is rule-based, it can be adapted to diierent
  subject elds by appropriate modiications of the rule bases. A major application
  of AIR/X is the AIR/PHYS system developed for a large physics database. This application
  is described in more detail along with experimental results.
