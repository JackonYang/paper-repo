paperAbstract: Triangle is a robust implementation of two-dimensional constrained
  Delaunay triangulation and Ruppert's Delaunay refinement algorithm for quality mesh
  generation. Several implementation issues are discussed, including the choice of
  triangulation algorithms and data structures, the effect of several variants of
  the Delaunay refinement algorithm on mesh quality, and the use of adaptive exact
  arithmetic to ensure robustness with minimal sacrifice of speed. The problem of
  triangulating a planar straight line graph (PSLG) without introducing new small
  angles is shown to be impossible for some PSLGs, contradicting the claim that a
  variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm solves this problem.
