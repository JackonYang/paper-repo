paperAbstract: In this article, we tackle the problem of depth estimation from single
  monocular images. Compared with depth estimation using multiple images such as stereo
  depth perception, depth from monocular images is much more challenging. Prior work
  typically focuses on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information,
  most using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features
  from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) set new records for various vision
  applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the
  depth values, depth estimation can be naturally formulated as a continuous conditional
  random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, here we present a deep convolutional
  neural field model for estimating depths from single monocular images, aiming to
  jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose
  a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials
  of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We then further propose an equally
  effective model based on fully convolutional networks and a novel superpixel pooling
  method, which is about 10 times faster, to speedup the patch-wise convolutions in
  the deep model. With this more efficient model, we are able to design deeper networks
  to pursue better performance. Our proposed method can be used for depth estimation
  of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In
  our case, the integral of the partition function can be calculated in a closed form
  such that we can exactly solve the log-likelihood maximization. Moreover, solving
  the inference problem for predicting depths of a test image is highly efficient
  as closed-form solutions exist. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets
  demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation
  approaches.
