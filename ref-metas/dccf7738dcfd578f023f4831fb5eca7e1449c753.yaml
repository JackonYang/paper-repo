paperAbstract: Digital library access is driven by features but features are often
  context dependent and noisy and their relevance for a query is not always obvious
  This paper describes an approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent
  and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal
  similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides
  a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings
  can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection
  process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent
  com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation
  weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest
  and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage
  adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions
  good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive
  time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation
  and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models
  or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of
  images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also
  introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries
  is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems
  for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform
  with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training
  data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents
  the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications
  One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures
  for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction
  and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported
  in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity
  measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately
  these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the
  typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure
  be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model
  of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the
  above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database
  On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based
  on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat
  by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness
  contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine
  all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal
  context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer
  seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense
  Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content
  nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable
  queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task
  speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con
  tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a
  variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library
  some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms
  is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features
  but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops
  may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated
  ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable
  and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition
  tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population
  of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools
  is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful
  for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations
  are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use
  This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but
  the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and
  don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive
  to improve its generalization ability
