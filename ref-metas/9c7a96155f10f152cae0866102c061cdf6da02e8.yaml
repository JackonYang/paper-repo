paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant
  interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including
  large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point
  location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest
  point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based
  on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used
  to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale
  of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over
  scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest
  points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative
  algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges
  to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized
  by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each
  point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant
  to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing
  ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations.
  Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in
  the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes.
  Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images.'
