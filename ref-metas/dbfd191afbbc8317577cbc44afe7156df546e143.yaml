paperAbstract: 'We describe a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy
  lexical relation from unrestricted text. Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidance
  of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range
  of text. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable,
  that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate
  the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns
  and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way. A
  subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment
  and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications
  to areas such as information retrieval are suggested.'
