paperAbstract: We develop a framework for learning generic, expressive image priors
  that capture the statistics of natural scenes and can be used for a variety of machine
  vision tasks. The approach extends traditional Markov random field (MRF) models
  by learning potential functions over extended pixel neighborhoods. Field potentials
  are modeled using a Products-of-Experts framework that exploits nonlinear functions
  of many linear filter responses. In contrast to previous MRF approaches all parameters,
  including the linear filters themselves, are learned from training data. We demonstrate
  the capabilities of this Field of Experts model with two example applications, image
  denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approximate
  inference scheme. While the model is trained on a generic image database and is
  not tuned toward a specific application, we obtain results that compete with and
  even outperform specialized techniques.
