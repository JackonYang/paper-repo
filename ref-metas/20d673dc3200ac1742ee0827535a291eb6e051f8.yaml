paperAbstract: The earlier introduced arithmetic coding idea has been generalized
  to a very broad and flexible coding technique which includes virtually all known
  variable rate noiseless coding techniques as special cases. An outstanding feature
  of this technique is that alphabet extensions are not required. A complete decodability
  analysis is given. The relationship of arithmetic coding to other known nonblock
  codes is illuminated.
