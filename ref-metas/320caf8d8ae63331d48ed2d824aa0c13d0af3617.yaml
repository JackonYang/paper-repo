paperAbstract: Human action in video sequences can be seen as silhouettes of a moving
  torso and protruding limbs undergoing articulated motion. We regard human actions
  as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume.
  We adopt a recent approach [14] for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal
  with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the
  solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time
  saliency, action dynamics, shape structure, and orientation. We show that these
  features are useful for action recognition, detection, and clustering. The method
  is fast, does not require video alignment, and is applicable in (but not limited
  to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness
  of our method to partial occlusions, nonrigid deformations, significant changes
  in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action, and
  low-quality video.
