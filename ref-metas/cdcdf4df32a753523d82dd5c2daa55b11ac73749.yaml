paperAbstract: 'Automatic document layout analysis is a crucial step in cognitive
  computing and processes that extract information out of document images, such as
  specific-domain knowledge database creation, graphs and images understanding, extraction
  of structured data from tables, and others. Even with the progress observed in this
  field in the last years, challenges are still open and range from accurately detecting
  content boxes to classifying them into semantically meaningful classes. With the
  popularization of mobile devices and cloud-based services, the need for approaches
  that are both fast and economic in data usage is a reality. In this paper we propose
  a fast one-dimensional approach for automatic document layout analysis considering
  text, figures and tables based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We take advantage
  of the inherently one-dimensional pattern observed in text and table blocks to reduce
  the dimension analysis from bi-dimensional documents images to 1D signatures, improving
  significantly the overall performance: we present considerably faster execution
  times and more compact data usage with no loss in overall accuracy if compared with
  a classical bidimensional CNN approach.'
