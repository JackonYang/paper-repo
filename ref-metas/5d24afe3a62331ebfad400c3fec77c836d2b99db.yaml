paperAbstract: Representations for semantic information about words are necessary
  for many applications of neural networks in natural language processing. This paper
  describes an efficient, corpus-based method for inducing distributed semantic representations
  for a large number of words (50,000) from lexical coccurrence statistics by means
  of a large-scale linear regression. The representations are successfully applied
  to word sense disambiguation using a nearest neighbor method.
