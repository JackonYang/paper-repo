paperAbstract: Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of unstable
  classifiers such as trees or neural nets results in reduced test set error. To study
  this, the concepts of bias and variance of a classifier are defined. Unstable classifiers
  can have universally low bias. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple
  versions is a variance reducing device. One of the most effective is bagging (Breiman
  [1996a]) Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original
  training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined
  by voting. Freund and Schapire [1995,1996] propose an algorithm the basis of which
  is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym-arcing) so that the weights
  in the resampling are increased for those cases most often missclassified and the
  combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more sucessful than bagging in variance
  reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging,
  and try to understand how arcing works.
