paperAbstract: "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010\
  linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their\
  \ responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually\
  \ dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the\
  \ grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated\
  \ stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency\
  \ and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating\
  \ is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity\
  \ to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive\
  \ fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that\
  \ stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles\
  \ of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis\
  \ of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially\
  \ antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization\
  \ of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their\
  \ receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex\
  \ cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of\
  \ its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter\
  \ of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one\
  \ bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit\
  \ small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective.\
  \ In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute\
  \ positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a\
  \ manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars.\
  \ 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's\
  \ response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds\
  \ closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the\
  \ cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial\
  \ characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined\
  \ the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010\
  line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some\
  \ time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits\
  \ interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of\
  \ one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex\
  \ receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities\
  \ of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine\
  \ these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."
