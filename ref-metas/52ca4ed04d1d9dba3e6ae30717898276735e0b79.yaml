paperAbstract: In this work we scrutinize a low level computer vision task - non-maximum
  suppression (NMS) - which is a crucial preprocessing step in many computer vision
  applications. Especially in real time scenarios, efficient algorithms for such preprocessing
  algorithms, which operate on the full image resolution, are important. In the case
  of NMS, it seems that merely the straightforward implementation or slight improvements
  are known. We show that these are far from being optimal, and derive several algorithms
  ranging from easy-to-implement to highly-efficient
