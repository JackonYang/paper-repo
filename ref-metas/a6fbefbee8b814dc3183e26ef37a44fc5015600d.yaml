paperAbstract: 'While many algorithms for computing stereo correspondence have been
  proposed, there has been very little work on experimentally evaluating algorithm
  performance, especially using real (rather than synthetic) imagery. In this paper
  we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We
  use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths
  and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense
  ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University
  of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we
  built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the
  notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an
  (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input
  pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques
  based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that
  the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional
  materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the
  web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/~szeliski/stereo.'
