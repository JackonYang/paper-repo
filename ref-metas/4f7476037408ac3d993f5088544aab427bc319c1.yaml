paperAbstract: 'Abstract : At this early stage in the development of cognitive science,
  methodological issues are both open and central. There may have been times when
  developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced
  researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering
  the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced
  the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these
  methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction
  that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive
  science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of
  many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body
  of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual
  insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those
  insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which
  I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is
  a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory
  of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation
  provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including
  languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them.'
