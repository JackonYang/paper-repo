paperAbstract: In this paper, we present IdentiFinderTM, a hidden Markov model that
  learns to recognize and classify names, dates, times, and numerical quantities.
  We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh
  Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish
  (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]),
  and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard
  materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely,
  MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other
  learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based
  on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information
  is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of
  training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words
  of training data is adequate to get performance around 90% on newswire. Although
  we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class
  of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be
  possible.
