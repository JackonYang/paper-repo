paperAbstract: We investigate to what extent combinations of features can improve
  classification performance on a large dataset of similar classes. To this end we
  introduce a 103 class flower dataset. We compute four different features for the
  flowers, each describing different aspects, namely the local shape/texture, the
  shape of the boundary, the overall spatial distribution of petals, and the colour.
  We combine the features using a multiple kernel framework with a SVM classifier.
  The weights for each class are learnt using the method of Varma and Ray, which has
  achieved state of the art performance on other large dataset, such as Caltech 101/256.
  Our dataset has a similar challenge in the number of classes, but with the added
  difficulty of large between class similarity and small within class similarity.
  Results show that learning the optimum kernel combination of multiple features vastly
  improves the performance, from 55.1% for the best single feature to 72.8% for the
  combination of all features.
