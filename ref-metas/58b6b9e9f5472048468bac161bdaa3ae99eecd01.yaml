paperAbstract: "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted\
  \ range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure\
  \ on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats\
  \ images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must\
  \ be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically\
  \ formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it\
  \ is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images\
  \ (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint\
  \ that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished,\
  \ is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion\
  \ equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order).\
  \ As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of\
  \ the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by\
  \ iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes\
  \ less articulated because the extrem (\u201Clight and dark blobs\u201D) disappear\
  \ one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar\
  \ in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested\
  \ set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution\
  \ in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits\
  \ a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple\
  \ scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to\
  \ an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure\
  \ is apt for the description of size invariances."
