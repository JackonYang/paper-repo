paperAbstract: Given a query image of an object, our objective is to retrieve all
  instances of that object in a large (1M+) image database. We adopt the bag-of-visual-words
  architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall.
  Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can
  result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images
  of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature
  a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the
  highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In
  this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of
  blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents
  are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into
  the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints
  between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return,
  suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion.
  Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable
  the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the
  5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr
  images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall
  in many cases.
