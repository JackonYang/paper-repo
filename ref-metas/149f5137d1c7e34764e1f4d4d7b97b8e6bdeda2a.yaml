paperAbstract: "This thesis describes a novel statistical named-entity (i.e. \u201C\
  proper name\u201D) recognition system known as \u201CMENE\u201D (Maximum Entropy\
  \ Named Entity). Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction\
  \ in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name,\
  \ organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201Cnone\
  \ of the above\u201D. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines,\
  \ machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation\
  \ for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant\
  \ problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of\
  \ portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported\
  \ frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to\
  \ build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal\
  \ programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy\
  \ in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through\
  \ the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible\
  \ object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge\
  \ sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity\
  \ evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median,\
  \ demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate\
  \ that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of\
  \ a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved\
  \ on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when\
  \ all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve\
  \ very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human\
  \ performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system.\
  \ We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which\
  \ involved a new named entity category, \u201Cartifact\u201D. Our results on these\
  \ tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers\
  \ despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."
