paperAbstract: In this paper, we present and compare various alignment models for
  statistical machine translation. We propose to measure the quality of an alignment
  model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment compared to a manually-produced
  alignment and describe a refined annotation scheme to produce suitable reference
  alignments. We also compare the impact of different alignment models on the translation
  quality of a statistical machine translation system.
