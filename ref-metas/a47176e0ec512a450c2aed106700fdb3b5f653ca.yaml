paperAbstract: The general problem of drawing inferences from uncertain or incomplete
  evidence has invited a variety of technical approaches, some mathematically rigorous
  and some largely informal and intuitive. Most current inference systems in artificial
  intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate
  statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts.
  We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some
  of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest
  are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections
  of subjective statements.
