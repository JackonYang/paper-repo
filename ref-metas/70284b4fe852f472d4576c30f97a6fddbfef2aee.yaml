paperAbstract: We question the role that large scale filter banks have traditionally
  played in texture classification. It is demonstrated that textures can be classified
  using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods
  (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms
  classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton
  based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution
  for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify
  novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power
  of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures
  present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses
  that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik,
  Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman.
