paperAbstract: We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single
  deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding
  boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature
  map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence
  of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box
  to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions
  from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects
  of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object
  proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel
  or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network.
  This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that
  require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO,
  and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize
  an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified
  framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods,
  SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\times
  300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X
  and for $500\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable
  state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Code is available at this https URL .
