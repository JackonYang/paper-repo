paperAbstract: The complex compositional structure of language makes problems at the
  intersection of vision and language challenging. But language also provides a strong
  prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models
  truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder progress in pushing state
  of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal AI. In this paper, we address
  binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on abstract scenes. We formulate this problem
  as visual verification of concepts inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert
  the question to a tuple that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected
  in the image. If the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question
  is "yes", and otherwise "no". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to
  focus on the highlevel semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level recognition
  problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the modality to balance
  the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and the role of vision is
  essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs of scenes for every question,
  such that the answer to the question is "yes" for one scene, and "no" for the other
  for the exact same question. Indeed, language priors alone do not perform better
  than chance on our balanced dataset. Moreover, our proposed approach matches the
  performance of a state-of-the-art VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms
  it on the balanced dataset.
