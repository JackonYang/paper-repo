paperAbstract: 'This paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem
  of named entity classification. A large number of rules is needed for coverage of
  the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be
  required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data
  can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple "seed" rules. The approach
  gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances
  both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient
  to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar
  algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell
  98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised
  learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98).'
