paperAbstract: Research and development of information access technology for scanned
  paper documents has been hampered by the lack of public test collections of realistic
  scope and complexity. As part of a project to create a prototype system for search
  and mining of masses of document images, we are assembling a 1.5 terabyte dataset
  to support evaluation of both end-to-end complex document information processing
  (CDIP) tasks (e.g., text retrieval and data mining) as well as component technologies
  such as optical character recognition (OCR), document structure analysis, signature
  matching, and authorship attribution.
