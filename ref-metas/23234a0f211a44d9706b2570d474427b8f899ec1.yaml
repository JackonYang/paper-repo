paperAbstract: A novel learning approach for human face detection using a network
  of linear units is presented. The SNoW learning architecture is a sparse network
  of linear functions over a pre-defined or incrementally learned feature space and
  is specifically tailored for learning in the presence of a very large number of
  features. A wide range of face images in different poses, with different expressions
  and under different lighting conditions are used as a training set to capture the
  variations of human faces. Experimental results on commonly used benchmark data
  sets of a wide range of face images show that the SNoW-based approach outperforms
  methods that use neural networks, Bayesian methods, support vector machines and
  others. Furthermore, learning and evaluation using the SNoW-based method are significantly
  more efficient than with other methods.
