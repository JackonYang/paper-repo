paperAbstract: A database of continuous read speech has been designed and recorded
  within the DARPA strategic computing speech recognition program. The data is intended
  for use in designing and evaluating algorithms for speaker-independent, speaker-adaptive
  and speaker-dependent speech recognition. The data consists of read sentences appropriate
  to a naval resource management task built around existing interactive database and
  graphics programs. The 1000-word task vocabulary is intended to be logically complete
  and habitable. The database, which represents over 21000 recorded utterances from
  160 talkers with a variety of dialects, includes a partition of sentences and talkers
  for training and for testing purposes.<<ETX>>
