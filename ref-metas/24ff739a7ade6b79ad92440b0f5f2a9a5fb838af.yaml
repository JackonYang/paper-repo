paperAbstract: A mudflap assembly for use with a dump vehicle having dual tires at
  the rear end thereof and including a pair of flexible flap sections one of which
  is supported by a rigid member adjacent the dual tires and the other is located
  above and to the rear of the rigid member and is secured at its upper end to the
  dump body. The rigid member is pivotally connected to the dump body and is combined
  with a cable which assures that the attached flap section maintains substantially
  the same position when the dump body is in the lowered-carry-position or raised-dump-position.
