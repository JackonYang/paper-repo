paperAbstract: 'Abstract : In this thesis we study the general problem of reconstructing
  a function, defined on a finite lattice, from a set of incomplete, noisy and/or
  ambiguous observations. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the generality and
  practical value of a probabilistic (in particular, Bayesian) approach to this problem,
  particularly in the context of Computer Vision. In this approach, the prior knowledge
  about the solution is expressed in the form of a Gibbsian probability distribution
  on the space of all possible functions, so that the reconstruction task in formulated
  as an estimation problem. Keywords: Inverse problems; Computer vision; Surface interpolation;
  Image restoration; Markov random fields; Optimal estimation; Simulated annealing.'
