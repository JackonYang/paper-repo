paperAbstract: A test sequence is used to select the best rule from a class of discrimination
  rules defined in terms of the training sequence. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis and related
  inequalities are used to obtain distribution-free bounds on the difference between
  the probability of error of the selected rule and the probability of error of the
  best rule in the given class. The bounds are used to prove the consistency and asymptotic
  optimality for several popular classes, including linear discriminators, nearest-neighbor
  rules, kernel-based rules, histogram rules, binary tree classifiers, and Fourier
  series classifiers. In particular, the method can be used to choose the smoothing
  parameter in kernel-based rules, to choose k in the k-nearest neighbor rule, and
  to choose between parametric and nonparametric rules. >
