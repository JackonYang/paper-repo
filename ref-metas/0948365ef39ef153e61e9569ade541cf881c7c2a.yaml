paperAbstract: Kernel-based learning algorithms work by embedding the data into a
  Euclidean space, and then searching for linear relations among the embedded data
  points. The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products
  between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained
  in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that
  encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to
  specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity
  in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In
  this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite
  programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both
  training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the
  labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part.
  The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels.
  Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning
  both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach
  leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter
  in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.
