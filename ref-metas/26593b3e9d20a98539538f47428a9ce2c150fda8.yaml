paperAbstract: "This paper concerns random systems made up out of a finite collection\
  \ of elements. We are interested in how a fixed structure of interactions reflects\
  \ on the assignment of probabilities to overall states. In particular, we consider\
  \ two simple models of random systems: one generalizing the notion of \u201CGibbs\
  \ ensemble\u201D abstracted from statistical physics; the other, \u201CMarkov fields\u201D\
  \ derived from the idea of a Markov chain. We give background for these two types,\
  \ review proofs that they are in fact identical for systems with nonzero probabilities,\
  \ and explore the new behavior that arises with constraints. Finally, we discuss\
  \ unsolved problems and make suggestions for further work."
