paperAbstract: "The objective of the ACE program is to develop technology to automatically\
  \ infer from human language data the entities being mentioned, the relations among\
  \ these entities that are directly expressed, and the events in which these entities\
  \ participate. Data sources include audio and image data in addition to pure text,\
  \ and Arabic and Chinese in addition to English. The effort involves defining the\
  \ research tasks in detail, collecting and annotating data needed for training,\
  \ development, and evaluation, and supporting the research with evaluation tools\
  \ and research workshops. This program began with a pilot study in 1999. The next\
  \ evaluation is scheduled for September 2004. Introduction and Background Today\u2019\
  s global web of electronic information, including most notably the www, provides\
  \ a resource of unbounded information-bearing potential. But to fully exploit this\
  \ potential requires the ability to extract content from human language automatically.\
  \ That is the objective of the ACE program \u2013 to develop the capability to extract\
  \ meaning from multimedia sources. These sources include text, audio and image data.\
  \ The ACE program is a \u201Ctechnocentric\u201D research effort, meaning that the\
  \ emphasis is on developing core enabling technologies rather than solving the application\
  \ needs that motivate the research. The program began in 1999 with a study intended\
  \ to identify those key content extraction tasks to serve as the research targets\
  \ for the remainder of the program. These tasks were identified in general as the\
  \ extraction of the entities, relations and events being discussed in the language.\
  \ In general objective, the ACE program is motivated by and addresses the same issues\
  \ as the MUC program that preceded it (NIST 1999). The ACE program, however, attempts\
  \ to take the task \u201Coff the page\u201D in the sense that the research objectives\
  \ are defined in terms of the target objects (i.e., the entities, the relations,\
  \ and the events) rather than in terms of the words in the text. For example, the\
  \ so-called \u201Cnamed entity\u201D task, as defined in MUC, is to identify those\
  \ words (on the page) that are names of entities. In ACE, on the other hand, the\
  \ corresponding task is to identify the entity so named. This is a different task,\
  \ one that is more abstract and that involves inference more explicitly in producing\
  \ an answer. In a real sense, the task is to detect things that \u201Caren\u2019\
  t there\u201D. Reference resolution thus becomes an integral and critical part of\
  \ solving the problem. During the period 2000-2001, the ACE effort was devoted solely\
  \ to entity detection and tracking. During the period 2002-2003, relations were\
  \ explored and added. 1 While the ACE program is directed toward extraction of information\
  \ from audio and image sources in addition to pure text, the research effort is\
  \ restricted to information extraction from text. The actual transduction of audio\
  \ and image data into text is not part of the ACE research effort, although the\
  \ processing of ASR and OCR output from such transducers is. Now, starting in 2004,\
  \ events are being explored and added as the third of the three original tasks."
