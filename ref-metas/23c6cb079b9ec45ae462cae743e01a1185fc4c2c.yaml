paperAbstract: Current methods for learning visual categories work well when a large
  amount of labeled data is available, but can run into severe difficulties when the
  number of labeled examples is small. When labeled data is scarce it may be beneficial
  to use unlabeled data to learn an image representation that is low-dimensional,
  but nevertheless captures the information required to discriminate between image
  categories. This paper describes a method for learning representations from large
  quantities of unlabeled images which have associated captions; the goal is to improve
  learning in future image classification problems. Experiments show that our method
  significantly outperforms (1) a fully-supervised baseline model, (2) a model that
  ignores the captions and learns a visual representation by performing PCA on the
  unlabeled images alone and (3) a model that uses the output of word classifiers
  trained using captions and unlabeled data. Our current work concentrates on captions
  as the source of meta-data, but more generally other types of meta-data could be
  used.
