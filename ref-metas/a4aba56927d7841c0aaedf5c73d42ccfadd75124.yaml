paperAbstract: "We investigate the problem of automatically labelling appearances\
  \ of characters in TV or film material. This is tremendously challenging due to\
  \ the huge variation in imaged appearance of each character and the weakness and\
  \ ambiguity of available annotation. However, we demonstrate that high precision\
  \ can be achieved by combining multiple sources of information, both visual and\
  \ textual. The principal novelties that we introduce are: (i) automatic generation\
  \ of time stamped character annotation by aligning subtitles and transcripts; (ii)\
  \ strengthening the supervisory information by identifying when characters are speaking;\
  \ (iii) using complementary cues of face matching and clothing matching to propose\
  \ common annotations for face tracks. Results are presented on episodes of the TV\
  \ series \u201CBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201D."
