paperAbstract: An algorithm for the analysis of multivariate data is presented along
  with some experimental results. The algorithm is based upon a point mapping of N
  L-dimensional vectors from the L-space to a lower-dimensional space such that the
  inherent data "structure" is approximately preserved.
