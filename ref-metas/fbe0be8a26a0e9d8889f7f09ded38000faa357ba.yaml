paperAbstract: A technique for image segmentation using shape-directed covers is described
  and applied to the fully automatic analysis of complex printed-page layouts. The
  structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration
  of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally
  expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves
  an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial
  engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles
  to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines
  a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page
  segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often
  occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This
  is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently
  emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>
