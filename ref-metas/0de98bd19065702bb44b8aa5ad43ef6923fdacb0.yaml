paperAbstract: We describe the current state of a system that recognizes printed text
  of various fonts and sizes for the Roman alphabet. The system combines several techniques
  in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction
  are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image.
  The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach,
  into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier.
  Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance
  on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over
  a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through
  contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified.
  Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated
  by sample pages.
