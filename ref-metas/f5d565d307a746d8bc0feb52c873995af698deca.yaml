paperAbstract: "When labelled training data is plentiful, discriminative techniques\
  \ are widely used since they give excellent generalization performance. However,\
  \ for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data\
  \ is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on\
  \ generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although\
  \ the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by \u2018\
  training them discriminatively\u2019, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled\
  \ data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative\
  \ approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between\
  \ these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative\
  \ objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that\
  \ there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a \u2018discriminatively\
  \ trained\u2019 generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint,\
  \ generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior\
  \ over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of \u2018discriminative\
  \ training\u2019, this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating\
  \ between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of\
  \ prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical\
  \ example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that,\
  \ when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance\
  \ corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative."
