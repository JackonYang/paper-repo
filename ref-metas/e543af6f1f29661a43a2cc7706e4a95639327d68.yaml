paperAbstract: 'This article explores the effects of perceptual grouping on search
  for targets defined by separate features or by conjunction of features. Treisman
  and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that
  in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly
  combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items
  are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather
  than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could
  generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions,
  subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning
  rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that
  it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for
  features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting
  that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged
  at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups,
  each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping
  creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global
  configuration.'
