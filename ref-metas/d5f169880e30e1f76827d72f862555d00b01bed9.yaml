paperAbstract: In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching environment where
  stored entities (documents) are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
  (search requests), it appears that the best indexing (property) space is one where
  each entity lies as far away from the others as possible; in these circumstances
  the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of the density
  of the object space; in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
  with space density. An approach based on space density computations is used to choose
  an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. Typical evaluation
  results are shown, demonstating the usefulness of the model.
