paperAbstract: As robots become more ubiquitous and capable, it becomes ever more
  important for untrained users to easily interact with them. Recently, this has led
  to study of the language grounding problem, where the goal is to extract representations
  of the meanings of natural language tied to the physical world. We present an approach
  for joint learning of language and perception models for grounded attribute induction.
  The perception model includes classifiers for physical characteristics and a language
  model based on a probabilistic categorial grammar that enables the construction
  of compositional meaning representations. We evaluate on the task of interpreting
  sentences that describe sets of objects in a physical workspace, and demonstrate
  accurate task performance and effective latent-variable concept induction in physical
  grounded scenes.
