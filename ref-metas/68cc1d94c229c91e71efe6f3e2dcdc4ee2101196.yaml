paperAbstract: An efficient method for text localization and recognition in real-world
  images is proposed. Thanks to effective pruning, it is able to exhaustively search
  the space of all character sequences in real time (200ms on a 640x480 image). The
  method exploits higher-order properties of text such as word text lines. We demonstrate
  that the grouping stage plays a key role in the text localization performance and
  that a robust and precise grouping stage is able to compensate errors of the character
  detector. The method includes a novel selector of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions
  (MSER) which exploits region topology. Experimental validation shows that 95.7%
  characters in the ICDAR dataset are detected using the novel selector of MSERs with
  a low sensitivity threshold. The proposed method was evaluated on the standard ICDAR
  2003 dataset where it achieved state-of-the-art results in both text localization
  and recognition.
