paperAbstract: A common practice to gain invariant features in object recognition
  models is to aggregate multiple low-level features over a small neighborhood. However,
  the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different
  aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions
  by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition
  tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms
  subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling
  windows are no significant improvement over nonoverlapping pooling windows. By applying
  this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57% on the NORB normalized-uniform
  dataset and 5.6% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset.
