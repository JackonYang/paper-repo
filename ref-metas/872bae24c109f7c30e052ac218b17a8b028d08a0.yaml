paperAbstract: Denoising autoencoders have been previously shown to be competitive
  alternatives to restricted Boltzmann machines for unsupervised pretraining of each
  layer of a deep architecture. We show that a simple denoising autoencoder training
  criterion is equivalent to matching the score (with respect to the data) of a specific
  energy-based model to that of a nonparametric Parzen density estimator of the data.
  This yields several useful insights. It defines a proper probabilistic model for
  the denoising autoencoder technique, which makes it in principle possible to sample
  from them or rank examples by their energy. It suggests a different way to apply
  score matching that is related to learning to denoise and does not require computing
  second derivatives. It justifies the use of tied weights between the encoder and
  decoder and suggests ways to extend the success of denoising autoencoders to a larger
  family of energy-based models.
