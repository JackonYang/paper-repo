paperAbstract: Vertex is a Wrapper Induction system developed at Yahoo! for extracting
  structured records from template-based Web pages. To operate at Web scale, Vertex
  employs a host of novel algorithms for (1) Grouping similar structured pages in
  a Web site, (2) Picking the appropriate sample pages for wrapper inference, (3)
  Learning XPath-based extraction rules that are robust to variations in site structure,
  (4) Detecting site changes by monitoring sample pages, and (5) Optimizing editorial
  costs by reusing rules, etc. The system is deployed in production and currently
  extracts more than 250 million records from more than 200 Web sites. To the best
  of our knowledge, Vertex is the first system to do high-precision information extraction
  at Web scale.
