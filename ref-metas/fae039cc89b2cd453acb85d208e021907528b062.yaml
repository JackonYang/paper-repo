paperAbstract: "For four years, ISRI has conducted an annual test of optical character\
  \ recognition (OCR) systems known as \u201Cpage readers.\u201D These systems accept\
  \ as input a bitmapped image of any document page, and attempt to identify the machine-printed\
  \ characters on the page. In the annual test, we measure the accuracy of this process\
