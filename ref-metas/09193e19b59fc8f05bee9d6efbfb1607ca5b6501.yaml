paperAbstract: "We address a central problem of neuroanatomy, namely, the automatic\
  \ segmentation of neuronal structures depicted in stacks of electron microscopy\
  \ (EM) images. This is necessary to efficiently map 3D brain structure and connectivity.\
  \ To segment biological neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep artificial\
  \ neural network as a pixel classifier. The label of each pixel (membrane or non-membrane)\
  \ is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input\
  \ layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional\
  \ and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with\
  \ increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability\
  \ for each class. The classifier is trained by plain gradient descent on a 512 \xD7\
  \ 512 \xD7 30 stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same size\
  \ (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation\
  \ Challenge. Even without problem-specific postprocessing, our approach outperforms\
  \ competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. rand\
  \ error, warping error and pixel error. For pixel error, our approach is the only\
  \ one outperforming a second human observer."
