paperAbstract: Current people detectors operate either by scanning an image in a sliding
  window fashion or by classifying a discrete set of proposals. We propose a model
  that is based on decoding an image into a set of people detections. Our system takes
  an image as input and directly outputs a set of distinct detection hypotheses. Because
  we generate predictions jointly, common post-processing steps such as nonmaximum
  suppression are unnecessary. We use a recurrent LSTM layer for sequence generation
  and train our model end-to-end with a new loss function that operates on sets of
  detections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
  task of detecting people in crowded scenes1.
