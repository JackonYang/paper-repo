paperAbstract: Most of the existing approaches to collaborative filtering cannot handle
  very large data sets. In this paper we show how a class of two-layer undirected
  graphical models, called Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM's), can be used to model
  tabular data, such as user's ratings of movies. We present efficient learning and
  inference procedures for this class of models and demonstrate that RBM's can be
  successfully applied to the Netflix data set, containing over 100 million user/movie
  ratings. We also show that RBM's slightly outperform carefully-tuned SVD models.
  When the predictions of multiple RBM models and multiple SVD models are linearly
  combined, we achieve an error rate that is well over 6% better than the score of
  Netflix's own system.
