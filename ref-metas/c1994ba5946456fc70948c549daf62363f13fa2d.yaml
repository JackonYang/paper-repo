paperAbstract: We present an approach to interpret the major surfaces, objects, and
  support relations of an indoor scene from an RGBD image. Most existing work ignores
  physical interactions or is applied only to tidy rooms and hallways. Our goal is
  to parse typical, often messy, indoor scenes into floor, walls, supporting surfaces,
  and object regions, and to recover support relationships. One of our main interests
  is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation.
  We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support
  relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor
  scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer
  support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred
  support lead to better object segmentation.
