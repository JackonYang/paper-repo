paperAbstract: We present a robust method for automatically matching features in images
  corresponding to the same physical point on an object seen from two arbitrary viewpoints.
  Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about
  the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this
  is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features
  are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants.
  The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature
  characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including
  rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion
  application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing
  the number of feature matches.
