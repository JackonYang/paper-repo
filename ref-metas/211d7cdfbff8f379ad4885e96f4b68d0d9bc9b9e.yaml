  erent layout arrangements can b e thought of as expressing functional asp ects of

  we conventionally read tables from the left and from the top, we distinguish theleft

  as the functional part of the table.Thus,while a single canonical form may have
  many layouts, a given canonical form plus functionalinformation will have a much
