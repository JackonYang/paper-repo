paperAbstract: Hidden Markov Models HMMs are statistical models of sequential data
  that have been used successfully in many machine learning applications especially
  for speech recognition Further more in the last few years many new and promising
  probabilistic models related to HMMs have been proposed We rst summarize the basics
  of HMMs and then review several recent related learning algorithms and extensions
  of HMMs including in particular hybrids of HMMs with arti cial neural networks Input
  Output HMMs which are conditional HMMs using neu ral networks to compute probabilities
  weighted transducers variable length Markov models and Markov switching state space
  models Finally we discuss some of the challenges of future research in this very
  active area
