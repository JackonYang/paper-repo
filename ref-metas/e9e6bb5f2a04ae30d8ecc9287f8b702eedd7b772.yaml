paperAbstract: "Abstract A new signature-table technique is described together with\
  \ an improved book-learning procedure which is thought to be much superior to the\
  \ linear polynomial method. Full use is made of the so-called \u201Calpha-beta\u201D\
  \ pruning and several forms of forward pruning to restrict the spread of the move\

  \ ability has been greatly improved.tplay checker masters, the"
