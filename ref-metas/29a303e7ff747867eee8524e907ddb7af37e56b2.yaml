paperAbstract: 'We consider the problem of segmenting an image into foreground and
  background, with foreground containing solely objects of interest known a priori.
  We propose an integration model that incorporates both edge detection and object
  part detection results. It consists of two parallel processes: low-level pixel grouping
  and high-level patch grouping. We seek a solution that optimizes a joint grouping
  criterion in a reduced space enforced by grouping correspondence between pixels
  and patches. Using spectral graph partitioning, we show that a near global optimum
  can be found by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We report promising experimental
  results on a dataset of 15 objects under clutter and occlusion.'
