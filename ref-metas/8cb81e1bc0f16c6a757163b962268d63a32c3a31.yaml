paperAbstract: While in classical optics the problem is to determine the images of
  physical objects, vision is confronted with the inverse problem of recovering three-dimensional
  shape from the light distribution in the image. Most processes of early vision such
  as stereomatching, computation of motion and all the ``structure from" processes
  can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of
  early vision can be formalized---{\it most early vision problems are ``ill-posed
  problems" in the sense of Hadamard}. We will show that a mathematical theory developed
  for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early
  vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a
  new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained
  in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems
  in early vision can be approached and solved.
