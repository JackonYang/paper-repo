paperAbstract: We present an attention-based model for recognizing multiple objects
  in images. The proposed model is a deep recurrent neural network trained with reinforcement
  learning to attend to the most relevant regions of the input image. We show that
  the model learns to both localize and recognize multiple objects despite being given
  only class labels during training. We evaluate the model on the challenging task
  of transcribing house number sequences from Google Street View images and show that
  it is both more accurate than the state-of-the-art convolutional networks and uses
  fewer parameters and less computation.
