paperAbstract: This paper describes an interactive vision system for a robot that
  finds an object specified by a user and brings it to the user. The system first
  registers object models automatically. When the user specifies an object, the system
  tries to recognize the object automatically. When the recognition result is shown
  to the user, the user may provide additional information via speech such as pointing
  out mistakes, choosing the correct object from multiple candidates, or giving the
  relative position of the object. Based on the advice, the system tries again to
  recognize the object. Experiments are described using real-world refrigerator scenes.
