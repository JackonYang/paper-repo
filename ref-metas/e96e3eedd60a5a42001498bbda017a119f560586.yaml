paperAbstract: "When stimuli are available for just a brief period (\u223C100 ms)\
  \ only restricted spatial information can be processed by the visual system. If\
  \ the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time\
  \ during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated\
  \ by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a\
  \ small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others,\
  \ only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local\
  \ features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of\
  \ the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating.\
  \ Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires\
  \ focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled\
  \ to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."
