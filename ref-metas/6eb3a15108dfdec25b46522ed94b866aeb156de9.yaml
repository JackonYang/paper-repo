paperAbstract: We propose a semi-supervised model which segments and annotates images
  using very few labeled images and a large unaligned text corpus to relate image
  regions to text labels. Given photos of a sports event, all that is necessary to
  provide a pixel-level labeling of objects and background is a set of newspaper articles
  about this sport and one to five labeled images. Our model is motivated by the observation
  that words in text corpora share certain context and feature similarities with visual
  objects. We describe images using visual words, a new region-based representation.
  The proposed model is based on kernelized canonical correlation analysis which finds
  a mapping between visual and textual words by projecting them into a latent meaning
  space. Kernels are derived from context and adjective features inside the respective
  visual and textual domains. We apply our method to a challenging dataset and rely
  on articles of the New York Times for textual features. Our model outperforms the
  state-of-the-art in annotation. In segmentation it compares favorably with other
  methods that use significantly more labeled training data.
