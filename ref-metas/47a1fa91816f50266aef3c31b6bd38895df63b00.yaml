paperAbstract: In recent years, we have seen tremendous progress in the field of object
  detection. Most of the recent improvements have been achieved by targeting deeper
  feedforward networks. However, many hard object categories such as bottle, remote,
  etc. require representation of fine details and not just coarse, semantic representations.
  But most of these fine details are lost in the early convolutional layers. What
  we need is a way to incorporate finer details from lower layers into the detection
  architecture. Skip connections have been proposed to combine high-level and low-level
  features, but we argue that selecting the right features from low-level requires
  top-down contextual information. Inspired by the human visual pathway, in this paper
  we propose top-down modulations as a way to incorporate fine details into the detection
  framework. Our approach supplements the standard bottom-up, feedforward ConvNet
  with a top-down modulation (TDM) network, connected using lateral connections. These
  connections are responsible for the modulation of lower layer filters, and the top-down
  network handles the selection and integration of contextual information and low-level
  features. The proposed TDM architecture provides a significant boost on the COCO
  testdev benchmark, achieving 28.6 AP for VGG16, 35.2 AP for ResNet101, and 37.3
  for InceptionResNetv2 network, without any bells and whistles (e.g., multi-scale,
  iterative box refinement, etc.).
