paperAbstract: Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown
  function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k > 2 values (i.e., k "classes").
  The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form
  (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct
  application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and
  CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary
  functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning
  algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three
  approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a
  distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve
  the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range
  of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with
  respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed
  representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance
  techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other
  methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability
  estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output
  codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive
  learning programs on multiclass problems.
