paperAbstract: A model of machine learning in which the concept to be learned may
  exhibit uncertain or probabilistic behavior is investigated. Such probabilistic
  concepts (or p-concepts) may arise in situations such as weather prediction, where
  the measured variables and their accuracy are insufficient to determine the outcome
  with certainty. It is required that learning algorithms be both efficient and general
  in the sense that they perform well for a wide class of p-concepts and for any distribution
  over the domain. Many efficient algorithms for learning natural classes of p-concepts
  are given, and an underlying theory of learning p-concepts is developed in detail.<<ETX>>
