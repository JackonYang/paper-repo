paperAbstract: This paper discusses the problem of the minimization of the distortion
  of a signal by a quantizer when the number of output levels of the quantizer is
  fixed. The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error
  between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the
  parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble
  without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify
  their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed
  amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed
  and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of
  a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally
  spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case
  as above.
