paperAbstract: This paper describes an accurate, relatively inexpensive method for
  the disambiguation of noun homographs using large text corpora. The algorithm checks
  the context surrounding the target noun against that of previously observed instances
  and chooses the sense for which the most evidence is found, where evidence consists
  of a set of orthographic, syntactic, and lexical features. Because the sense distinctions
  made are coarse, the disambiguation can be accomplished without the expense of knowledge
  bases or inference mechanisms. An implementation of the algorithm is described which,
  starting with a small set of hand-labeled instances, improves its results automatically
  via unsupervised training. The approach is compared to other attempts at homograph
  disambiguation using both machine readable dictionaries and unrestricted text and
  the use of training instances is determined to be a crucial di erence.
