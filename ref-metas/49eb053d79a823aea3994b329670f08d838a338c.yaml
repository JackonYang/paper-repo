paperAbstract: Scene text extraction methodologies are usually based in classification
  of individual regions or patches, using a priori knowledge for a given script or
  language. Human perception of text, on the other hand, is based on perceptual organisation
  through which text emerges as a perceptually significant group of atomic objects.
  Therefore humans are able to detect text even in languages and scripts never seen
  before. In this paper, we argue that the text extraction problem could be posed
  as the detection of meaningful groups of regions. We present a method built around
  a perceptual organisation framework that exploits collaboration of proximity and
  similarity laws to create text-group hypotheses. Experiments demonstrate that our
  algorithm is competitive with state of the art approaches on a standard dataset
  covering text in variable orientations and two languages.
