paperAbstract: "This paper presents a new approach to table structure recognition\
  \ as well as to layout analysis. The discussed recognition process differs significantly\
  \ from existing approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments,\
  \ whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of\
  \ some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page\
  \ from the top-down. The following analysis of the recognized layout elements is\
  \ based on the construction of a tile structure and detects row- and/or column spanning\
  \ cells as well as sparse tables with a high degree of confidence. \n \nThe overall\
  \ system is completely domain independent, optionally neglects textual contents\
  \ and can thus be applied to arbitrary mixed-mode documents (with or without tables)\
  \ of any language and even operates on low quality OCR documents (e.g. facsimiles)."
