paperAbstract: Object detection has seen huge progress in recent years, much thanks
  to the heavily-engineered Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. Can we
  go beyond gradients and do better than HOG? We provide an affirmative answer by
  proposing and investigating a sparse representation for object detection, Histograms
  of Sparse Codes (HSC). We compute sparse codes with dictionaries learned from data
  using K-SVD, and aggregate per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. We intentionally
  keep true to the sliding window framework (with mixtures and parts) and only change
  the underlying features. To keep training (and testing) efficient, we apply dimension
  reduction by computing SVD on learned models, and adopt supervised training where
  latent positions of roots and parts are given externally e.g. from a HOG-based detector.
  By learning and using local representations that are much more expressive than gradients,
  we demonstrate large improvements over the state of the art on the PASCAL benchmark
  for both root-only and part-based models.
