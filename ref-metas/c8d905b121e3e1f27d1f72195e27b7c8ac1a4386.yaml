paperAbstract: Bourdev and Malik (ICCV 09) introduced a new notion of parts, poselets,
  constructed to be tightly clustered both in the configuration space of keypoints,
  as well as in the appearance space of image patches. In this paper we develop a
  new algorithm for detecting people using poselets. Unlike that work which used 3D
  annotations of keypoints, we use only 2D annotations which are much easier for naive
  human annotators. The main algorithmic contribution is in how we use the pattern
  of poselet activations. Individual poselet activations are noisy, but considering
  the spatial context of each can provide vital disambiguating information, just as
  object detection can be improved by considering the detection scores of nearby objects
  in the scene. This can be done by training a two-layer feed-forward network with
  weights set using a max margin technique. The refined poselet activations are then
  clustered into mutually consistent hypotheses where consistency is based on empirically
  determined spatial keypoint distributions. Finally, bounding boxes are predicted
  for each person hypothesis and shape masks are aligned to edges in the image to
  provide a segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting system is the
  current best performer on the task of people detection and segmentation with an
  average precision of 47.8% and 40.5% respectively on PASCAL VOC 2009.
