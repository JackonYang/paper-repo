paperAbstract: 1. We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of
  the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior
  temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20)
  and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons
  were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality;
  21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic
  stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual
  receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached
  the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents.
  Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the
  body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli
  than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction
  of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons
  selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b)
  neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center
  of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons
  (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast.
  The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared
  to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large
  receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal
  responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions
  than in pattern recognition.
