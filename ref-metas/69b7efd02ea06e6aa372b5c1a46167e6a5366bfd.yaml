paperAbstract: Pfinder is a real-time system for tracking and interpretation of people.
  It runs on a standard SGI Indy computer, and has performed reliably on thousands
  of people in many different physical locations. The system uses a multi-class statistical
  model of color and shape to obtain a 2-D representation of head and hands in a wide
  range of viewing conditions. These representations are useful for applications such
  as wireless interfaces, video databases, and low-bandwidth coding, without cumbersome
  wires or attached sensors.
