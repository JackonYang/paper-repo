paperAbstract: The basic theory of Markov chains has been known to mathematicians
  and engineers for close to 80 years, but it is only in the past decade that it has
  been applied explicitly to problems in speech processing. One of the major reasons
  why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently
  was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match
  observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was
  immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued
  refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have
  greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models.
  It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of
  Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech
  recognition.
