paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of recognizing objects in large image
  databases. The method is based on local characteristics which are invariant to similarity
  transformations in the image. These characteristics are computed at automatically
  detected keypoints using the greyvalue signal. The method therefore works on images
  such as paintings for which geometry based recognition fails. Due to the locality
  of the method, images can be recognized being given part of an image and in the
  presence of occlusions. Applying a voting algorithm and semi-local constraints makes
  the method robust to noise, scene clutter and small perspective deformations. Experiments
  show an efficient recognition for different types of images. The approach has been
  validated on an image database containing 1020 images, some of them being very similar
  by structure, texture or shape.
