paperAbstract: "In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages\
  \ are generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some\
  \ sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction\
  \ in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or\
  \ both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses\
  \ three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks\
  \ influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised\
  \ or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired\
  \ filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of\
  \ feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include\
  \ rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient\
  \ for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of\
  \ feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show\
  \ that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate\
  \ on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are\
  \ used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art\
  \ performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised\
  \ refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226B 65%), and the lowest\
  \ known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."
