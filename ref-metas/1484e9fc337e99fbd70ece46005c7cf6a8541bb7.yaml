paperAbstract: In this paper a multiple frame based technique to enhance text in digital
  video is presented. After extracting a reference text block, we use an image matching
  technique to find the corresponding text blocks in consecutive frames. We register
  these text blocks to subpixel levels by using image interpolation techniques to
  improve both correspondence and text resolution. The registered text blocks are
  averaged to obtain a new text block with a clean background and a higher resolution.
  Experiments conducted on several video sequences show that our enhancement scheme
  can improve the accuracy of commercial off-the-shelf OCR considerably.
