paperAbstract: We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution
  (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution
  images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
  [15] that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution
  one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be
  viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle
  each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN
  has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality,
  and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage.
