paperAbstract: "The foreground group in a scene may be \u2018discovered\u2019 and\
  \ computed as a factorized approximation to the pairwise affinity of the elements\
  \ in the scene. A pointwise approximation of the pairwise affinity information may\
  \ in fact be interpreted as a \u2018saliency\u2019 index, and the foreground of\
  \ the scene may be obtained by thresholding it. An algorithm called \u2018affinity\
  \ factorization\u2019 is thus obtained which may be used for grouping."
