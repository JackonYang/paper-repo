paperAbstract: "One fifth (4 of 20) of the research articles published in the Journal\
  \ of Educational Statistics in 1988 include simulation studies that justify or illustrate\
  \ the authors' conclusions. A similar fraction (6 of 33) of the articles in the\
  \ 1988 volume of Psychometrika include simulations; comparable proportions could\
  \ be expected in other journals at the boundary of theoretical statistics and social/psychological\
  \ applications. Due in part to the complexity of the problems tackled today and\
  \ in part to the availability of cheap, powerful computing\u2014by no means independent\
  \ influences\u2014simulation and Monte Carlo methods have become both necessary\
  \ and practical tools for statisticians and applied workers in quantitative areas\
  \ of education and psychology. Simulation has become popular\u2014not only in the\
  \ quantitative social sciences, but in all of the mathematical sciences from physics\
  \ to operations research to number theory\u2014because it is almost always easy\
  \ to do. This ease of use makes the simulation experimenter vulnerable to two common\
  \ pitfalls. Selection of the basic source of \"random numbers\" is often passive:\
  \ Whatever is available in the computer's standard subroutine library is used. However,\
  \ the fact that a pseudo-random number generator appears in a popular software package\
  \ or operating system is hardly reason to trust it, as is shown by the infamous\
  \ RANDU generator, once popular on IBM mainframes and PDP mini-computers, and by\
  \ the generators burned into RAM on today's PCs. Simulation design and reporting\
  \ also deserve special care. Some attempt must be made to assess the accuracy of\
  \ the simulation estimates: One should accurately estimate and report SE (6) as\
  \ well as 6. In addition, enough detail should be reported that the interested reader\
  \ can replicate the study and check the results, just as with other experiments.\
  \ Yet these considerations are also easy to overlook. Brian D. Ripley's Stochastic\
  \ Simulation is a short, yet ambitious, survey of modern simulation techniques.\
  \ Three themes run throughout the book. First, one shoud not take basic simulation\
  \ subroutines for granted, especially on minior microcomputers where they tend to\
  \ be poor implementations, implementations of poor algorithms, or both. Second,\
  \ design of experiments, or variance reduction as it is known in this field, deserves\
  \ greater consideration. Third, modern methods make it possible to simulate and\
  \ analyze processes that are dependent over time, and using such processes opens\
  \ the door to new simulation techniques, such as simulated annealing in optimization.\
  \ Ripley intends this book to be a \"comprehensive guide,\" and it is indeed most\
  \ accurately described as a researcher's handbook with examples and"
