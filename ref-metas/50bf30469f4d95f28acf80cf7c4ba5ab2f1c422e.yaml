paperAbstract: ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical database of object classes.
  We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise segmentations, by leveraging
  existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The
  key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation
  of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which
  are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically
  most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation
  occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate
  the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly
  segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes
  that are already segmented. Through an experiment on 577 classes and 500k images
  we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations;
  (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently;
  (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut [1] initialized on the image center, as well
  as our recent segmentation transfer technique [2] on which this paper is based.
  Moreover, our method also delivers state-of-the-art results on the recent iCoseg
  dataset for co-segmentation.
