paperAbstract: Recognizing characters in a scene helps us obtain useful information.
  For the purpose, character recognition methods are required to recognize characters
  of various sizes, various rotation angles and complex layout on complex background.
  In this paper, we propose a character recognition method using local features having
  several desirable properties. The novelty of the proposed method is to take into
  account arrangement of local features so as to recognize multiple characters in
  an image unlike past methods. The effectiveness and possible improvement of the
  method are discussed.
