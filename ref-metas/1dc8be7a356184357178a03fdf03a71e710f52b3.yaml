paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a text detection and localization method.
  Our detection technique is based on a cascade of boosted ensemble and localizer
  uses standard image processing techniques. We propose a small set of features (39
  in total) capable of detecting various type of text in grey level natural scene
  images. Two weak learners, linear discriminant function and log likelihood-ratio
  test under gaussian assumption, are evaluated. Single features and combination of
  features are used to form weak classifiers. The proposed scheme is evaluated on
  ICDAR 2003 robust reading and text locating database. The results are encouraging
  and the detector can process an images of 640 times 480 pixels in less than 2 seconds.
