paperAbstract: 'Abstract The connection between the simplicity of scientific theories
  and the credence attributed to their predictions seems to permeate the practice
  of scientific discovery. When a scientist succeeds in explaining a set of nobservations
  using a model Mof complexity c then it is generally believed that the likelihood
  of finding another explanatory model with similar complexity but leading to opposite
  predictions decreases with increasing nand decreasing c. This paper derives formal
  relationships between n, c and the probability of ambiguous predictions by examining
  three modeling languages under binary classification tasks: perceptrons, Boolean
  formulae, and Boolean networks. Bounds are also derived for the probability of error
  associated with the policy of accepting only models of complexity not exceeding
  c. Human tendency to regard the simpler as the more trustworthy is given a qualified
  justification.'
