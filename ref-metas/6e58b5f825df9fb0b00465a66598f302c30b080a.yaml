paperAbstract: Ongoing efforts at adaptive statistical language modeling are described.
  To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the
  basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple
  triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based
  model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given
  consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and
  an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages
  of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its
  disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained
  on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints,
  200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints.
  After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower
  than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>
