paperAbstract: An algorithm for matching images of real world scenes is presented.
  The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images
  and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the
  scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image.
  These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be
  detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two
  sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity
  of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability
  of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding
  the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique
  making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of
  the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular
  parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates
  of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene.
