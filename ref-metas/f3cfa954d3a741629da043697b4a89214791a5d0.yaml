paperAbstract: I m p 1 e m e n t a t i o n development process. In basic physics,
  there are two primitives, force and mass. Force acts on mass and mass is changed
  by the force. In software development, the analogy to mass is objects and the analogy
  to force is operations, or algorithms. The term "object-oriented" means various
  things to different groups of software developers. To some it may imply the use
  of a particular object-oriented programming language, like Smalltalk, Actor, or
  C++. To others it could mean the step before system implementation, or coding, in
  the software development process, an object-oriented approach to design. Object-oriented
  purists may view this book as one on object-based programming, using object-oriented
  analysis and design with implementation in Ada 95. In any case, whether we call
  it objectoriented or object-based, the approach transcends the specifics in any
  particular programming language. During the analysis phase, solution details are
  not important; the overriding concern is understanding the problem. An object-based
  approach to analysis
