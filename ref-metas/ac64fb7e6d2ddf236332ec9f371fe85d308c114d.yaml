paperAbstract: We propose a method for automatically answering questions about images
  by bringing together recent advances from natural language processing and computer
  vision. We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a multi-world
  approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a bayesian framework.
  Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about realistic scenes
  and replies with range of answer like counts, object classes, instances and lists
  of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish
  a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual
  turing test.
