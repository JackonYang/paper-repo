paperAbstract: Often, the training procedure for statistical machine translation models
  is based on maximum likelihood or related criteria. A general problem of this approach
  is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen
  text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize
  translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic
  evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed
  error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if
  the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training
  procedure.
