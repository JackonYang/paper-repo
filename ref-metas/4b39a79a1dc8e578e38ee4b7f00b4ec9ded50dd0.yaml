paperAbstract: 'In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved
  great success in many computer vision tasks. Partially inspired by neuroscience,
  CNN shares many properties with the visual system of the brain. A prominent difference
  is that CNN is typically a feed-forward architecture while in the visual system
  recurrent connections are abundant. Inspired by this fact, we propose a recurrent
  CNN (RCNN) for object recognition by incorporating recurrent connections into each
  convolutional layer. Though the input is static, the activities of RCNN units evolve
  over time so that the activity of each unit is modulated by the activities of its
  neighboring units. This property enhances the ability of the model to integrate
  the context information, which is important for object recognition. Like other recurrent
  neural networks, unfolding the RCNN through time can result in an arbitrarily deep
  network with a fixed number of parameters. Furthermore, the unfolded network has
  multiple paths, which can facilitate the learning process. The model is tested on
  four benchmark object recognition datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and SVHN.
  With fewer trainable parameters, RCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on
  all of these datasets. Increasing the number of parameters leads to even better
  performance. These results demonstrate the advantage of the recurrent structure
  over purely feed-forward structure for object recognition.'
