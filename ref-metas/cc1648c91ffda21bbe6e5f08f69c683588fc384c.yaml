paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning approach for mapping
  natural language instructions to sequences of executable actions. We assume access
  to a reward function that defines the quality of the executed actions. During training,
  the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of documents, executes
  those actions, and observes the resulting reward. We use a policy gradient algorithm
  to estimate the parameters of a log-linear model for action selection. We apply
  our method to interpret instructions in two domains --- Windows troubleshooting
  guides and game tutorials. Our results demonstrate that this method can rival supervised
  learning techniques while requiring few or no annotated training examples.
