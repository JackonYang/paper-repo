paperAbstract: Methods based on local, viewpoint invariant features have proven capable
  of recognizing objects in spite of viewpoint changes, occlusion and clutter. However,
  these approaches fail when these factors are too strong, due to the limited repeatability
  and discriminative power of the features. As additional shortcomings, the objects
  need to be rigid and only their approximate location is found. We present a novel
  Object Recognition approach which overcomes these limitations. An initial set of
  feature correspondences is first generated. The method anchors on it and then gradually
  explores the surrounding area, trying to construct more and more matching features,
  increasingly farther from the initial ones. The resulting process covers the object
  with matches, and simultaneously separates the correct matches from the wrong ones.
  Hence, recognition and segmentation are achieved at the same time. Only very few
  correct initial matches suffice for reliable recognition. The experimental results
  demonstrate the stronger power of the presented method in dealing with extensive
  clutter, dominant occlusion, large scale and viewpoint changes. Moreover non-rigid
  deformations are explicitly taken into account, and the approximative contours of
  the object are produced. The approach can extend any viewpoint invariant feature
  extractor.
