paperAbstract: In this paper, we propose a method based on the Laplacian in the frequency
  domain for video text detection. Unlike many other approaches which assume that
  text is horizontally-oriented, our method is able to handle text of arbitrary orientation.
  The input image is first filtered with Fourier-Laplacian. K-means clustering is
  then used to identify candidate text regions based on the maximum difference. The
  skeleton of each connected component helps to separate the different text strings
  from each other. Finally, text string straightness and edge density are used for
  false positive elimination. Experimental results show that the proposed method is
  able to handle graphics text and scene text of both horizontal and nonhorizontal
  orientation.
