paperAbstract: 'An Algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem.
  The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks
  of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one
  octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions
  that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes
  place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two
  images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing
  small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved,
  it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that
  this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical
  and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions
  are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions.
  The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity
  is necessary for the fusion process.'
