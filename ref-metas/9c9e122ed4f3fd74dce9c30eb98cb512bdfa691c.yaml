paperAbstract: This chapter reviews techniques on text localization and recognition
  in scene images captured by camera. Since properties of scene texts are very different
  from scanned documents in various aspects, specific techniques are necessary to
  localize and recognize them. In fact, localization of scene text is a difficult
  and important task because there is no prior information on the location, layout,
  direction, size, typeface, and color of texts in a scene image in general and there
  are many textures and patterns similar to characters. In addition, recognition of
  scene text is also a difficult task because there are many characters distorted
  by blurring, perspective, nonuniform lighting, and low resolution. Decoration of
  characters makes the recognition task far more difficult. As reviewed in this chapter,
  those difficult tasks have been tackled with not only modified versions of conventional
  OCR techniques but also state-of-the-art computer vision and pattern recognition
  methodologies.
