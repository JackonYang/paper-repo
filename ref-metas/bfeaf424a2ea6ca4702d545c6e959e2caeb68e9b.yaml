paperAbstract: Bilateral filtering smooths images while preserving edges, by means
  of a nonlinear combination of nearby image values. The method is noniterative, local,
  and simple. It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness
  and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both
  domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a
  color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying
  the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned
  to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering
  produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors
  where they appear in the original image.
