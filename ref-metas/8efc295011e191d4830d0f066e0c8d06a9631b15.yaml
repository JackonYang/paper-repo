paperAbstract: This paper describes features and methods for document image comparison
  and classification at the spatial layout level. The methods are useful for visual
  similarity based document retrieval as well as fast algorithms for initial document
  type classification without OCR. A novel feature set called interval encoding is
  introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region
  layout information in fixed-length vectors by capturing structural characteristics
  of the image. These fixed-length vectors are then compared to each other through
  a Manhattan distance computation for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes
  experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their
  layout similarity to a test document. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the
  features derived from interval coding in a hidden Markov model based page layout
  classification system that is trainable and extendible. The methods described in
  the paper can be used in various document retrieval tasks including visual similarity
  based retrieval, categorization and information extraction.
