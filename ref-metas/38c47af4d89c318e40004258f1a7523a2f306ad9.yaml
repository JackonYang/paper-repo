paperAbstract: "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety\
  \ of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti\
  \ cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides\
  \ a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of\
  \ these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without\
  \ cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood,\
  \ and can be solved e\xC6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable\
  \ manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable\
  \ challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development\
  \ and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with\
  \ cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation,\
  \ as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest\
  \ (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make\
  \ use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the\
  \ associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate\
  \ the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the\
  \ utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within\
  \ the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include\
  \ the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian\
  \ processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded\
  \ spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate\
  \ estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical\
  \ results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations\
  \ of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the\
  \ notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate\
  \ inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points\
  \ and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on\
  \ the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the\
  \ exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions,\
  \ the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free\
  \ energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S. Willsky and Tommi S. Jaakkola Title: Professors\
