paperAbstract: 'Neural networks are a powerful technology forclassification of visual
  inputs arising from documents.However, there is a confusing plethora of different
  neuralnetwork methods that are used in the literature and inindustry. This paper
  describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can
  use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting
  a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform
  of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural
  networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks.
  Wepropose that a simple "do-it-yourself" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible
  architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional
  neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay,
  structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning
  the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which
  can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims
  on the MNIST set of English digitimages.'
