paperAbstract: "Recent research into recognizing object classes (such as humans, cows\
  \ and hands) has made use of edge features to hypothesize and localize class instances.\
  \ However, for the most part, these edge-based methods operate solely on the geometric\
  \ shape of edges, treating them equally and ignoring the fact that for certain object\
  \ classes, the appearance of the object on the \u201Cinside\u201D of the edge may\
  \ provide valuable recognition cues. \n \nWe show how, for such object classes,\
  \ small regions around edges can be used to classify the edge into object or non-object.\
  \ This classifier may then be used to prune edges which are not relevant to the\
  \ object class, and thereby improve the performance of subsequent processing. We\
  \ demonstrate learning class specific edges for a number of object classes \u2014\
  \ oranges, bananas and bottles \u2014 under challenging scale and illumination variation.\
  \ \n \nBecause class-specific edge classification provides a low-level analysis\
  \ of the image it may be integrated into any edge-based recognition strategy without\
  \ significant change in the high-level algorithms. We illustrate its application\
  \ to two algorithms: (i) chamfer matching for object detection, and (ii) modulating\
  \ contrast terms in MRF based object-specific segmentation. We show that performance\
  \ of both algorithms (matching and segmentation) is considerably improved by the\
  \ class-specific edge labelling."
