paperAbstract: We present an analytic solution to the problem of estimating multiple
  2-D and 3-D motion models from two-view correspondences or optical flow. The key
  to our approach is to view the estimation of multiple motion models as the estimation
  of a single multibody motion model. This is possible thanks to two important algebraic
  facts. First, we show that all the image measurements, regardless of their associated
  motion model, can be fit with a real or complex polynomial. Second, we show that
  the parameters of the motion model associated with an image measurement can be obtained
  from the derivatives of the polynomial at the measurement. This leads to a novel
  motion segmentation algorithm that applies to most of the two-view motion models
  adopted in computer vision. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
  existing algebraic methods in terms of efficiency and robustness, and provides a
  good initialization for iterative techniques, such as EM, which is strongly dependent
  on correct initialization.
