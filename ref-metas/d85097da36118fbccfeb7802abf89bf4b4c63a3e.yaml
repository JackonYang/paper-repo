paperAbstract: 'Page layout analysis is a document processing technique used to determine
  the format of a page. This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum),
  which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor
  clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line,
  and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous
  over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence
  from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different
  text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several
  different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate
  the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and
  disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >'
