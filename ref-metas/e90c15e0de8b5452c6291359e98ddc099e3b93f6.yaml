paperAbstract: In this paper we extend previous work on isolated-word recognition
  based on hidden Markov models by replacing the discrete symbol representation of
  the speech signal with a continuous Gaussian mixture density. In this manner the
  inherent quantization error introduced by the discrete representation is essentially
  eliminated. The resulting recognizer was tested on a vocabulary of the ten digits
  across a wide range of talkers and test conditions and shown to have an error rate
  comparable to that of the best template recognizers and significantly lower than
  that of the discrete symbol hidden Markov model system. We discuss several issues
  involved in the training of the continuous density models and in the implementation
  of the recognizer.
