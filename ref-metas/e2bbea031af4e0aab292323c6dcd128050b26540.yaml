paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nEngineers must make decisions regarding the\
  \ distribution of expensive resources in a manner that will be economically beneficial.\
  \ This problem can be realistically formulated and logically analyzed with optimization\
  \ theory. This book shows engineers how to use optimization theory to solve complex\
  \ problems. Unifies the large field of optimization with a few geometric principles.\
  \ Covers functional analysis with a minimum of mathematics. Contains problems that\
  \ relate to the applications in the book."
