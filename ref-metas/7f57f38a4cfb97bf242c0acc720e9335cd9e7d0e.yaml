paperAbstract: Inspired by the success of MRF models for solving object segmentation
  problems, we formulate the binarization problem in this framework. We represent
  the pixels in a document image as random variables in an MRF, and introduce a new
  energy (or cost) function on these variables. Each variable takes a foreground or
  background label, and the quality of the binarization (or labelling) is determined
  by the value of the energy function. We minimize the energy function, i.e. find
  the optimal binarization, using an iterative graph cut scheme. Our model is robust
  to variations in foreground and background colours as we use a Gaussian Mixture
  Model in the energy function. In addition, our algorithm is efficient to compute,
  and adapts to a variety of document images. We show results on word images from
  the challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset, and compare our performance with previously
  reported methods. Our approach shows significant improvement in pixel level accuracy
  as well as OCR accuracy.
