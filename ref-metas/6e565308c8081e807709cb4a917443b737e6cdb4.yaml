paperAbstract: Training large-scale question answering systems is complicated because
  training sources usually cover a small portion of the range of possible questions.
  This paper studies the impact of multitask and transfer learning for simple question
  answering; a setting for which the reasoning required to answer is quite easy, as
  long as one can retrieve the correct evidence given a question, which can be difficult
  in large-scale conditions. To this end, we introduce a new dataset of 100k questions
  that we use in conjunction with existing benchmarks. We conduct our study within
  the framework of Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015) because this perspective
  allows us to eventually scale up to more complex reasoning, and show that Memory
  Networks can be successfully trained to achieve excellent performance.
