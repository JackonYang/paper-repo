paperAbstract: "Figure/ground assignment is a key step in perceptual organization\
  \ which assigns contours to one of the two abutting regions, providing information\
  \ about occlusion and allowing high-level processing to focus on non-accidental\
  \ shapes of figural regions. In this paper, we develop a computational model for\
  \ figure/ground assignment in complex natural scenes. We utilize a large dataset\
  \ of images annotated with human-marked segmentations and figure/ground labels for\
  \ training and quantitative evaluation. \n \nWe operationalize the concept of familiar\
  \ configuration by constructing prototypical local shapes, i.e. shapemes, from image\
  \ data. Shapemes automatically encode mid-level visual cues to figure/ground assignment\
  \ such as convexity and parallelism. Based on the shapeme representation, we train\
  \ a logistic classifier to locally predict figure/ground labels. We also consider\
  \ a global model using a conditional random field (CRF) to enforce global figure/ground\
  \ consistency at T-junctions. We use loopy belief propagation to perform approximate\
  \ inference on this model and learn maximum likelihood parameters from ground-truth\
  \ labels. \n \nWe find that the local shapeme model achieves an accuracy of 64%\
  \ in predicting the correct figural assignment. This compares favorably to previous\
  \ studies using classical figure/ground cues [1]. We evaluate the global model using\
  \ either a set of contours extracted from a low-level edge detector or the set of\
  \ contours given by human segmentations. The global CRF model significantly improves\
  \ the performance over the local model, most notably when using human-marked boundaries\
  \ (78%). These promising experimental results show that this is a feasible approach\
  \ to bottom-up figure/ground assignment in natural images."
