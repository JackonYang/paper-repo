paperAbstract: "We present a novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use\
  \ in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. In total, we recorded 6 hours\
  \ of traffic scenarios at 10\u2013100 Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such\
  \ as high-resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner\
  \ and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system. The scenarios are diverse,\
  \ capturing real-world traffic situations, and range from freeways over rural areas\
  \ to inner-city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is calibrated,\
  \ synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences.\
  \ Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide\
  \ online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks.\
  \ This paper describes our recording platform, the data format and the utilities\
  \ that we provide."
