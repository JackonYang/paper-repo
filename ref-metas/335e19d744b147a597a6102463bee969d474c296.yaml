paperAbstract: This paper defines a computational protocol for evaluating the performance
  of raster to vector conversion systems. The graphical entities handled by this protocol
  are continuous and dashed lines, arcs, and circles, and text regions. The protocol
  allows matches of the type one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one between the
  ground truth and the recognition results.
