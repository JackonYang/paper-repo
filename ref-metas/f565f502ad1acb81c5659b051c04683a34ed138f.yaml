paperAbstract: 'Automatic text location (without character recognition capabilities)
  deals with extracting image regions that contain text only. The images of these
  regions can then be fed to an optical character recognition module or highlighted
  for users. This is very useful in a number of applications such as database indexing
  and converting paper documents to their electronic versions. The performance of
  our automatic text location algorithm is shown in several applications. Compared
  with some traditional text location methods, our method has the following advantages:
  1) low computational cost; 2) robust to font size; and 3) high accuracy.'
