paperAbstract: We propose an objective, comprehensive and difficulty-independent performance
  evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a
  positive set and a negative set of indices at textbox level, which evaluate the
  detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected
  textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each
  ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect
  to the textbox DD level and are therefore independent of the ground truth difficulty.
  We also assign a detection importance (DI) level to each ground truth textbox. The
  overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of
  all ground truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal
  the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied
  on a text detection approach to determine the best parameters that can yield the
  best detection results.
