paperAbstract: This paper demonstrates a content-based retrieval strategy that can
  tell whether there are naked people present in an image. No manual intervention
  is required. The approach combines color and texture properties to obtain an effective
  mask for skin regions. The skin mask is shown to be effective for a wide range of
  shades and colors of skin. These skin regions are then fed to a specialized grouper,
  which attempts to group a human figure using geometric constraints on human structure.
  This approach introduces a new view of object recognition, where an object model
  is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints
  on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts, and the relationships
  between parts, and constraints on color and texture. The system is demonstrated
  to have 60% precision and 52% recall on a test set of 138 uncontrolled images of
  naked people, mostly obtained from the internet, and 1401 assorted control images,
  drawn from a wide collection of sources.
