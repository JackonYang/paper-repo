paperAbstract: 'In general, frame theories are theories about the representation and
  use of knowledge for pattern recognition. In the present article, the general properties
  of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological
  processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields
  viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures
  of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures,
  each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were
  then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the
  targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target
  pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been
  changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames
  may function as "semantic pattern detectors," so that the perceptual knowledge in
  them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension.
  Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding
  procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification
  of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame)
  should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses
  were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected
  objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects.
  On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been
  made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct
  rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated.
  These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects
  represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally
  encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were
  deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two
  events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long
  as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus,
  for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically "tagged"
  is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same
  general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception
  and memory.'
