paperAbstract: A method for modelling time series is presented and then applied to
  the analysis of the speech signal. A time series is represented as a sample sequence
  generated by a finite state hidden Markov model with output densities parameterized
  by linear prediction polynomials and error variances. These objects are defined
  and their properties developed. The theory culminates in a theorem that provides
  a computationally efficient iterative scheme to improve the model. The theorem has
  been used to create models from speech signals of considerable length. One such
  model is examined with emphasis on the relationship between states of the model
  and traditional classes of speech events. A use of the method is illustrated by
  an application to the talker verification problem.
