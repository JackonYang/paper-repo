paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a unified framework for object detection, segmentation,
  and classification using regions. Region features are appealing in this context
  because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they
  are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as
  features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start
  by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al.,
  CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color
  and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection
  and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses
  of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and
  a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly
  outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection
  rate compared to Ferrari et al. ''s 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance
  on the Caltech 101 database.'
