paperAbstract: "High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by\
  \ training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct\
  \ high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the\
  \ weights in such \u201Cautoencoder\u201D networks, but this works well only if\
  \ the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way\
  \ of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional\
  \ codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce\
  \ the dimensionality of data."
