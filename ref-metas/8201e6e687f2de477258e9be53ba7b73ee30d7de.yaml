paperAbstract: "Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem\
  \ of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is\
  \ clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant\
  \ user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully\
  \ automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace\
  \ the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task\
  \ and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors\
  \ in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test\
  \ time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm\
  \ using a \u201Ccolorization Turing test,\u201D asking human participants to choose\
  \ between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools\
  \ humans on 32 % of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover,\
  \ we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature\
  \ learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art\
  \ performance on several feature learning benchmarks."
