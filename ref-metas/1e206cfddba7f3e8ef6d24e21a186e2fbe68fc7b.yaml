paperAbstract: "The classification of cat retinal ganglion cells as X or Y on the\
  \ basis of linearity or nonlinearity of spatial summation has been confirmed and\
  \ extended. Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed\
  \ cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X\
  \ cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating.\
  \ 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency\
  \ of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the\
  \ particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on\u2010off' response, or frequency doubling,\
  \ at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast\
  \ sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types.\
  \ With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence\
  \ on spatial phase, while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner\
  \ on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components\
  \ of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second\
  \ harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was\
  \ spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7.\
  \ The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity.\
  \ X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index\
  \ always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were\
  \ compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells. The nonlinearity\
  \ index was most reliable because it was least dependent on retinal eccentricity."
