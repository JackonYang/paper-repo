paperAbstract: 'Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have shown excellent results
  on many visual classification tasks. With the exception of ImageNet, these datasets
  are carefully crafted such that objects are well-aligned at similar scales. Naturally,
  the feature learning problem gets more challenging as the amount of variation in
  the data increases, as the models have to learn to be invariant to certain changes
  in appearance. Recent results on the ImageNet dataset show that given enough data,
  ConvNets can learn such invariances producing very discriminative features [1].
  But could we do more: use less parameters, less data, learn more discriminative
  features, if certain invariances were built into the learning process? In this paper
  we present a simple model that allows ConvNets to learn features in a locally scale-invariant
  manner without increasing the number of model parameters. We show on a modified
  MNIST dataset that when faced with scale variation, building in scale-invariance
  allows ConvNets to learn more discriminative features with reduced chances of over-fitting.'
