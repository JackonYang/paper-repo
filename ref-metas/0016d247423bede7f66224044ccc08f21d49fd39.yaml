paperAbstract: Most state-of-the-art text detection methods are specific to horizontal
  Latin text and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment
  Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose
  text into two locally detectable elements, namely segments and links. A segment
  is an oriented box covering a part of a word or text line, A link connects two adjacent
  segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements
  are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional
  neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by
  links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of
  accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75.0% on the
  standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous
  best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512x512 images. Moreover, without
  modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese.
