paperAbstract: 'Abstract : Yamabico-11 is an autonomous mobile robot used as a research
  platform with one area in image understanding. Previous work focused on edge detection
  analysis on a Silicon Graphics Iris (SGI) workstation with no method for implementation
  on the robot. Yamabico-11 does not have an on-board image processing capability
  to detect straight edges in a grayscale image and a method for allowing the user
  to analyze the data. The approach taken for system development is partly based on
  edge extraction and line fitting algorithms of (PET92) with a 3-D geometric model
  of the robot''s world (STE92). Image grabbing routines of (KIS95) were used to capture
  images with the robot''s digital output camera and processed using image understanding
  routines developed for a SGI workstation. The routines were modified and ported
  onto the robot. The new method of edge extraction produces less ambient noise and
  more continuous vertical line segments in the gradient image which enhances pattern
  matching analysis of the image. Yamabico-11''s computer system can capture an image
  with a resolution of 739 x 484 active picture elements. Edge detection analysis
  is performed on the robot which generates a list structure of edges and stored in
  the robot''s memory for user analysis.'
