paperAbstract: This paper plans an end-to-end method for extracting information from
  tables embedded in documents; input format is ASCII, to which any richer format
  can be converted, preserving all textual and much of the layout information. We
  start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information
  from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different
  authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still
  unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms
  and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed
  to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between
  different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can
  reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems.
  Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring
  the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually
  improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider
  context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be
  made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability
  in different contexts.
