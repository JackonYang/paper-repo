paperAbstract: Tliere are a number of important phenom- ena in motion perception involving
  colicrcnce. Examples include motion capture and motion cooperativity. We propose
  a theoretical model, called the motion coherence tlieory, that gives a possible
  explanation for these effects (Yuille and Grzywacz, 1988a,b). In this framework,
  the aperture problem can also be thought of as a problem of coherence and given
  a similar explanation. We propose the concept of a velocity field dcfined everywhere
  in the image, even where there is no explicit motion information available. Through
  a cost function, tlie model imposes smoothness on the velocity field in a more general
  way than previous theories. In this paper, we provide a de- tailed theoretical analysis
  of the motion coherence theory. We discuss its relations with previous theories
  and show that some of t1ic.m arc approximations to it. A sccorid pa- per (Grzywacz,
  Smith, and Yuillc, 1088) provides exten- sions and cletnilcd comparisons to psychophysical
  plienom- cna. Tlic theory applies to both short-range and long- range motion. It
  places them in the same computational framework aiid provides a way to define interactions
  be- twcr:11 the two 1)roccsses.
