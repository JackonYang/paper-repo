paperAbstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has led to successes in many applications
  of machine learning, from natural language processing and speech recognition to
  computer vision and drug discovery. This article aims to give a general overview
  of MTL, particularly in deep neural networks. It introduces the two most common
  methods for MTL in Deep Learning, gives an overview of the literature, and discusses
  recent advances. In particular, it seeks to help ML practitioners apply MTL by shedding
  light on how MTL works and providing guidelines for choosing appropriate auxiliary
  tasks.
