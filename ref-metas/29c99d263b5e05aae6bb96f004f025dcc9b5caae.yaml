paperAbstract: Information extraction IE is the problem of lling out pre de ned structured
  sum maries from text documents We are in terested in performing IE in non traditional
  domains where much of the text is often ungrammatical such as electronic bulletin
  board posts and Web pages We suggest that the best approach is one that takes into
  ac count many di erent kinds of information and argue for the suitability of a multistrat
  egy approach We describe learners for IE drawn from three separate machine learning
  paradigms rote memorization term space text classi cation and relational rule induc
  tion By building regression models mapping from learner con dence to probability
  of cor rectness and combining probabilities appro priately it is possible to improve
  extraction accuracy over that achieved by any individ ual learner We describe three
  di erent mul tistrategy approaches Experiments on two IE domains a collection of
  electronic seminar announcements from a university computer science department and
  a set of newswire ar ticles describing corporate acquisitions from the Reuters collection
  demonstrate the e ec tiveness of all three approaches
