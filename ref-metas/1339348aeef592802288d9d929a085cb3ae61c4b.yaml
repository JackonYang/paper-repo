paperAbstract: This paper describes error-correction adjustment procedures for determining
  the weight vector of linear pattern classifiers under general pattern distribution.
  It is mainly aimed at clarifying theoretically the performance of adaptive pattern
  classifiers. In the case where the loss depends on the distance between a pattern
  vector and a decision boundary and where the average risk function is unimodal,
  it is proved that, by the procedures proposed here, the weight vector converges
  to the optimal one even under nonseparable pattern distributions. The speed and
  the accuracy of convergence are analyzed, and it is shown that there is an important
  tradeoff between speed and accuracy of convergence. Dynamical behaviors, when the
  probability distributions of patterns are changing, are also shown. The theory is
  generalized and made applicable to the case with general discriminant functions,
  including piecewise-linear discriminant functions.
