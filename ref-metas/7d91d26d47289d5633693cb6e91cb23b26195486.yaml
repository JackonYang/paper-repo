paperAbstract: We address the problem of estimating the position and motion of a human
  arm in 3D without any constraints on its behavior and without the use of special
  markers. We model the arm as two truncated right-circular cones connected with spherical
  joints. We propose to use a recursive estimator for arm position, and to provide
  the estimator with error signals obtained by comparing the projected estimated arm
  position with that of the actual arm in the image. The system is demonstrated and
  tested on a real image sequence.<<ETX>>
