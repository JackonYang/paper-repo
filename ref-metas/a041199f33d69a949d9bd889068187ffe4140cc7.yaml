paperAbstract: The authors describe a technique for building compact models of the
  shape and appearance of flexible objects seen in 2-D images. The models are derived
  from the statistics of sets of labeled images of example objects. Each model consists
  of a flexible shape template, describing how important points of the object can
  vary, and a statistical model of the expected grey levels in regions around each
  model point. Such models have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. A
  description is given on how the models can be used in local image search, and examples
  of their application are included.<<ETX>>
