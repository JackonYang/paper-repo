paperAbstract: It is shown that neural networks for speech recognition can be constructed
  in a modular fashion by exploiting the hidden structure of previously trained phonetic
  subcategory networks. The performance of resulting larger phonetic nets was found
  to be as good as the performance of the subcomponent nets by themselves. This approach
  avoids the excessive learning times that would be necessary to train larger networks
  and allows for incremental learning. Large time-delay neural networks constructed
  incrementally by applying these modular training techniques achieved a recognition
  performance of 96.0% for all consonants and 94.7% for all phonemes.<<ETX>>
