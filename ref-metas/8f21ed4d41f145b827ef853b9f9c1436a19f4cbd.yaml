paperAbstract: The goal of this work is to accurately detect and localize boundaries
  in natural scenes using local image measurements. We formulate features that respond
  to characteristic changes in brightness and texture associated with natural boundaries.
  In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, a classifier
  is trained using human labeled images as ground truth. We present precision-recall
  curves showing that the resulting detector outperforms existing approaches.
