paperAbstract: Abstract Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest
  in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from
  using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition,
  video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that
  of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance
  achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review
  progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking
  machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they
  learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1)
  build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather
  than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive
  theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned;
  and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize
  knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising
  routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network
  advances with more structured cognitive models.
