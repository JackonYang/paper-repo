paperAbstract: In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for image and video texture
  synthesis. In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed
  and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate
  a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of
  the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine
  the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture.
  Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable
  in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture
  synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset
  search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization.
  We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos.
  We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different
  images to generate new scenes.
