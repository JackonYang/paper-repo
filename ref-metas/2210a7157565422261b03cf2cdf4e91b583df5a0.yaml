paperAbstract: The authors introduce an algorithm, called matching pursuit, that decomposes
  any signal into a linear expansion of waveforms that are selected from a redundant
  dictionary of functions. These waveforms are chosen in order to best match the signal
  structures. Matching pursuits are general procedures to compute adaptive signal
  representations. With a dictionary of Gabor functions a matching pursuit defines
  an adaptive time-frequency transform. They derive a signal energy distribution in
  the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference terms, unlike Wigner
  and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit isolates the signal structures
  that are coherent with respect to a given dictionary. An application to pattern
  extraction from noisy signals is described. They compare a matching pursuit decomposition
  with a signal expansion over an optimized wavepacket orthonormal basis, selected
  with the algorithm of Coifman and Wickerhauser see (IEEE Trans. Informat. Theory,
  vol. 38, Mar. 1992). >
