paperAbstract: This paper focuses on a comparative evaluation of a wide-range of text
  categorization methods, including previously published results on the Reuters corpus
  and new results of additional experiments. A controlled study using three classifiers,
  kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations
  in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis
  and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters
  were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents,
  mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions
  in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters
  which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared
  directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used
  as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude
  the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network
  method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning
  algorithms also performed relatively well.
