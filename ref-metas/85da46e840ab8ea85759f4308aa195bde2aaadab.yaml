paperAbstract: This paper relates different kinds of language modeling methods that
  can be applied to the linguistic decoding part of a speech recognition system with
  a very large vocabulary. These models are studied experimentally on a pseudophonetic
  input arising from French stenotypy. We propose a model which combines the advantages
  of a statistical modeling with information theoretic tools, and those of a grammatical
  approach.
