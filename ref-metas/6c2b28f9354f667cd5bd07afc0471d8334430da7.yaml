paperAbstract: 'A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability
  function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because
  of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested
  is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional
  but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating
  very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the
  curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which
  allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of
  semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed
  representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences,
  expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because
  a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it
  is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation)
  to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions
  of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report
  on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two
  text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art
  n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer
  contexts.'
