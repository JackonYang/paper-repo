paperAbstract: In this paper a theory of two-dimensional moment invariants for planar
  geometric figures is presented. A fundamental theorem is established to relate such
  moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment
  invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived.
  Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are
  also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern
  recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation
  program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition
  of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size
  and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is
  possible to include invariance with parallel projection.
