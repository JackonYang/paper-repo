paperAbstract: "In the square linear blind source separation problem, one must find\
  \ a linear unmixing operator which can detangle the result xi(t) of mixing n unknown\
  \ independent sources si(t) through an unknown n \xD7 n mixing matrix A(t) of causal\
  \ linear filters: xi = \u03A3j aij * sj. We cast the problem as one of maximum likelihood\
  \ density estimation, and in that framework introduce an algorithm that searches\
  \ for independent components using both temporal and spatial cues. We call the resulting\
  \ algorithm \"Contextual ICA,\" after the (Bell and Sejnowski 1995) Infomax algorithm,\
  \ which we show to be a special case of cICA. Because cICA can make use of the temporal\
  \ structure of its input, it is able separate in a number of situations where standard\
  \ methods cannot, including sources with low kurtosis, colored Gaussian sources,\
  \ and sources which have Gaussian histograms."
