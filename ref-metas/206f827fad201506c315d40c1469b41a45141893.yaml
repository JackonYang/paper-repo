paperAbstract: 'A low-density parity-check code is a code specified by a parity-check
  matrix with the following properties: each column contains a small fixed number
  j \geq 3 of l''s and each row contains a small fixed number k > j of l''s. The typical
  minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed
  rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently
  quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error
  decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple
  but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori
  probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling
  capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with
  block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using
  this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially
  with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual
  probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound.'
