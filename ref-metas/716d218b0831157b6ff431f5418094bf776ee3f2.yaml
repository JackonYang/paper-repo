paperAbstract: This book is the outcome of two workshops that brought together about
  40 prominent vision and machine learning researchers interested in the fundamental
  and applicative aspects of object recognition, as well as representatives of industry.
  The main goals of these two workshops were (1) to promote the creation of an international
  object recognition community, with common datasets and evaluation procedures, (2)
  to map the state of the art and identify the main open problems and opportunities
  for synergistic research, and (3) to articulate the industrial and societal needs
  and opportunities for object recognition research worldwide. These goals are reflected
  in a relatively small number of papers that illustrate the breadth of today's object
  recognition research and the arsenal of techniques at its disposal, and discuss
  current achievements and outstanding challenges. Most of the chapters are descriptions
  of technical approaches, intended to capture the current state of the art. Some
  of the chapters are of a tutorial nature. They cover fundamental building blocks
  for object recognition techniques.
