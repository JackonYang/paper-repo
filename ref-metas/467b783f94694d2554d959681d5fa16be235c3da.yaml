paperAbstract: 'Cursive script word recognition is the problem of transforming a word
  from the iconic form of cursive writing to its symbolic form. Several component
  processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are
  described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels:
  points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation
  is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters
  and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm
  and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level
  processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference
  line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower
  contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours
  and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented
  events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described.
