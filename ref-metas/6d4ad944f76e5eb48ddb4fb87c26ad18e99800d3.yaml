paperAbstract: "Abstract A novel method of representing multivariate data is presented.\
  \ Each point in k-dimensional space, k\u226418, is represented by a cartoon of a\
  \ face whose features, such as length of nose and curvature of mouth, correspond\
  \ to components of the point. Thus every multivariate observation is visualized\
  \ as a computer-drawn face. This presentation makes it easy for the human mind to\
  \ grasp many of the essential regularities and irregularities present in the data.\
  \ Other graphical representations are described briefly."
