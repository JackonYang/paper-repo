paperAbstract: We introduce a text-based image feature and demonstrate that it consistently
  improves performance on hard object classification problems. The feature is built
  using an auxiliary dataset of images annotated with tags, downloaded from the Internet.
  We do not inspect or correct the tags and expect that they are noisy. We obtain
  the text feature of an unannotated image from the tags of its k-nearest neighbors
  in this auxiliary collection. A visual classifier presented with an object viewed
  under novel circumstances (say, a new viewing direction) must rely on its visual
  examples. Our text feature may not change, because the auxiliary dataset likely
  contains a similar picture. While the tags associated with images are noisy, they
  are more stable when appearance changes. We test the performance of this feature
  using PASCAL VOC 2006 and 2007 datasets. Our feature performs well, consistently
  improves the performance of visual object classifiers, and is particularly effective
  when the training dataset is small.
