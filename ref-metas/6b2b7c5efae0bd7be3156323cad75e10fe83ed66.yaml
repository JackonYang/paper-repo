paperAbstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand
  a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including
  object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades
  have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently
  have researchers returned to the difficult task of considering them jointly. In
  this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve
  their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classification
  Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classifiers are coupled by
  their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level.
  Our method requires only a limited "black box" interface with the models, allowing
  us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classifiers without having to look
  under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of
  natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection,
  multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction.
