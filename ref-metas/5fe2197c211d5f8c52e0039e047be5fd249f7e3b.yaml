paperAbstract: This work deals with computer analysis of textured surfaces. Descriptions
  of textures are formalized from natural language descriptions. Local texture descriptions
  are obtained from the directional and non-directional components of the Fourier
  transform power spectrum. Analytic expressions are derived for orientation, contrast,
  size, spacing, and in periodic cases, the locations of texture elements. The local
  descriptions are defined over windows of varying sizes.
