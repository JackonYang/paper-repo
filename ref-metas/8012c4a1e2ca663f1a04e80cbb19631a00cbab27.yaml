paperAbstract: "THE receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex\
  \ can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented1\u20134 and bandpass\
  \ (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis\
  \ functions of wavelet transforms5,6. One approach to understanding such response\
  \ properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical\
  \ structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these\
  \ lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms\
  \ on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u2013\
  18, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and\
  \ contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12\
  \ that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for\
  \ these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse\
  \ linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented,\
  \ bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex.\
  \ The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later\
  \ stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence\
  \ among its outputs."
