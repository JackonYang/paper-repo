paperAbstract: 'Reasoning about objects, relations, and physics is central to human
  intelligence, and a key goal of artificial intelligence. Here we introduce the interaction
  network, a model which can reason about how objects in complex systems interact,
  supporting dynamical predictions, as well as inferences about the abstract properties
  of the system. Our model takes graphs as input, performs object- and relation-centric
  reasoning in a way that is analogous to a simulation, and is implemented using deep
  neural networks. We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical
  domains: n-body problems, rigid-body collision, and non-rigid dynamics. Our results
  show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens
  of objects over thousands of time steps, estimate abstract quantities such as energy,
  and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations
  of objects and relations. Our interaction network implementation is the first general-purpose,
  learnable physics engine, and a powerful general framework for reasoning about object
  and relations in a wide variety of complex real-world domains.'
