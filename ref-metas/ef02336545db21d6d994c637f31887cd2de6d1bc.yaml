paperAbstract: A framework for modeling and recognition of temporal activities is
  proposed. The modeling of sets of exemplar activities is achieved by parameterizing
  their representation in the form of principal components. Recognition of spatio-temporal
  variants of modeled activities is achieved by parameterizing the search in the space
  of admissible transformations that the activities can undergo. Experiments on recognition
  of articulated and deformable object motion from image motion parameters are presented.
