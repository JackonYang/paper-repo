paperAbstract: This paper introduces a discriminative model for the retrieval of images
  from text queries. Our approach formalizes the retrieval task as a ranking problem,
  and introduces a learning procedure optimizing a criterion related to the ranking
  performance. The proposed model hence addresses the retrieval problem directly and
  does not rely on an intermediate image annotation task, which contrasts with previous
  research. Moreover, our learning procedure builds upon recent work on the online
  learning of kernel-based classifiers. This yields an efficient, scalable algorithm,
  which can benefit from recent kernels developed for image comparison. The experiments
  performed over stock photography data show the advantage of our discriminative ranking
  approach over state-of-the-art alternatives (e.g. our model yields 26.3% average
  precision over the Corel dataset, which should be compared to 22.0%, for the best
  alternative model evaluated). Further analysis of the results shows that our model
  is especially advantageous over difficult queries such as queries with few relevant
  pictures or multiple-word queries.
