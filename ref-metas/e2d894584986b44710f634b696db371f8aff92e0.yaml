paperAbstract: 'A key challenge in designing convolutional network models is sizing
  them appropriately. Many factors are involved in these decisions, including number
  of layers, feature maps, kernel sizes, etc. Complicating this further is the fact
  that each of these influence not only the numbers and dimensions of the activation
  units, but also the total number of parameters. In this paper we focus on assessing
  the independent contributions of three of these linked variables: The numbers of
  layers, feature maps, and parameters. To accomplish this, we employ a recursive
  convolutional network whose weights are tied between layers; this allows us to vary
  each of the three factors in a controlled setting. We find that while increasing
  the numbers of layers and parameters each have clear benefit, the number of feature
  maps (and hence dimensionality of the representation) appears ancillary, and finds
  most of its benefit through the introduction of more weights. Our results (i) empirically
  confirm the notion that adding layers alone increases computational power, within
  the context of convolutional layers, and (ii) suggest that precise sizing of convolutional
  feature map dimensions is itself of little concern; more attention should be paid
  to the number of parameters in these layers instead.'
