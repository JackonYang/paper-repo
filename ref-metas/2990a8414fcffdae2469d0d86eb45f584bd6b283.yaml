paperAbstract: "Previous studies have reported that some neurons in the inferior temporal\
  \ (IT) cortex respond selectively to highly specific complex objects. In the present\
  \ study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons\
  \ to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such\
  \ as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of\
  \ these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying\
  \ the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually\
  \ every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective\
  \ along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity\
  \ was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do\
  \ not appear to be \u201Cdetectors\u201D for complex objects, we did find a separate\
  \ population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these\
  \ cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their\
  \ selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly\
  \ high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These\
  \ results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of\
  \ faces in IT cortex."
