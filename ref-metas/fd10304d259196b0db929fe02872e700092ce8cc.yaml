paperAbstract: A new method of locating partially visible two-dimensional objects
  has been designed. The method is applicable to complex industrial parts that may
  contain several occurrences of local features such as holes and corners. The matching
  process is robust, because it bases its decisions on groups of mutually consistent
  features, and it is relatively fast, because it concentrates on key features that
  are automatically selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of CAD type of models
  of the objects.
