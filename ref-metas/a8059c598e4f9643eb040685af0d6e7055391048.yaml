paperAbstract: Edge detection is the process that attempts to characterize the intensity
  changes in the image in terms of the physical processes that have originated them.
  A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization
  of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection
  problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different
  types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of
  edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical
  differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation
  needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation.
  This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step
  and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail
  the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different
  types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited
  support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational
  efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential
  operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the
  Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings
  of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical
  and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied
  in terms of transversality and Morse theory.
