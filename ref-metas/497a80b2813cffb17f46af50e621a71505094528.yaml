paperAbstract: We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that
  uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued "visible"
  variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each
  time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few
  time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efficient and allows us
  to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model finds
  a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of
  motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion
  sequences and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during motion capture.
