paperAbstract: In this paper we present a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful
  method for visual prediction which combines the effectiveness of mid-level visual
  elements with temporal modeling. Our framework can be learned in a completely unsupervised
  manner from a large collection of videos. However, more importantly, because our
  approach models the prediction framework on these mid-level elements, we can not
  only predict the possible motion in the scene but also predict visual appearances
  - how are appearances going to change with time. This yields a visual "hallucination"
  of probable events on top of the scene. We show that our method is able to accurately
  predict and visualize simple future events, we also show that our approach is comparable
  to supervised methods for event prediction.
