paperAbstract: The requirement of detection and identification of tables from document
  images is crucial to any document image analysis and digital library system. In
  this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables
  present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables
  have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially
  larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation
  has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation
  cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including
  formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation.
