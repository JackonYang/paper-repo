paperAbstract: The shape-space l. k m whose points a represent the shapes of not totally
  degenerate /c-ads in IR m is introduced as a quotient space carrying the quotient
  metric. When m = 1, we find that Y\ = S k ~ 2 ; when m ^ 3, the shape-space contains
  singularities. This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space
  I* ca n be identified with a version of CP*~ 2 . Of special importance are the shape-measures
  induced on CP k ~ 2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices.
  We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems
  associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape
  distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to
  testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of
  (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced
  Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant
  is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established.
