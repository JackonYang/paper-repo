paperAbstract: In this paper a new sequential decoding algorithm is introduced that
  uses stack storage at the receiver. It is much simpler to describe and analyze than
  the Fano algorithm, and is about six times faster than the latter at transmission
  rates equal to Rcomp the rate below which the average number of decoding steps is
  bounded by a constant. Practical problems connected with implementing the stack
  algorithm are discussed and a scheme is described that facilitates satisfactory
  performance even with limited stack storage capacity. Preliminary simulation results
  estimating the decoding effort and the needed stack siazree presented.
