paperAbstract: Until recently, artificial intelligence researchers have frowned upon
  the application of probability propagation in Bayesian belief networks that have
  cycles. The probability propagation algorithm is only exact in networks that are
  cycle-free. However, it has recently been discovered that the two best error-correcting
  decoding algorithms are actually performing probability propagation in belief networks
  with cycles.
