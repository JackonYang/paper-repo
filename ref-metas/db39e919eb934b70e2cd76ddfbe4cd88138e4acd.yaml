paperAbstract: Producing a database of scanned document images for development or
  evaluation of OCR and document image understanding algorithms is neither easy nor
  inexpensive. The authors first briefly describe the makeup of a database of scanned
  document images of scientific and technical documents written in English which are
  being produced in a CD-ROM format. Then, the authors concentrate on the implementation
  methodology used to prepare the database. The methodology gives the protocols for
  each step of the database preparation, and the error model used for the estimation
  of the ground-truth errors that may exist in the database is discussed.<<ETX>>
