paperAbstract: 'Most current attempts at automatic speech recognition are formulated
  in an artificial intelligence framework. In this paper we approach the problem from
  an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic
  statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to
  the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP).
  For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The
  decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language
  being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing
  the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between
  phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level
  search control. The details of each of the subparts and their interaction during
  the decoding process are discussed.'
