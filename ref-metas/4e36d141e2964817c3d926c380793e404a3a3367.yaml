paperAbstract: We present a statistical model for organizing image collections which
  integrates semantic information provided by associate text and visual information
  provided by image features. The model is very promising for information retrieval
  tasks such as database browsing and searching for images based on text and/or image
  features. Furthermore, since the model learns relationships between text and image
  features, it can be used for novel applications such as associating words with pictures,
  and unsupervised learning for object recognition.
