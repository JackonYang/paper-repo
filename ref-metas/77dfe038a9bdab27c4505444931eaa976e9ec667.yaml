paperAbstract: We present results obtained with several advanced language modeling
  techniques, including class based model, cache model, maximum entropy model, structured
  language model, random forest language model and several types of neural network
  based language models. We show results obtained after combining all these models
  by using linear interpolation. We conclude that for both small and moderately sized
  tasks, we obtain new state of the art results with combination of models, that is
  significantly better than performance of any individual model. Obtained perplexity
  reductions against Good-Turing trigram baseline are over 50% and against modified
  Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram over 40%.
