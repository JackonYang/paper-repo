paperAbstract: This article describes a number of log-linear parsing models for an
  automatically extracted lexicalized grammar. The models are full parsing models
  in the sense that probabilities are defined for complete parses, rather than for
  independent events derived by decomposing the parse tree. Discriminative training
  is used to estimate the models, which requires incorrect parses for each sentence
  in the training data as well as the correct parse. The lexicalized grammar formalism
  used is Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), and the grammar is automatically extracted
  from CCGbank, a CCG version of the Penn Treebank. The combination of discriminative
  training and an automatically extracted grammar leads to a significant memory requirement
  (up to 25 GB), which is satisfied using a parallel implementation of the BFGS optimization
  algorithm running on a Beowulf cluster. Dynamic programming over a packed chart,
  in combination with the parallel implementation, allows us to solve one of the largest-scale
  estimation problems in the statistical parsing literature in under three hours.
  A key component of the parsing system, for both training and testing, is a Maximum
  Entropy supertagger which assigns CCG lexical categories to words in a sentence.
  The supertagger makes the discriminative training feasible, and also leads to a
  highly efficient parser. Surprisingly, given CCG's spurious ambiguity, the parsing
  speeds are significantly higher than those reported for comparable parsers in the
  literature. We also extend the existing parsing techniques for CCG by developing
  a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all derivations, including
  CCG's nonstandard derivations. This model and parsing algorithm, when combined with
  normal-form constraints, give state-of-the-art accuracy for the recovery of predicate-argument
  dependencies from CCGbank. The parser is also evaluated on DepBank and compared
  against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP overall and on the majority of relation
  types. The evaluation on DepBank raises a number of issues regarding parser evaluation.
  This article provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a wide-coverage CCG
  parser. We demonstrate that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible
  with CCG.
