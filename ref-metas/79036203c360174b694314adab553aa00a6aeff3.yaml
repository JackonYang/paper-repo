paperAbstract: This paper presents a prototype system for pedestrian detection on-board
  a moving vehicle. The system uses a generic two-step approach for efficient object
  detection. In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template
  matching approach to efficiently "lock" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching
  is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means
  of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and
  parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force
  method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes
  the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify
  the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental
  results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant
  vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead.
