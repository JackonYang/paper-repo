paperAbstract: We present a method for learning nonlinear systems, echo state networks
  (ESNs). ESNs employ artificial recurrent neural networks in a way that has recently
  been proposed independently as a learning mechanism in biological brains. The learning
  method is computationally efficient and easy to use. On a benchmark task of predicting
  a chaotic time series, accuracy is improved by a factor of 2400 over previous techniques.
  The potential for engineering applications is illustrated by equalizing a communication
  channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders of magnitude.
