paperAbstract: Abstract.Real-world text on street signs, nameplates, etc. often lies
  in an oblique plane and hence cannot be recognized by traditional OCR systems due
  to perspective distortion. Furthermore, such text often comprises only one or two
  lines, preventing the use of existing perspective rectification methods that were
  primarily designed for images of document pages. We propose an approach that reliably
  rectifies and subsequently recognizes individual lines of text. Our system, which
  includes novel algorithms for extraction of text from real-world scenery, perspective
  rectification, and binarization, has been rigorously tested on still imagery as
  well as on MPEG-2 video clips in real time.
