paperAbstract: Our long-range goal is detecting instances from a large number of object
  classes in a computationally efficient manner. Detectors involving a hierarchy of
  tests based on edges have been used elsewhere and shown to be quite fast online.
  However, significant further gains in efficiency in representation, error rates
  and computation can be realized if the family of detectors is constructed from common
  parts. Our parts are flexible, extended edge configurations; they are learned, not
  pre-designed. In training, object classes are presented sequentially; the objective
  is then to accommodate new classes by maximally reusing parts. Ideally, the number
  of distinct parts in the system would grow much more slowly than linearly with the
  number of classes. Initial experiments on learning to detect several hundred LTEXsymbols
  are encouraging.
