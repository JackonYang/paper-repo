paperAbstract: 'In this paper we explore the power of surface text patterns for open-domain
  question answering systems. In order to obtain an optimal set of patterns, we have
  developed a method for learning such patterns automatically. A tagged corpus is
  built from the Internet in a bootstrapping process by providing a few hand-crafted
  examples of each question type to Altavista. Patterns are then automatically extracted
  from the returned documents and standardized. We calculate the precision of each
  pattern, and the average precision for each question type. These patterns are then
  applied to find answers to new questions. Using the TREC-10 question set, we report
  results for two cases: answers determined from the TREC-10 corpus and from the web.'
