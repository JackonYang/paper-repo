paperAbstract: The systems currently available for content based image and video retrieval
  work without semantic knowledge, i.e. they use image processing methods to extract
  low level features of the data. The similarity obtained by these approaches does
  not always correspond to the similarity a human user would expect. A way to include
  more semantic knowledge into the indexing process is to use the text included in
  the images and video sequences. It is rich in information but easy to use, e.g.
  by key word based queries. In this paper we present an algorithm to localize artificial
  text in images and videos using a measure of accumulated gradients and morphological
  post processing to detect the text. The quality of the localized text is improved
  by robust multiple frame integration. Anew technique for the binarization of the
  text boxes is proposed. Finally, detection and OCR results for a commercial OCR
  are presented.
