paperAbstract: We introduce a general and simple structural design called Multiplicative
  Integration (MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the way
  in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the computational
  building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new
  structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and
  GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several
  tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative
  Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing
  RNN models.
