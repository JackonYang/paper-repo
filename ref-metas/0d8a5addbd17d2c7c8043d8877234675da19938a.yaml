paperAbstract: We address the task of inferring the future actions of people from
  noisy visual input. We denote this task activity forecasting. To achieve accurate
  activity forecasting, our approach models the effect of the physical environment
  on the choice of human actions. This is accomplished by the use of state-of-the-art
  semantic scene understanding combined with ideas from optimal control theory. Our
  unified model also integrates several other key elements of activity analysis, namely,
  destination forecasting, sequence smoothing and transfer learning. As proof-of-concept,
  we focus on the domain of trajectory-based activity analysis from visual input.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our model accurately predicts distributions
  over future actions of individuals. We show how the same techniques can improve
  the results of tracking algorithms by leveraging information about likely goals
  and trajectories.
