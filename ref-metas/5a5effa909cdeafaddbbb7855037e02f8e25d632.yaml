paperAbstract: 'We introduce a challenging set of 256 object categories containing
  a total of 30607 images. The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing
  a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually
  screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected
  in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more
  than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from
  31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger
  clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several
  testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset
  using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching
  [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector
  which rejects uninformative background regions.'
