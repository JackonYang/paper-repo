paperAbstract: From spring 1990 through fall 1991, we performed a battery of small
  experiments to test the effectiveness of supplementing knowledge-based techniques
  with probabilistic models. This paper reports our experiments in predicting parts
  of speech of highly ambiguous words, predicting the intended interpretation of an
  utterance when more than one interpretation satisfies all known syntactic and semantic
  constraints, and learning caseframe informationfor verbsfrom example uses.From these
  experiments, we are convinced that probabilistic models based on annotated corpora
  can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire
  lexical informationfrom a corpus, by supplementing knowledge-based techniques.Based
  on the results of those experiments, we have constructed a new natural language
  system (PLUM) for extracting data from text, e.g., newswire text.
