paperAbstract: 'Document clustering has not been well received as an information retrieval
  tool. Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering
  is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of
  documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.

  We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to
  improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information
  access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful
  new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document
  clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering
  algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm.'
