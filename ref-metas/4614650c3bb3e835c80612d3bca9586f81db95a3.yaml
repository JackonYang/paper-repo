paperAbstract: In this paper we present some experiments on the use of a probabilistic
  model to tag English text, i.e. to assign to each word the correct tag (part of
  speech) in the context of the sentence. The main novelty of these experiments is
  the use of untagged text in the training of the model. We have used a simple triclass
  Markov model and are looking for the best way to estimate the parameters of this
  model, depending on the kind and amount of training data provided. Two approaches
  in particular are compared and combined:using text that has been tagged by hand
  and computing relative frequency counts,using text without tags and training the
  model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.Experminents
  show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible.
  They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely
  used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily
  improve the tagging accuracy. In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy,
  except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available.
