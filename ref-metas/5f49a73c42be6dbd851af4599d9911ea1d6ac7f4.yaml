paperAbstract: "This thesis develops two Bayesian learning methods relying on Gaussian\
  \ processes and a rigorous statistical approach for evaluating such methods. In\
  \ these experimental designs the sources of uncertainty in the estimated generalisation\
  \ performances due to both variation in training and test sets are accounted for.\
  \ The framework allows for estimation of generalisation performance as well as statistical\
  \ tests of significance for pairwise comparisons. Two experimental designs are recommended\
  \ and supported by the DELVE software environment. \nTwo new non-parametric Bayesian\
  \ learning methods relying on Gaussian process priors over functions are developed.\
  \ These priors are controlled by hyperparameters which set the characteristic length\
  \ scale for each input dimension. In the simplest method, these parameters are fit\
  \ from the data using optimization. In the second, fully Bayesian method, a Markov\
  \ chain Monte Carlo technique is used to integrate over the hyperparameters. One\
  \ advantage of these Gaussian process methods is that the priors and hyperparameters\
  \ of the trained models are easy to interpret. \nThe Gaussian process methods are\
  \ benchmarked against several other methods, on regression tasks using both real\
  \ data and data generated from realistic simulations. The experiments show that\
  \ small datasets are unsuitable for benchmarking purposes because the uncertainties\
  \ in performance measurements are large. A second set of experiments provide strong\
  \ evidence that the bagging procedure is advantageous for the Multivariate Adaptive\
  \ Regression Splines (MARS) method. \nThe simulated datasets have controlled characteristics\
  \ which make them useful for understanding the relationship between properties of\
  \ the dataset and the performance of different methods. The dependency of the performance\
  \ on available computation time is also investigated. It is shown that a Bayesian\
  \ approach to learning in multi-layer perceptron neural networks achieves better\
  \ performance than the commonly used early stopping procedure, even for reasonably\
  \ short amounts of computation time. The Gaussian process methods are shown to consistently\
  \ outperform the more conventional methods."
