paperAbstract: A class of fast, supervised learning algorithms is presented. They
  use local representations, hashing, and multiple scales of resolution to approximate
  functions which are piece-wise continuous. Inspired by Albus's CMAC model, the algorithms
  learn orders of magnitude more rapidly than typical implementations of back propagation,
  while often achieving comparable qualities of generalization. Furthermore, unlike
  most traditional function approximation methods, the algorithms are well suited
  for use in real time adaptive signal processing. Unlike simpler adaptive systems,
  such as linear predictive coding, the adaptive linear combiner, and the Kalman filter,
  the new algorithms are capable of efficiently capturing the structure of complicated
  non-linear systems. As an illustration, the algorithm is applied to the prediction
  of a chaotic timeseries.
