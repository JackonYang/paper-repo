paperAbstract: Artificial neural networks have been extensively applied to document
  analysis and recognition. Most efforts have been devoted to the recognition of isolated
  handwritten and printed characters with widely recognized successful results. However,
  many other document processing tasks, like preprocessing, layout analysis, character
  segmentation, word recognition, and signature verification, have been effectively
  faced with very promising results. This paper surveys the most significant problems
  in the area of offline document image processing, where connectionist-based approaches
  have been applied. Similarities and differences between approaches belonging to
  different categories are discussed. A particular emphasis is given on the crucial
  role of prior knowledge for the conception of both appropriate architectures and
  learning algorithms. Finally, the paper provides a critical analysts on the reviewed
  approaches and depicts the most promising research guidelines in the field. In particular,
  a second generation of connectionist-based models are foreseen which are based on
  appropriate graphical representations of the learning environment.
