paperAbstract: In this paper we present a visual learning technique that maximizes
  the discrimination between positive and negative examples in a training set. We
  demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background
  without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem.
  We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns
  and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert
  the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes
  the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process
  is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained
  from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these
  models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally
  expensive than neural network approaches. However, no improvement in terms of correct-answer/false-alarm
  tradeoff is achieved.
