paperAbstract: Efficient indexing and retrieval of digital video is an important aspect
  of video databases. One powerful index for retrieval is the text appearing in them.
  It enables content- based browsing. We present our methods for automatic segmentation
  and recognition of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of
  typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation
  and recognition performance. Especially the inter-frame dependencies of the characters
  provide new possibilities for their refinement. Then, a straightforward indexing
  and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate
  that the proposed text segmentation and text recognition algorithms are suitable
  for indexing and retrieval of relevant video scenes in and from a video data base.
  Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms
  can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher semantics
  in video.
