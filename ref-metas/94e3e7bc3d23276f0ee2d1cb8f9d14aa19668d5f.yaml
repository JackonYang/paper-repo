paperAbstract: An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of
  adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures. These transferable
  adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications.
  Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this
  work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over
  large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability
  of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted
  and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted
  adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using
  existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we
  propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples.
  Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples
  that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present
  some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples.
  Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches
  can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification
  system.
