paperAbstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm for sense disambiguation
  that, when trained on unannotated English text, rivals the performance of supervised
  techniques that require time-consuming hand annotations. The algorithm is based
  on two powerful constraints---that words tend to have one sense per discourse and
  one sense per collocation---exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure. Tested
  accuracy exceeds 96%.
