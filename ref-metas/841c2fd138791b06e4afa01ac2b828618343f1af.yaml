paperAbstract: We report the status of the UNIPEN project of data exchange and recognizer
  benchmarks started two years ago at the initiative of the International Association
  of Pattern Recognition (Technical Committee 11). The purpose of the project is to
  propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online
  handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies
  and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a
  protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include
  handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures
  and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic
  Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of
  Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We
  explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks.
