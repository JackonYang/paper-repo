paperAbstract: Recently, scene text detection has become an active research topic
  in computer vision and document analysis, because of its great importance and significant
  challenge. However, vast majority of the existing methods detect text within local
  regions, typically through extracting character, word or line level candidates followed
  by candidate aggregation and false positive elimination, which potentially exclude
  the effect of wide-scope and long-range contextual cues in the scene. To take full
  advantage of the rich information available in the whole natural image, we propose
  to localize text in a holistic manner, by casting scene text detection as a semantic
  segmentation problem. The proposed algorithm directly runs on full images and produces
  global, pixel-wise prediction maps, in which detections are subsequently formed.
  To better make use of the properties of text, three types of information regarding
  text region, individual characters and their relationship are estimated, with a
  single Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. With such predictions of text properties,
  the proposed algorithm can simultaneously handle horizontal, multi-oriented and
  curved text in real-world natural images. The experiments on standard benchmarks,
  including ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
  substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we report
  the first baseline result on the recently-released, large-scale dataset COCO-Text.
