paperAbstract: In this paper, we present a large-scale object retrieval system. The
  user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system
  returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large
  corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset
  of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using
  Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time
  and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem
  we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a
  novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the
  current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that
  the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query
  performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results
  returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search
  quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view
  this work as a promising step towards much larger, "web-scale " image corpora.
