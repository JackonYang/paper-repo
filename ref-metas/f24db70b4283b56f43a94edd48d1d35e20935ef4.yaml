paperAbstract: In this research, we aim to ground scene recognition on information
  other than the identity of component objects. Specifically we seek to understand
  the structure of color cues that allows the express recognition of scene gists.
  Using the L*a*b* color space we examined the conditions under which chromatic cues
  concur with brightness to allow a viewer to recognize scenes at a glance. Using
  different methods, Experiments 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that colors do contribute
  when they are diagnostic (i.e., predictive) of a scene category. Experiment 3 examined
  the structure of colored cues at different spatial scales that are responsible for
  the effects of color diagnosticity reported in Experiments 1 and 2. Together, the
  results suggest that colored blobs at a coarse spatial scale concur with luminance
  cues to form the relevant spatial layout that mediates express scene recognition.
