paperAbstract: "Recent studies show that an overwhelming majority of emails are machine-generated\
  \ and sent by businesses to consumers. Many large email services are interested\
  \ in extracting structured data from such emails to enable intelligent assistants.\
  \ This allows experiences like being able to answer questions such as \u201CWhat\
  \ is the address of my hotel in New York?\u201D or \u201CWhen does my flight leave?\u201D\
  . A high-quality email classifier is a critical piece in such a system. In this\
  \ paper, we argue that the rich formatting used in business-to-consumer emails contains\
  \ valuable information that can be used to learn better representations. Most existing\
  \ methods focus only on textual content and ignore the rich HTML structure of emails.\
  \ We introduce RiSER (Richly Structured Email Representation) - an approach for\
  \ incorporating both the structure and content of emails. RiSER projects the email\
  \ into a vector representation by jointly encoding the HTML structure and the words\
  \ in the email. We then use this representation to train a classifier. To our knowledge,\
  \ this is the first description of a neural technique for combining formatting information\
  \ along with the content to learn improved representations for richly formatted\
  \ emails. Experimenting with a large corpus of emails received by users of Gmail,\
  \ we show that RiSER outperforms strong attention-based LSTM baselines. We expect\
  \ that these benefits will extend to other corpora with richly formatted documents.\
  \ We also demonstrate with examples where leveraging HTML structure leads to better\
  \ predictions."
