paperAbstract: "I begin with an intuition: when I read a sentence, I read it a chunk\
  \ at a time. For example, the previous sentence breaks up something like this: \n\
  \ \n(1) \n \n[I begin] [with an intuition]: [when I read] [a sentence], [I read\
  \ it] [a chunk] [at a time] \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese chunks correspond in some\
  \ way to prosodic patterns. It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses\
  \ in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between\
  \ chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk\
  \ consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words,\
  \ matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to\
  \ describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks\
  \ are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence\
  \ of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive\
  \ to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much\
  \ more flexible than the order of words within chunks."
