paperAbstract: Although the potential of the powerful mapping and representational
  capabilities of recurrent network architectures is generally recognized by the neural
  network research community, recurrent neural networks have not been widely used
  for the control of nonlinear dynamical systems, possibly due to the relative ineffectiveness
  of simple gradient descent training algorithms. Developments in the use of parameter-based
  extended Kalman filter algorithms for training recurrent networks may provide a
  mechanism by which these architectures will prove to be of practical value. This
  paper presents a decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) algorithm for training
  of recurrent networks with special emphasis on application to control problems.
  We demonstrate in simulation the application of the DEKF algorithm to a series of
  example control problems ranging from the well-known cart-pole and bioreactor benchmark
  problems to an automotive subsystem, engine idle speed control. These simulations
  suggest that recurrent controller networks trained by Kalman filter methods can
  combine the traditional features of state-space controllers and observers in a homogeneous
  architecture for nonlinear dynamical systems, while simultaneously exhibiting less
  sensitivity than do purely feedforward controller networks to changes in plant parameters
  and measurement noise.
