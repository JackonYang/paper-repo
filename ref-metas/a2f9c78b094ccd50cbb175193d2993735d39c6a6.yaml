paperAbstract: Sensations of color show a strong correlation with reflectance, even
  though the amount of visible light reaching the eye depends on the product of reflectance
  and illumination. The visual system must achieve this remarkable result by a scheme
  that does not measure flux. Such a scheme is described as the basis of retinex theory.
  This theory assumes that there are three independent cone systems, each starting
  with a set of receptors peaking, respectively, in the long-, middle-, and short-wavelength
  regions of the visible spectrum. Each system forms a separate image of the world
  in terms of lightness that shows a strong correlation with reflectance within its
  particular band of wavelengths. These images are not mixed, but rather are compared
  to generate color sensations. The problem then becomes how the lightness of areas
  in these separate images can be independent of flux. This article describes the
  mathematics of a lightness scheme that generates lightness numbers, the biologic
  correlate of reflectance, independent of the flux from objects
