paperAbstract: The language model probabilities are estimated by an empirical Bayes
  approach in which a prior distribution for the unknown probabilities is itself estimated
  through a novel choice of data. The predictive power of the model thus fitted is
  compared by means of its experimental perplexity [1] to the model as fitted by the
  Jelinek-Mercer deleted estimator and as fitted by the Turing-Good formulas for probabilities
  of unseen or rarely seen events.
