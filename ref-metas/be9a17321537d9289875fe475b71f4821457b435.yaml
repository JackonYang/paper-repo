paperAbstract: "A great deal of research has focused on algorithms for learning features\
  \ from unlabeled data. Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark datasets\
  \ like NORB and CIFAR by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms\
  \ and deep models. In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors,\
  \ such as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more important to achieving\
  \ high performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically,\
  \ we will apply several othe-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders,\
  \ sparse RBMs, K-means clustering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR, NORB, and STL\
  \ datasets using only singlelayer networks. We then present a detailed analysis\
  \ of the eect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size, number of\
  \ hidden nodes (features), the step-size (\u201Cstride\u201D) between extracted\
  \ features, and the eect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden\
  \ nodes and dense feature extraction are critical to achieving high performance\u2014\
  so critical, in fact, that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we\
  \ achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single\
  \ layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means\
  \ clustering, which is extremely fast, has no hyperparameters to tune beyond the\
  \ model structure itself, and is very easy to implement. Despite the simplicity\
  \ of our system, we achieve accuracy beyond all previously published results on\
  \ the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6% and 97.2% respectively)."
