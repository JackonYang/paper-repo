paperAbstract: We consider the general problem of utilizing both labeled and unlabeled
  data to improve classification accuracy. Under the assumption that the data lie
  on a submanifold in a high dimensional space, we develop an algorithmic framework
  to classify a partially labeled data set in a principled manner. The central idea
  of our approach is that classification functions are naturally defined only on the
  sub-manifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the Laplace
  Beltrami operator one produces a basis for a Hilbert space of square integrable
  functions on the submanifold. To recover such a basis, only unlabeled examples are
  required. Once a basis is obtained, training can be performed using the labeled
  data set. Our algorithm models the manifold using the adjacency graph for the data
  and approximates the Laplace Beltrami operator by the graph Laplacian. Practical
  applications to image and text classification are considered.
