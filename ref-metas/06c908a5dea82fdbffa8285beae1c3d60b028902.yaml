paperAbstract: Results from an ongoing project concerned with recognizing objects
  in complex scene domains, especially in the domain that includes the natural outdoor
  world, are described. Traditional machine recognition paradigms assume either that
  all objects of interest are definable by a relatively small number of explicit shape
  models or that all objects of interest have characteristic, locally measurable features.
  The failure of both assumptions has a dramatic impact on the form of an acceptable
  architecture for an object recognition system. In this work, the use of the contextual
  information is a central issue, and a system is explicitly designed to identify
  and use context as an integral part of recognition that eliminates the traditional
  dependence on stored geometric models and universal image partitioning algorithms.
  This paradigm combines the results of many simple procedures that analyze monochrome,
  color, stereo, or 3D range images. Interpreting the results along with relevant
  contextual knowledge makes it possible to achieve a reliable recognition result,
  even when using imperfect visual procedures. Initial experimentation with the system
  on ground-level outdoor imagery has demonstrated competence beyond what is attainable
  with other vision systems. >
