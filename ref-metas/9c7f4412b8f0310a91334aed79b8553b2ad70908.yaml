paperAbstract: Recently, there has been much effort in making databases for molecular
  biology more accessible and interoperable. However, information in text form, such
  as MEDLINE records, remains a greatly underutilized source of biological information.
  We have begun a research effort aimed at automatically mapping information from
  text sources into structured representations, such as knowledge bases. Our approach
  to this task is to use machine-learning methods to induce routines for extracting
  facts from text. We describe two learning methods that we have applied to this task--a
  statistical text classification method, and a relational learning method--and our
  initial experiments in learning such information-extraction routines. We also present
  an approach to decreasing the cost of learning information-extraction routines by
  learning from "weakly" labeled training data.
