paperAbstract: 'A new technique for the analysis of speech, the perceptual linear
  predictive (PLP) technique, is presented and examined. This technique uses three
  concepts from the psychophysics of hearing to derive an estimate of the auditory
  spectrum: (1) the critical-band spectral resolution, (2) the equal-loudness curve,
  and (3) the intensity-loudness power law. The auditory spectrum is then approximated
  by an autoregressive all-pole model. A 5th-order all-pole model is effective in
  suppressing speaker-dependent details of the auditory spectrum. In comparison with
  conventional linear predictive (LP) analysis, PLP analysis is more consistent with
  human hearing. The effective second formant F2'' and the 3.5-Bark spectral-peak
  integration theories of vowel perception are well accounted for. PLP analysis is
  computationally efficient and yields a low-dimensional representation of speech.
  These properties are found to be useful in speaker-independent automatic-speech
  recognition.'
