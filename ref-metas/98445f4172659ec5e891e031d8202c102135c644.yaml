paperAbstract: 'We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet
  is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts,
  one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The
  two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and
  preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths
  of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder
  is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses
  dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting
  network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of
  the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet
  decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling
  and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The
  ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine
  translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable
  neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional
  pooling and run in quadratic time. We find that the latent alignment structure contained
  in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.'
