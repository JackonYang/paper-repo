paperAbstract: We have created the first image search engine based entirely on faces.
  Using simple text queries such as "smiling men with blond hair and mustaches," users
  can search through over 3.1 million faces which have been automatically labeled
  on the basis of several facial attributes. Faces in our database have been extracted
  and aligned from images downloaded from the internet using a commercial face detector,
  and the number of images and attributes continues to grow daily. Our classification
  approach uses a novel combination of Support Vector Machines and Adaboost which
  exploits the strong structure of faces to select and train on the optimal set of
  features for each attribute. We show state-of-the-art classification results compared
  to previous works, and demonstrate the power of our architecture through a functional,
  large-scale face search engine. Our framework is fully automatic, easy to scale,
  and computes all labels off-line, leading to fast on-line search performance. In
  addition, we describe how our system can be used for a number of applications, including
  law enforcement, social networks, and personal photo management. Our search engine
  will soon be made publicly available.
