paperAbstract: Digital library access is driven by features, but the relevance of
  a feature for a query is not always obvious. This paper describes an approach for
  integrating a large number of context-dependent features into a semi-automated tool.
  Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant
  features, the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining
  groupings of the data, where groupings can be induced by highly specialized features.
  The selection process is guided by positive and negative examples from the user.
  The inherent combinatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage
  grouping generation, weighting, and collection process. The stages closest to the
  user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier
  stages. The weighting stage adapts the collection stage's search space across uses,
  so that, in later interactions, good groupings are found given few examples from
  the user.
