paperAbstract: "This paper describes a new framework for processing images by example,\
  \ called \u201Cimage analogies.\u201D The framework involves two stages: a design\
  \ phase, in which a pair of images, with one image purported to be a \u201Cfiltered\u201D\
  \ version of the other, is presented as \u201Ctraining data\u201D; and an application\
  \ phase, in which the learned filter is applied to some new target image in order\
  \ to create an \u201Canalogous\u201D filtered result. Image analogies are based\
  \ on a simple multi-scale autoregression, inspired primarily by recent results in\
  \ texture synthesis. By choosing different types of source image pairs as input,\
  \ the framework supports a wide variety of \u201Cimage filter\u201D effects, including\
  \ traditional image filters, such as blurring or embossing; improved texture synthesis,\
  \ in which some textures are synthesized with higher quality than by previous approaches;\
  \ super-resolution, in which a higher-resolution image is inferred from a low-resolution\
  \ source; texture transfer, in which images are \u201Ctexturized\u201D with some\
  \ arbitrary source texture; artistic filters, in which various drawing and painting\
  \ styles are synthesized based on scanned real-world examples; and texture-by-numbers,\
  \ in which realistic scenes, composed of a variety of textures, are created using\
  \ a simple painting interface."
