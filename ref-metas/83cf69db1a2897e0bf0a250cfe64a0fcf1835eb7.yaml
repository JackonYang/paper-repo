paperAbstract: "Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate\
  \ cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from\
  \ ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in\
  \ all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well\
  \ as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal\
  \ circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source\
  \ of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating\
  \ the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following\
  \ changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were\
  \ found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased,\
  \ or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination.\
  \ In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to\
  \ 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established.\
  \ A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed:\
  \ (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's\
  \ type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between\
  \ \u20130.10 and \u20130.24, with a mean value of \u20130.17, which is significantly\
  \ different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were\
  \ not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time\
  \ depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in\
  \ such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression\
  \ of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which\
  \ spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed."
