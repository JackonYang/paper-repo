paperAbstract: '!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to
  recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter,
  and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects
  whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible
  templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice
  model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness
  during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform
  in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method
  for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly
  annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement
  algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key
  difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways
  consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have
  built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered
  images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN.'
