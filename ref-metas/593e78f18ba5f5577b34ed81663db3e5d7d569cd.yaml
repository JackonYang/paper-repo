paperAbstract: Text localization and recognition in images is important for searching
  information in digital photo archives, video databases and Web sites. However, since
  text is often printed against a complex background, it is often difficult to detect.
  In this paper, a robust text localization approach is presented, which can automatically
  detect horizontally aligned text with different sizes, fonts, colors and languages.
  First, a wavelet transform is applied to the image and the distribution of high-frequency
  wavelet coefficients is considered to statistically characterize text and non-text
  areas. Then, the k-means algorithm is used to classify text areas in the image.
  The detected text areas undergo a projection analysis in order to refine their localization.
  Finally, a binary segmented text image is generated, to be used as input to an OCR
  engine. The detection performance of our approach is demonstrated by presenting
  experimental results for a set of video frames taken from the MPEG-7 video test
  set.
