paperAbstract: A new recursive algorithm of stochastic approximation type with the
  averaging of trajectories is investigated. Convergence with probability one is proved
  for a variety of classical optimization and identification problems. It is also
  demonstrated for these problems that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest
  possible rate of convergence.
