paperAbstract: 'Human ability to understand language is general, flexible, and robust.
  In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task
  and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding
  beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs,
  then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic
  tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present
  the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark
  of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding
  of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing
  models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it
  is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models
  that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient
  learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets
  in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held
  test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate
  baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique,
  as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still
  achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields
  similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.'
