paperAbstract: We consider here the problem of building a never-ending language learner;
  that is, an intelligent computer agent that runs forever and that each day must
  (1) extract, or read, information from the web to populate a growing structured
  knowledge base, and (2) learn to perform this task better than on the previous day.
  In particular, we propose an approach and a set of design principles for such an
  agent, describe a partial implementation of such a system that has already learned
  to extract a knowledge base containing over 242,000 beliefs with an estimated precision
  of 74% after running for 67 days, and discuss lessons learned from this preliminary
  attempt to build a never-ending learning agent.
