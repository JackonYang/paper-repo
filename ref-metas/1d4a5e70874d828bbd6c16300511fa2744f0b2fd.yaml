paperAbstract: In this paper a method is proposed for locating horizontal, uniform-colored
  text in video frames. It was observed that when a row of pixels across such a text
  region is clustered in perceptually uniform L*a*b* color space, the pixels of one
  of these clusters would belong to the text strokes. These pixels would appeal as
  a line of short streaks on the row since a typical text region has many vertical
  and diagonal strokes. The proposed method examines every third row of the the image
  and checks whether this row passes through a horizontal text region. For a given
  row R, the pixels of R are hierarchically clustered in L*a*b* space and each cluster
  is tested whether similar-colored pixels in R's vicinity are possibly part of a
  text region. Candidate text blocks are marked by heuristics using information about
  the cluster's line of shell streaks. The detected text blocks are fused with the
  text regions. The method was tested on key frames of several video sequences and
  was able to locate a wide variety of text.
