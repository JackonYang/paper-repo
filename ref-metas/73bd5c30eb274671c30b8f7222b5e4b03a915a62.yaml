paperAbstract: We present a novel statistical and variational approach to image segmentation
  based on a new algorithm, named region competition. This algorithm is derived by
  minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using
  the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum
  and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons
  and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide
  theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location,
  criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters.
  It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and
  we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel
  color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining
  segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions.
