paperAbstract: While syntactic dependency annotations concentrate on the surface or
  functional structure of a sentence, semantic dependency annotations aim to capture
  between-word relationships that are more closely related to the meaning of a sentence,
  using graph-structured representations. We extend the LSTM-based syntactic parser
  of Dozat and Manning (2017) to train on and generate these graph structures. The
  resulting system on its own achieves state-of-the-art performance, beating the previous,
  substantially more complex state-of-the-art system by 0.6% labeled F1. Adding linguistically
  richer input representations pushes the margin even higher, allowing us to beat
  it by 1.9% labeled F1.
