paperAbstract: 'Abstract.In this paper a system for processing documents that can
  be grouped into classes is illustrated. We have considered invoices as a case-study.
  The system is divided into three phases: document analysis, classification, and
  understanding. We illustrate the analysis and understanding phases. The system is
  based on knowledge constructed by means of a learning procedure. The experimental
  results demonstrate the reliability of our document analysis and understanding procedures.
  They also present evidence that it is possible to use a small learning set of invoices
  to obtain reliable knowledge for the understanding phase.'
