paperAbstract: 'These are the short notes for a two hour tutorial on principles and
  practice of computer graphics and scientific visualization. They are intended to
  summarize the contents of the tutorial transparencies and slides but they cannot
  completely replace them since restrictions in space and print quality do not permit
  the inclusion of figures and example images. For further reference the following
  standard text should be consulted: [3, 8, 5, 1, 6, 2, 9]'
