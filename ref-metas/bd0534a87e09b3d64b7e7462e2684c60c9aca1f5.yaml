paperAbstract: This paper presents a trainable object detection architecture that
  is applied to detecting people in static images of cluttered scenes. This problem
  poses several challenges. People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree
  of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this
  system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models
  or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet
  template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet
  coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can
  be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We
  show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template
  make it an effective tool for object detection.
