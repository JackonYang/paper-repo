paperAbstract: 'A language model is a conceptual device which, given a string of past
  words, provides an estimate of the probability that any given word from an allowed
  vocabulary will follow the string. In speech recognition, a language model is used
  to direct the hypothesis search for the sentence that was spoken. In fact, its probability
  assignments are a factor in evaluating the likelihood that any word string was uttered,
  and in ordering the word string hypotheses to be examined (1). Language models are
  also useful in text encoding for compression or transmission, in character recognition
  of printed or handwritten text, etc. Ideally, the probability assigned by a language
  model to any word should depend on the entire past sequence of words. However, it
  is practically impossible to implement such a dependence: 1) The probability estimate
  involved would have to be extracted from a giant sample of training text containing
  billions of words; 2) If the probabilities were extractable, sufficient space in
  computer memory could not be found to store them.'
