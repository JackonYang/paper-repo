paperAbstract: "Historical document collections are a valuable resource for human\
  \ history. This paper proposes a novel digital image binarization scheme for low\
  \ quality historical documents allowing further content exploitation in an efficient\
  \ way. The proposed scheme consists of five distinct steps: a pre-processing procedure\
  \ using a low-pass Wiener filter, a rough estimation of foreground regions using\
  \ Niblack\u2019s approach, a background surface calculation by interpolating neighboring\
  \ background intensities, a thresholding by combining the calculated background\
  \ surface with the original image and finally a post-processing step in order to\
  \ improve the quality of text regions and preserve stroke connectivity. The proposed\
  \ methodology works with great success even in cases of historical manuscripts with\
  \ poor quality, shadows, nonuniform illumination, low contrast, large signal- dependent\
  \ noise, smear and strain. After testing the proposed method on numerous low quality\
  \ historical manuscripts, it has turned out that our methodology performs better\
  \ compared to current state-of-the-art adaptive thresholding techniques."
