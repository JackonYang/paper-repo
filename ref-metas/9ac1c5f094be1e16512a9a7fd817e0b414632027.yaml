paperAbstract: Text detection in natural scene images is an important prerequisite
  for many content-based image analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose an accurate
  and robust method for detecting texts in natural scene images. A fast and effective
  pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs)
  as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations.
  Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering
  algorithm, where distance weights and clustering threshold are learned automatically
  by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. The posterior probabilities
  of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with a character classifier;
  text candidates with high non-text probabilities are eliminated and texts are identified
  with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust
  Reading Competition database; the f-measure is over 76%, much better than the state-of-the-art
  performance of 71%. Experiments on multilingual, street view, multi-orientation
  and even born-digital databases also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  method.
