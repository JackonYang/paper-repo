paperAbstract: Relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains
  an open and challenging area of research. The semantic meaning of images depends
  on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects.
  But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual
  information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem.
  In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created
  from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow
  for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they
  remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors,
  or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow
  the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets
  of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002
  sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions.
  We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features,
  the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.
