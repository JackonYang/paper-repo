paperAbstract: One major goal of research on massively parallel networks of neuron-like
  processing elements is to discover efficient methods for recognizing patterns. Another
  goal is to discover general learning procedures that allow networks to construct
  the internal representations that are required for complex tasks. This paper describes
  a recently developed procedure that can learn to perform a recognition task. The
  network is trained on examples in which the input vector represents an instance
  of a pattern in a particular position and the required output vector represents
  its name. After prolonged training, the network develops canonical internal representations
  of the patterns and it uses these canonical representations to identify familiar
  patterns in novel positions.
