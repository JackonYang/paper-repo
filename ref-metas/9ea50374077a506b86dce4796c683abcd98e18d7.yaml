paperAbstract: "This paper provides a foundation for a practical way of improving\
  \ the effectiveness of an automatic retrieval system. Its main concern is with the\
  \ weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously\
  \ index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then\
  \ a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely\
  \ to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption.\
  \ Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used\
  \ to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the\
  \ values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small\
  \ samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in\
  \ particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required\
  \ for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."
