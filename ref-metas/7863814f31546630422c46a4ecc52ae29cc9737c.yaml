paperAbstract: This paper describes a framework for the automatic Web-based evaluation
  and deployment of pattern recognizers. Several usage modes are identified and the
  issues and tradeoffs involved in designing Web-based evaluation systems are discussed.
  The system operates by exchanging XML messages between a recognition client and
  an evaluation server. HTTP POST is used for message exchange, which works through
  most firewalls. To use the system a researcher downloads a simple evaluation client,
  and then uses this client to invoke their recognizer. The recognizer must implement
  a simple problem-specific interface. The system is illustrated with the aid of a
  sequence recognition example.
