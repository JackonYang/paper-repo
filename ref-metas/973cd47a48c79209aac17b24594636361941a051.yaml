paperAbstract: We present a novel inference algorithm for arbitrary, binary, undirected
  graphs. Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we
  directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases,
  first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabilities at
  each unit, using an analytic expression. Next, we update the marginal probabilities,
  by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed
  to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm
  is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy
  is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments
  we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions
  as our belief optimization method. The stable nature of belief optimization makes
  it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data.
