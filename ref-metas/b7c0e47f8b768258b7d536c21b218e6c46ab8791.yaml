paperAbstract: This paper presents recent work using the CHILL parser acquisition
  system to automate the construction of a natural-language interface for database
  queries. CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules
  within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from
  Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with
  a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train
  on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers
  that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results
  with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is
  able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These
  results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely
  syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an
  empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application.
