paperAbstract: "From the Publisher: \nThe updated new edition of the classic Introduction\
  \ to Algorithms is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses\
  \ in algorithms or data structures. Like the first edition,this text can also be\
  \ used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering\
  \ issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction\
  \ to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern\
  \ study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years\
  \ since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms\
  \ in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been\
  \ included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and\
  \ material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new\
  \ information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this\
  \ new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms\
  \ and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible\
  \ to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to\
  \ make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds.\
  \ \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or\
  \ a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor\
  \ can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's\
  \ needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition\
  \ in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises\
  \ thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
