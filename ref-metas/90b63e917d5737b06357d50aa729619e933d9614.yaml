paperAbstract: 'Straightforward application of Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) to acoustic
  modeling produces a rich distributed representation of speech data that is useful
  for recognition and yields impressive results on the speaker-independent TIMIT phone
  recognition task. However, the first-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann
  Machine (GRBM) has an important limitation, shared with mixtures of diagonal-covariance
  Gaussians: GRBMs treat different components of the acoustic input vector as conditionally
  independent given the hidden state. The mean-covariance restricted Boltzmann machine
  (mcRBM), first introduced for modeling natural images, is a much more representationally
  efficient and powerful way of modeling the covariance structure of speech data.
  Every configuration of the precision units of the mcRBM specifies a different precision
  matrix for the conditional distribution over the acoustic space. In this work, we
  use the mcRBM to learn features of speech data that serve as input into a standard
  DBN. The mcRBM features combined with DBNs allow us to achieve a phone error rate
  of 20.5%, which is superior to all published results on speaker-independent TIMIT
  to date.'
