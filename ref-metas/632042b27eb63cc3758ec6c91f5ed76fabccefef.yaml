paperAbstract: We describe an unsupervised method to segment objects detected in images
  using a novel variant of an interest point template, which is very efficient to
  train and evaluate. Once an object has been detected, our method segments an image
  using a conditional random field (CRF) model. This model integrates image gradients,
  the location and scale of the object, the presence of object parts, and the tendency
  of these parts to have characteristic patterns of edges nearby. We enhance our method
  using multiple unsegmented images of objects to learn the parameters of the CRF,
  in an iterative conditional maximization framework. We show quantitative results
  on images of real scenes that demonstrate the accuracy of segmentation.
