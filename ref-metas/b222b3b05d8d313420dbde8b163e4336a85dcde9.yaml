paperAbstract: Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information
  at the level of complexity higher than typical "visual words", but lower than full-blown
  semantic objects. Several approaches [5,6,12,23] have been proposed to discover
  mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring
  within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches
  are rather ad hoc and difficult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual
  element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the
  well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled
  image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are
  maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation
  is that it requires only a single pass through the data. We also propose the Purity-Coverage
  plot as a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual
  discovery approaches, and compare our method against prior work on the Paris Street
  View dataset of [5]. We also evaluate our method on the task of scene classification,
  demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset.
