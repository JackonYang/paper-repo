paperAbstract: 'We investigate unsupervised techniques for acquiring monolingual sentence-level
  paraphrases from a corpus of temporally and topically clustered news articles collected
  from thousands of web-based news sources. Two techniques are employed: (1) simple
  string edit distance, and (2) a heuristic strategy that pairs initial (presumably
  summary) sentences from different news stories in the same cluster. We evaluate
  both datasets using a word alignment algorithm and a metric borrowed from machine
  translation. Results show that edit distance data is cleaner and more easily-aligned
  than the heuristic data, with an overall alignment error rate (AER) of 11.58% on
  a similarly-extracted test set. On test data extracted by the heuristic strategy,
  however, performance of the two training sets is similar, with AERs of 13.2% and
  14.7% respectively. Analysis of 100 pairs of sentences from each set reveals that
  the edit distance data lacks many of the complex lexical and syntactic alternations
  that characterize monolingual paraphrase. The summary sentences, while less readily
  alignable, retain more of the non-trivial alternations that are of greatest interest
  learning paraphrase relationships.'
