paperAbstract: In this paper we describe our work on 3-D model-based tracking and
  recognition of human movement from real images. Our system has two major components.
  The rst component takes real image sequences acquired from multiple views and recovers
  the 3-D body pose at each time instant. The pose-recovery problem is formulated
  as a search problem and entails nding the pose parameters of a graphical human model
  for which its synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of
  the real human in the multi-view images. Currently, we use a best-rst search technique
  and chamfer matching as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge
  images. The second component of our system deals with the representation and recognition
  of human movement patterns. The recognition of human movement patterns is considered
  as a classiication problem involving the matching of a test sequence with several
  reference sequences representing prototypical activities. A variation of dynamic
  time-warping is used to match movement patterns using 3-D joint angles as features.
  We illustrate our approach on real data acquired simultaneously from three views
  and data derived from stereo Moving Light Displays with diierent types of hand-gestures.
