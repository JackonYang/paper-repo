paperAbstract: 'We investigate the effectiveness of connectionist architectures for
  predicting the future behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. We focus on real-world
  time series of limited record length. Two examples are analyzed: the benchmark sunspot
  series and chaotic data from a computational ecosystem. The problem of overfitting,
  particularly serious for short records of noisy data, is addressed both by using
  the statistical method of validation and by adding a complexity term to the cost
  function ("back-propagation with weight-elimination"). The dimension of the dynamics
  underlying the time series, its Liapunov coefficient, and its nonlinearity can be
  determined via the network. We also show why sigmoid units are superior in performance
  to radial basis functions for high-dimensional input spaces. Furthermore, since
  the ultimate goal is accuracy in the prediction, we find that sigmoid networks trained
  with the weight-elimination algorithm outperform traditional nonlinear statistical
  approaches.'
