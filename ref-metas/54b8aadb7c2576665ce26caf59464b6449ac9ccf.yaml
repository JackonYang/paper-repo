paperAbstract: Past work in relation extraction has focused on binary relations in
  single sentences. Recent NLP inroads in high-value domains have sparked interest
  in the more general setting of extracting n-ary relations that span multiple sentences.
  In this paper, we explore a general relation extraction framework based on graph
  long short-term memory networks (graph LSTMs) that can be easily extended to cross-sentence
  n-ary relation extraction. The graph formulation provides a unified way of exploring
  different LSTM approaches and incorporating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential
  dependencies, such as sequential, syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual
  representation is learned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation
  classifier. This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enables
  multi-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in two important
  precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both conventional
  supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentence extraction produced
  larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learning significantly improved extraction
  accuracy. A thorough analysis of various LSTM approaches yielded useful insight
  the impact of linguistic analysis on extraction accuracy.
