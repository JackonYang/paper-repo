paperAbstract: We present a library that provides optimized implementations for deep
  learning primitives. Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and
  optimizing the kernels of deep learning workloads is difficult and time-consuming.
  As parallel architectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized for new processors,
  which makes maintaining codebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long
  been addressed in the HPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra
  Subroutines (BLAS) [2]. However, there is no analogous library for deep learning.
  Without such a library, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel
  processors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main computational
  kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel processors emerge. To address
  this problem, we have created a library similar in intent to BLAS, with optimized
  routines for deep learning workloads. Our implementation contains routines for GPUs,
  and similarly to the BLAS library, could be implemented for other platforms. The
  library is easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized performance
  and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a popular framework
  for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a standard model while
  also reducing memory consumption.
