paperAbstract: A probabilistic method for tracking 3D articulated human figures in
  monocular image sequences is presented. Within a Bayesian framework, we define a
  generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image
  graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint
  angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over
  model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated
  over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized
  optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also
  extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera
  model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular
  sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities
  due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method
  relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is
  able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and
  with complex unknown backgrounds.
