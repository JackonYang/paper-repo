paperAbstract: Extracting Text of Interest (ToI) from images is a crucial part of
  many OCR applications, such as entity recognition of cards, invoices, and receipts.
  Most of the existing works employ complicated engineering pipeline, which contains
  OCR and structure information extraction, to fulfill this task. This paper proposes
  an Entity-aware Attention Text Extraction Network called EATEN, which is an end-to-end
  trainable system to extract the ToIs without any post-processing. In the proposed
  framework, each entity is parsed by its corresponding entity-aware decoder, respectively.
  Moreover, we innovatively introduce a state transition mechanism which further improves
  the robustness of visual ToI extraction. In consideration of the absence of public
  benchmarks, we construct a dataset of almost 0.6 million images in three real-world
  scenarios (train ticket, passport and business card), which is publicly available
  at https://github.com/beacandler/EATEN. To the best of our knowledge, EATEN is the
  first single shot method to extract entities from images. Extensive experiments
  on these benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of EATEN.
