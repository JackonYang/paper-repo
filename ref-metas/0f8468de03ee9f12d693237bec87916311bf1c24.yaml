paperAbstract: "This paper presents the Seventh Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-7)\
  \ challenge. This year\u2019s challenge replicated the exercise proposed in RTE-6,\
  \ consisting of a Main Task, in which Textual Entailment is performed on a real\
  \ corpus in the Update Summarization scenario; a Main subtask aimed at detecting\
  \ novel information; and a KBP Validation Task, in which RTE systems had to validate\
  \ the output of systems participating in the KBP Slot Filling Task. Thirteen teams\
  \ participated in the Main Task (submitting 33 runs) and 5 in the Novelty Detection\
  \ Subtask (submitting 13 runs). The KBP Validation Task was undertaken by 2 participants\
  \ which submitted 5 runs. The ablation test experiment, introduced in RTE-5 to evaluate\
  \ the impact of knowledge resources used by the systems participating in the Main\
  \ Task and extended also to tools in RTE-6, was also repeated in RTE-7."
