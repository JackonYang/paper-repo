paperAbstract: Crowd-sourcing approaches such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
  make it possible to annotate or collect large amounts of linguistic data at a relatively
  low cost and high speed. However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is
  allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for
  tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct
  answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot
  be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers
  are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of
  images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the
  effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic
  data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides
  the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up
  tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora,
  totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images.
