paperAbstract: We present a semi-Markov model for recognizing scene text that integrates
  character and word segmentation with recognition. Using wavelet features, it requires
  only approximate location of the text baseline and font size; no binarization or
  prior word segmentation is necessary. Our system is aided by a lexicon, yet it also
  allows non-lexicon words. To facilitate inference with a large lexicon, we use an
  approximate Viterbi beam search. Our system performs robustly on low-resolution
  images of signs containing text in fonts atypical of documents.
