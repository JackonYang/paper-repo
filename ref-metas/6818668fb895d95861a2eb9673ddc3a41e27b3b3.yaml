paperAbstract: The problem we are addressing in Alvey Project MMI149 is that of using
  computer vision to understand the unconstrained 3D world, in which the viewed scenes
  will in general contain too wide a diversity of objects for topdown recognition
  techniques to work. For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural
  scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two
  frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that
  we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of
  a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image
  features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed.
