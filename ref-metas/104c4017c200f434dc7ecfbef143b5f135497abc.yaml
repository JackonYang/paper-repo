paperAbstract: In this paper, we will consider the approximation properties of a recently
  introduced neural network model called graph neural network (GNN), which can be
  used to process-structured data inputs, e.g., acyclic graphs, cyclic graphs, and
  directed or undirected graphs. This class of neural networks implements a function
  tau(G, n) isin R m that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n onto an m-dimensional
  Euclidean space. We characterize the functions that can be approximated by GNNs,
  in probability, up to any prescribed degree of precision. This set contains the
  maps that satisfy a property called preservation of the unfolding equivalence, and
  includes most of the practically useful functions on graphs; the only known exception
  is when the input graph contains particular patterns of symmetries when unfolding
  equivalence may not be preserved. The result can be considered an extension of the
  universal approximation property established for the classic feedforward neural
  networks (FNNs). Some experimental examples are used to show the computational capabilities
  of the proposed model.
