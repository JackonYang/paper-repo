paperAbstract: Understanding procedural language requires anticipating the causal
  effects of actions, even when they are not explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce
  Neural Process Networks to understand procedural text through (neural) simulation
  of action dynamics. Our model complements existing memory architectures with dynamic
  entity tracking by explicitly modeling actions as state transformers. The model
  updates the states of the entities by executing learned action operators. Empirical
  results demonstrate that our proposed model can reason about the unstated causal
  effects of actions, allowing it to provide more accurate contextual information
  for understanding and generating procedural text, all while offering more interpretable
  internal representations than existing alternatives.
