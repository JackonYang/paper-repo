paperAbstract: In online handwriting recognition the trajectory of the pen is recorded
  during writing. Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation
  of the written output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is
  spread over many pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated
  preprocessing techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these
  techniques require considerable human effort, and are specific to particular languages
  and alphabets. This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw
  online handwriting data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network
  with an output layer designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic
  language model. In experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent
  results using either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art
  HMM based system in both cases.
