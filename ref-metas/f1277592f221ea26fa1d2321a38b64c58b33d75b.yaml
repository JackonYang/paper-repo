paperAbstract: 'This completely revised second edition presents an introduction to
  statistical pattern recognition. Pattern recognition in general covers a wide range
  of problems: it is applied to engineering problems, such as character readers and
  wave form analysis as well as to brain modeling in biology and psychology. Statistical
  decision and estimation, which are the main subjects of this book, are regarded
  as fundamental to the study of pattern recognition. This book is appropriate as
  a text for introductory courses in pattern recognition and as a reference book for
  workers in the field. Each chapter contains computer projects as well as exercises.'
