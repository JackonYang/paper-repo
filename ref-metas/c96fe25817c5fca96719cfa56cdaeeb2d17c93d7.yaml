paperAbstract: "This is a description of research in developing a natural language\
  \ processing system with modular knowledge sources but strongly interactive processing.\
  \ The system offers insights into a variety of linguistic phenomena and allows easy\
  \ testing of a variety of hypotheses. Language interpretation takes place on a activation\
  \ network which is dynamically created from input, recent context, and long-term\
  \ knowledge. Initially ambiguous and unstable, the network settles on a single interpretation,\
  \ using a parallel, analog relaxation process. We also describe a parallel model\
  \ for the representation of context and of the priming of concepts. Examples illustrating\
  \ contextual influence on meaning interpretation and \u201Csemantic garden path\u201D\
  \ sentence processing, among other issues, are included."
