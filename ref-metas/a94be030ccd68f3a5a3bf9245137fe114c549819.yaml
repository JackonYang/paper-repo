paperAbstract: "The travelling salesman problem1 is a classical problem in the field\
  \ of combinatorial optimization, concerned with efficient methods for maximizing\
  \ or minimizing a function of many independent variables. Given the positions of\
  \ N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed\
  \ tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue\
  \ algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically\
  \ ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman\
  \ problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually\
  \ elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the\
  \ cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent\
  \ parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is\
  \ naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic\
  \ mappings between geometrical structures14."
