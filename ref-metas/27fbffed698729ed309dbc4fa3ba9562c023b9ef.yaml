paperAbstract: An end-to-end real-time text localization and recognition method is
  presented. Its real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection
  and segmentation problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal
  Regions. The ER detector is robust against blur, low contrast and illumination,
  color and texture variation. In the first stage, the probability of each ER being
  a character is estimated using features calculated by a novel algorithm in constant
  time and only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage,
  where the classification accuracy is improved using computationally more expensive
  features. A highly efficient clustering algorithm then groups ERs into text lines
  and an OCR classifier trained on synthetic fonts is exploited to label character
  regions. The most probable character sequence is selected in the last stage when
  the context of each character is known. The method was evaluated on three public
  datasets. On the ICDAR 2013 dataset the method achieves state-of-the-art results
  in text localization; on the more challenging SVT dataset, the proposed method significantly
  outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that the proposed pipeline
  can incorporate additional prior knowledge about the detected text. The proposed
  method was exploited as the baseline in the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading competition,
  where it compares favourably to the state-of-the art.
