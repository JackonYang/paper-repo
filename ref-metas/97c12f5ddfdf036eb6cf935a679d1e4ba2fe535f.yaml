paperAbstract: We formulate several problems in early vision as inverse problems.
  Among the solution methods we review standard regularization theory, discuss its
  limitations, and present new stochastic (in particular, Bayesian) techniques based
  on Markov Random Field models for their solution. We derive efficient algorithms
  and describe parallel implementations on digital parallel SIMD architectures, as
  well as a new class of parallel hybrid computers that mix digital with analog components.
