paperAbstract: In this paper we investigate the exact shape distribution for general
  Gaussian labelled point configurations in two dimensions. The shape density is written
  in a closed form, in terms of Kendall's or Bookstein's shape variables. The distribution
  simplifies considerably in certain cases, including the complex normal, isotropic,
  circular Markov and equal means cases. Various asymptotic properties of the distribution
  are investigated, including a large variation distribution and the normal approximation
  for small variations. The triangle case is considered in particular detail, and
  we compare the density with simulated densities for some examples. Finally, we consider
  inference problems, with an application in biology.
