paperAbstract: "Continuous speech was treated as if produced by a finite\u2010state\
  \ machine making a transition every centisecond. The observable output from state\
  \ transitions was considered to be a power spectrum\u2014a probabilistic function\
  \ of the target state of each transition. Using this model, observed sequences of\
  \ power spectra from real speech were decoded as sequences of acoustic states by\
  \ means of the Viterbi trellis algorithm. The finite\u2010state machine used as\
  \ a representation of the speech source was composed of machines representing words,\
  \ combined according to a \u201Clanguage model.\u201D When trained to the voice\
  \ of a particular speaker, the decoder recognized seven\u2010digit telephone numbers\
  \ correctly 96% of the time, with a better than 99% per\u2010digit accuracy. Results\
  \ for other tests of the system, including syllable and phoneme recognition, will\
  \ also be given."
