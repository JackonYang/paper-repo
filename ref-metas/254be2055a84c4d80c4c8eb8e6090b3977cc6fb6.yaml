paperAbstract: 'Many computer vision problems can be considered to consist of two
  main tasks: the extraction of image content descriptions and their subsequent matching.
  The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent,
  yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers
  in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the
  use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three
  inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description.
  In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that
  these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale
  algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its
  application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image
  retrieval is demonstrated.'
