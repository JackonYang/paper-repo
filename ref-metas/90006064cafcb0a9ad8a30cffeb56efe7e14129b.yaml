paperAbstract: "however (for it was the literal soul of the life of the Redeemer,\
  \ John xv. io), is the peculiar token of fellowship with the Redeemer. That love\
  \ to God (what is meant here is not God\u2019s love to men) is described in such\
  \ a case as a perfect love (love that has been perfected), involves no difficulty,\
  \ for the simple reason that the proposition is purely hypothetical. We must, of\
  \ course, also take the &dquo;keeping&dquo; in all its stringency. John knows right\
  \ well that the case supposed here ncver becomes full reality. &dquo; Hereb)\u2019\
  ,&dquo; i.e. from the actual realization of love to God. &dquo; TIli7i 7e)e are\
  \ ill Hinz &dquo;"
