paperAbstract: 'We demonstrate a multiscale pedestrian detector operating in near
  real time ( 6 fps on 640x480 images) with state-of-the-art detection performance.
  The computational bottleneck of many modern detectors is the construction of an
  image pyramid, typically sampled at 8-16 scales per octave, and associated feature
  computations at each scale. We propose a technique to avoid constructing such a
  finely sampled image pyramid without sacrificing performance: our key insight is
  that for a broad family of features, including gradient histograms, the feature
  responses computed at a single scale can be used to approximate feature responses
  at nearby scales. The approximation is accurate within an entire scale octave. This
  allows us to decouple the sampling of the image pyramid from the sampling of detection
  scales. Overall, our approximation yields a speedup of 10-100 times over competing
  methods with only a minor loss in detection accuracy of about 1-2% on the Caltech
  Pedestrian dataset across a wide range of evaluation settings. The results are confirmed
  on three additional datasets (INRIA, ETH, and TUD-Brussels) where our method always
  scores within a few percent of the state-of-the-art while being 1-2 orders of magnitude
  faster. The approach is general and should be widely applicable.'
