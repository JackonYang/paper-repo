paperAbstract: 'Table understanding is a well studied problem in document analysis,
  and many academic and commercial approaches have been developed to recognize tables
  in several document formats, including plain text, scanned page images and born-digital,
  object-based formats such as PDF. Despite the abundance of these techniques, an
  objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition
  held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating
  these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input
  formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location,
  (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received
  results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial
  products. This paper presents our findings.'
