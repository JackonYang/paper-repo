paperAbstract: The latest generation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved
  impressive results in challenging benchmarks on image recognition and object detection,
  significantly raising the interest of the community in these methods. Nevertheless,
  it is still unclear how different CNN methods compare with each other and with previous
  state-of-the-art shallow representations such as the Bag-of-Visual-Words and the
  Improved Fisher Vector. This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques,
  exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying
  and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties
  of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the
  CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on
  performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully
  shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied
  to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous
  performance boost. Source code and models to reproduce the experiments in the paper
  is made publicly available.
