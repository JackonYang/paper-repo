paperAbstract: This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for recognizing
  synonyms, based on statistical data acquired by querying a Web search engine. The
  algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information
  Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically
  evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign
  Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students
  of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score
  of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves
  a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications
  of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results
  for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).
