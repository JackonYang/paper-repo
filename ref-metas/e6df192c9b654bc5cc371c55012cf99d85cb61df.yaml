paperAbstract: Learning fine-grained image similarity is a challenging task. It needs
  to capture between-class and within-class image differences. This paper proposes
  a deep ranking model that employs deep learning techniques to learn similarity metric
  directly from images. It has higher learning capability than models based on hand-crafted
  features. A novel multiscale network structure has been developed to describe the
  images effectively. An efficient triplet sampling algorithm is also proposed to
  learn the model with distributed asynchronized stochastic gradient. Extensive experiments
  show that the proposed algorithm outperforms models based on hand-crafted visual
  features and deep classification models.
