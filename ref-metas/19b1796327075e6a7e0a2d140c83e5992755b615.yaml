paperAbstract: We address the knowledge representation for understanding table-form
  documents. In particular, we focus on the knowledge for establishing the correctness
  of recognized results in addition to the traditional syntactic/constructive-oriented
  understanding framework. In order to attain to this subject, we introduce the semantic
  information to specify domains and relationships among individual items definitely,
  which is complementary to the syntactic/constructive information available in the
  traditional framework.
