paperAbstract: Developed only recently, support vector learning machines achieve high
  generalization ability by minimizing a bound on the expected test error; however,
  so far there existed no way of adding knowledge about invariances of a classification
  problem at hand. We present a method of incorporating prior knowledge about transformation
  invariances by applying transformations to support vectors, the training examples
  most critical for determining the classification boundary.
