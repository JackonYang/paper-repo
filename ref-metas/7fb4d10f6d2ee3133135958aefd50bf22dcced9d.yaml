paperAbstract: 'Time is at the heart of many pattern recognition tasks (e.g., speech
  recognition). However, connectionist learning algorithms to date are not well-suited
  for dealing with time-varying input patterns. This chapter introduces a specialized
  connectionist architecture and corresponding specialization of the back-propagation
  learning algorithm that operates efficiently, both in computational time and space
  requirements, on temporal sequences. The key feature of the architecture is a layer
  of selfconnected hidden units that integrate their current value with the new input
  at each time step to construct a static representation of the temporal input sequence.
  This architecture avoids two deficiencies found in the back-propagation unfolding-intime
  procedure (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) for handing sequence recognition
  tasks: first, it reduces the difficulty of temporal credit assignment by focusing
  the back-propagated error signal; second, it eliminates the need for a buffer to
  hold the input sequence and/or intermediate activity levels. The latter property
  is due to the fact that during the forward (activation) phase, incremental activity
  traces can be locally computed that hold all information necessary for back propagation
  in time. It is argued that this architecture should scale better than conventional
  recurrent architectures with respect to sequence length. The architecture has been
  used to implement a temporal version of Rumelhart and McClelland''s (1986) verb
  past-tense model. The hidden units learn to behave something like Rumelhart and
  McClelland''s "Wickelphones," a rich and flexible representation of temporal information.'
