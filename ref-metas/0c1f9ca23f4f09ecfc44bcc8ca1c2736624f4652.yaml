paperAbstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent
  developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their
  tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers.
  Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer
  a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This
  grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of
  the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models.
  We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU
  models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new
  approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves
  on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank
  (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning.
