paperAbstract: The Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) is a probabilistic
  model for sequences that is able to successfully model (i.e., generate nice-looking
  samples of) several very high dimensional sequences, such as motion capture data
  and the pixels of low resolution videos of balls bouncing in a box. The major disadvantage
  of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs
  update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difficulty
  has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was
  accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent
  TRBM, which is a very slight modification of the TRBM for which exact inference
  is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable. We demonstrate that
  the RTRBM is better than an analogous TRBM at generating motion capture and videos
  of bouncing balls.
