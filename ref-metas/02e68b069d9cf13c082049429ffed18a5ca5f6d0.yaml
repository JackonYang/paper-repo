paperAbstract: This paper presents two new formulations of multiple-instance learning
  as a maximum margin problem. The proposed extensions of the Support Vector Machine
  (SVM) learning approach lead to mixed integer quadratic programs that can be solved
  heuristic ally. Our generalization of SVMs makes a state-of-the-art classification
  technique, including non-linear classification via kernels, available to an area
  that up to now has been largely dominated by special purpose methods. We present
  experimental results on a pharmaceutical data set and on applications in automated
  image indexing and document categorization.
