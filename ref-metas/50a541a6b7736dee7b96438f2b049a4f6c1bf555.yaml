paperAbstract: "How well can human faces be identified by humans and by computers,\
  \ using subjectively judged \"feature\" descriptions like long ears, wide-set eyes,\
  \ etc.? Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment\
  \ of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human\
  \ identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger\
  \ set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can\
  \ be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits\
  \ of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using\
  \ feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately\
  \ 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of\
  \ 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred\
  \ with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population\
  \ of 4\xD7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation\
  \ for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification\
  \ and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."
