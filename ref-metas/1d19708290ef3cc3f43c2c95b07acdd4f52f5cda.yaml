paperAbstract: "Speech research has made tremendous progress in the past using the\
  \ following paradigm:\u2022 define the research problem,\u2022 collect a corpus\
  \ to objectively measure progress, and\u2022 solve the research problem.Natural\
  \ language research, on the other hand, has typically progressed without the benefit\
  \ of any corpus of data with which to test research hypotheses. We describe the\
  \ Air Travel Information System (ATIS) pilot corpus, a corpus designed to measure\
  \ progress in Spoken Language Systems that include both a speech and natural language\
  \ component. This pilot marks the first full-scale attempt to collect such a corpus\
  \ and provides guidelines for future efforts."
