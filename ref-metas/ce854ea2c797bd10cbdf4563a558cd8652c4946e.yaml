paperAbstract: 'The goal of this paper is to discover a set of discriminative patches
  which can serve as a fully unsupervised mid-level visual representation. The desired
  patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to
  occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need
  to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond
  to parts, objects, "visual phrases", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of
  them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge
  dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between
  clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation
  at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness
  of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting
  that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative
  patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where
  they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset.'
