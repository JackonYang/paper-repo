paperAbstract: A new and robust multi-resolution approach of localizing and segmenting
  text in videos is proposed. The approach has been tested extensively on a large
  variety of video frame sizes such 352/spl times/240 up to 1920/spl times/1280 and
  a large representative set of video sequences such as home videos, newscasts, title
  sequences and commercials. 95% of the text bounding boxes in videos were localized
  correctly. 80% of all characters were segmented correctly, while 7.8% characters
  were damaged. 90% of the correctly segmented characters were recognized correctly
  by standard OCR software.
