paperAbstract: 'Although color is commonly experienced as an indispensable quality
  in describing the world around us, state-of-the art local feature-based representations
  arc mostly based on shape description, and ignore color information. The description
  of color is hampered by the large amount of variations which causes the measured
  color values to vary significantly. In this paper we aim to extend the description
  of local features with color information. To accomplish a wide applicability of
  the color descriptor, it should be robust to: 1. photometric changes commonly encountered
  in the real world, 2. varying image quality; from high quality images to snap-shot
  photo quality and compressed internet images. Based on these requirements we derive
  a set of color descriptors. The set of proposed descriptors are compared by extensive
  testing on multiple applications areas, namely, matching, retrieval and classification,
  and on a wide variety of image qualities. The results show that color descriptors
  remain reliable under photometric and geometrical changes, and with decreasing image
  quality. For all experiments a combination of color and shape outperforms a pure
  shape-based approach.'
