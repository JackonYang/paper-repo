paperAbstract: We present an integrated framework for using Convolutional Networks
  for classification, localization and detection. We show how a multiscale and sliding
  window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce
  a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries.
  Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase
  detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously
  using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization
  task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013)
  and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.
  In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection
  task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat.
