paperAbstract: Three standard approaches to automatic texture classification make
  use of features based on the Fourier power spectrum, on second-order gray level
  statistics, and on first-order statistics of gray level differences, respectively.
  Feature sets of these types, all designed analogously, were used to classify two
  sets of terrain samples. It was found that the Fourier features generally performed
  more poorly, while the other feature sets all performned comparably.
