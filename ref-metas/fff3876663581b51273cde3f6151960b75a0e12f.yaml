paperAbstract: We introduce Peekaboom, an entertaining web-based game that can help
  computers locate objects in images. People play the game because of its entertainment
  value, and as a side effect of them playing, we collect valuable image metadata,
  such as which pixels belong to which object in the image. The collected data could
  be applied towards constructing more accurate computer vision algorithms, which
  require massive amounts of training and testing data not currently available. Peekaboom
  has been played by thousands of people, some of whom have spent over 12 hours a
  day playing, and thus far has generated millions of data points. In addition to
  its purely utilitarian aspect, Peekaboom is an example of a new, emerging class
  of games, which not only bring people together for leisure purposes, but also exist
  to improve artificial intelligence. Such games appeal to a general audience, while
  providing answers to problems that computers cannot yet solve.
