paperAbstract: The speech recognition problem hidden Markov models the acoustic model
  basic language modelling the Viterbi search hypothesis search on a tree and the
  fast match elements of information theory the complexity of tasks - the quality
  of language models the expectation - maximization algorithm and its consequences
  decision trees and tree language models phonetics from orthography - spelling-to-base
  from mappings triphones and allophones maximum entropy probability estimation and
  language models three applications of maximum entropy estimation to language modelling
  estimation of probabilities from counts and the Back-Off method.
