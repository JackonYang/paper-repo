paperAbstract: 'This paper develops a new approach for extremely fast detection in
  domains where the distribution of positive and negative examples is highly skewed
  (e.g. face detection or database retrieval). In such domains a cascade of simple
  classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive
  rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection
  rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely
  high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by
  machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism
  for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in
  the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements
  in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process
  15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of
  1 in a 1,000,000.'
