paperAbstract: We introduce a method of adapting neural paragraph-level question answering
  models to the case where entire documents are given as input. Most current question
  answering models cannot scale to document or multi-document input, and naively applying
  these models to each paragraph independently often results in them being distracted
  by irrelevant text. We show that it is possible to significantly improve performance
  by using a modified training scheme that teaches the model to ignore non-answer
  containing paragraphs. Our method involves sampling multiple paragraphs from each
  document, and using an objective function that requires the model to produce globally
  correct output. We additionally identify and improve upon a number of other design
  decisions that arise when working with document-level data. Experiments on TriviaQA
  and SQuAD shows our method advances the state of the art, including a 10 point gain
  on TriviaQA.
