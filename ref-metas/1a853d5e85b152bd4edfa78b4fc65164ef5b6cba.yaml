paperAbstract: 'High level semantics embodied in scene texts are both rich and clear
  and thus can serve as important cues for a wide range of vision applications, for
  instance, image understanding, image indexing, video search, geolocation and automatic
  navigation. In this paper, we present a unified framework for text detection and
  recognition in natural images. The contributions of this work are three-fold: (1)
  Text detection and recognition are accomplished concurrently using exactly the same
  features and classification scheme. (2) In contrast to methods in the literature,
  which mainly focus on horizontal or near-horizontal texts, the proposed system is
  capable of localizing and reading texts of varying orientations. (3) A new dictionary
  search method is proposed, to correct the recognition errors usually caused by confusions
  among similar yet different characters. As an additional contribution, a novel image
  database with texts of different scales, colors, fonts and orientations in diverse
  realworld scenarios, is generated and released. Extensive experiments on standard
  benchmarks as well as the proposed database demonstrate that the proposed system
  achieves highly competitive performance, especially on multi-oriented texts.'
