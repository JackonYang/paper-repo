paperAbstract: "AbstractWe will show in this paper one of the numerous interests of\
  \ designing a generic recognition system, i.e. the possibility of producing either\
  \ general or specific systems. We propose the Description and Modification of Segmentation\
  \ (DMOS) method, which is made of a new grammatical language (Enhanced Position\
  \ Formalism\u2014EPF) and an associated parser able to deal with noise. From an\
  \ EPF description of a kind of document structure, a new recognition system is produced\
  \ by compilation. This method has been successfully used to produce recognition\
  \ systems on musical scores, mathematical formulae and even tennis courts in videos.\
  \ This DMOS generic method separates knowledge from program. Therefore, for a same\
  \ kind of document like table structures, it is possible to define with EPF, more\
  \ or less specific descriptions to produce more or less specific recognition systems.\
  \ For example, we have been able to produce a general recognition system of table\
  \ structures. It can recognize the hierarchical organization \nof a table made with\
  \ rulings, whatever the number/size of column/rows and the deep of the hierarchy\
  \ contents in it, as soon as the document has a not too bad quality (no missing\
  \ rulings for example). We will present the way the description is done using EPF\
  \ to be general enough to recognize very different table organizations. With the\
  \ same DMOS generic method, we have also been able to easily define a specific recognition\
  \ system of the table structure of quite damaged military forms of the 19th century.\
  \ This specific description was necessary to compensate some missing informations\
  \ concerning the table structure of those military forms, due to a very bad quality\
  \ or hidden part of the table. This system has been successfully validated on 88,745\
  \ images, showing that this DMOS generic method can be used at an industrial level."
