paperAbstract: "For many computer vision problems, the most time consuming component\
  \ consists of nearest neighbor matching in high-dimensional spaces. There are no\
  \ known exact algorithms for solving these high-dimensional problems that are faster\
  \ than linear search. Approximate algorithms are known to provide large speedups\
  \ with only minor loss in accuracy, but many such algorithms have been published\
  \ with only minimal guidance on selecting an algorithm and its parameters for any\
  \ given problem. In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question,\
  \ \u201CWhat is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?\u201D\
  \ Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use\
  \ these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also\
  \ describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means\
  \ trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets.\
  \ After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized\
  \ k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public\
  \ domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one\
  \ order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available\
  \ software and provides fully automated parameter selection."
