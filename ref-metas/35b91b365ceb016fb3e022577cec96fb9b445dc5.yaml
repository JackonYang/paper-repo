paperAbstract: 'We introduce a new test of how well language models capture meaning
  in children''s books. Unlike standard language modelling benchmarks, it distinguishes
  the task of predicting syntactic function words from that of predicting lower-frequency
  words, which carry greater semantic content. We compare a range of state-of-the-art
  models, each with a different way of encoding what has been previously read. We
  show that models which store explicit representations of long-term contexts outperform
  state-of-the-art neural language models at predicting semantic content words, although
  this advantage is not observed for syntactic function words. Interestingly, we find
  that the amount of text encoded in a single memory representation is highly influential
  to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not too big and not too small, between
  single words and full sentences that allows the most meaningful information in a
  text to be effectively retained and recalled. Further, the attention over such window-based
  memories can be trained effectively through self-supervision. We then assess the
  generality of this principle by applying it to the CNN QA benchmark, which involves
  identifying named entities in paraphrased summaries of news articles, and achieve
  state-of-the-art performance.'
