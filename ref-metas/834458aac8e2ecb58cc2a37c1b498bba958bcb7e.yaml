paperAbstract: The recognition of raised alphanumeric markings on rubber tires for
  their automatic classification is presented. Raised alphanumeric markings on rubber
  tires show different characteristics from those of printed characters. In the preprocessing
  step of the proposed method, we first determine the slope of an arc, along which
  alphanumerics are marked, using the Hough transform, and align them horizontally.
  Then we separate each character using vertical and horizontal projections. In the
  recognition step, to recognize characters hierarchically we use several effective
  features, such as width of a character, number of cross points, partial projections,
  and distance features. Computer simulation results show that the proposed system
  can be successfully applied to automatic classification of rubber tires.
