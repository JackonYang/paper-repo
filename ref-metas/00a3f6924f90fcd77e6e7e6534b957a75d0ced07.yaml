paperAbstract: 'We present YAGO, a light-weight and extensible ontology with high
  coverage and quality. YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains
  more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy
  as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts
  have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using
  a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in
  this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality
  by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc.
  with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of
  facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness
  shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which
  is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can
  be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.'
