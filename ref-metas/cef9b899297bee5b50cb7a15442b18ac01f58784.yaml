paperAbstract: Flexible models of object classes, based on linear combinations of
  prototypical images, are capable of matching novel images of the same class and
  have been shown to be a powerful tool to solve several fundamental vision tasks
  such as recognition, synthesis and correspondence. The key problem in creating a
  specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the
  prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe
  an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes.
  The algorithm -which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models-is shown
  to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible
  model of handwritten digits.
