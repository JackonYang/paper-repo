paperAbstract: In this paper, we describe some of the interactions between layout
  and language we have been dealing with in recent applied NLP projects. We present
  two complementary views of lists and tables, intended to bridge the gap between
  considering them as a type of running text (which linguistics knows how to deal
  with) and as a multi-dimensional relation represented in two dimensions, which may
  have many reading-paths (which linguistics doesn't know how to deal with). Stated
  or inferred linguistic and world knowledge in the text surrounding tables and lists
  provides a context for the interpretation of a set of tuples extracted from tables
  or lists together with heuristics about how multi-dimensional information is projected
  on to two dimensions.
