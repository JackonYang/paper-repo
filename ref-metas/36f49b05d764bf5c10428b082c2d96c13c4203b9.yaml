paperAbstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm that can achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on a variety of machine learning tasks. Several researchers
  have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performance-destroying
  memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical
  analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any
  locking. We present an update scheme called HOGWILD! which allows processors access
  to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show
  that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates
  only modify small parts of the decision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly
  optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms
  alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude.
