paperAbstract: Many museum and library archives are digitizing their large collections
  of handwritten historical manuscripts to enable public access to them. These collections
  are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work
  for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess
  of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical
  models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text
  query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution
  between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models
  can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text
  query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test
  set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments
  show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical
  manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus.
