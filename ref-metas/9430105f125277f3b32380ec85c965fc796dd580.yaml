paperAbstract: Abstract A set of hypotheses is formulated for a connectionist approach
  to cognitive modeling. These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses
  underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are
  massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous
  dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically
  to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe
  the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic
  cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like
  those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by
  symbolic models. Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle
  relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes
  are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level
  as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character
  of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher
  level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will
  typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting
  hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which
  traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide
  an understanding of cognition.
