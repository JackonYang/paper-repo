paperAbstract: When we look at a picture, our prior knowledge about the world allows
  us to resolve some of the ambiguities that are inherent to monocular vision, and
  thereby infer 3d information about the scene. We also recognize different objects,
  decide on their orientations, and identify how they are connected to their environment.
  Focusing on the problem of autonomous 3d reconstruction of indoor scenes, in this
  paper we present a dynamic Bayesian network model capable of resolving some of these
  ambiguities and recovering 3d information for many images. Our model assumes a "floorwall"
  geometry on the scene and is trained to recognize the floor-wall boundary in each
  column of the image. When the image is produced under perspective geometry, we show
  that this model can be used for 3d reconstruction from a single image. To our knowledge,
  this was the first monocular approach to automatically recover 3d reconstructions
  from single indoor images.
