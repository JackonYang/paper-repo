paperAbstract: A non-parametric method for texture synthesis is proposed. The texture
  synthesis process grows a new image outward from an initial seed, one pixel at a
  time. A Markov random field model is assumed, and the conditional distribution of
  a pixel given all its neighbors synthesized so far is estimated by querying the
  sample image and finding all similar neighborhoods. The degree of randomness is
  controlled by a single perceptually intuitive parameter. The method aims at preserving
  as much local structure as possible and produces good results for a wide variety
  of synthetic and real-world textures.
