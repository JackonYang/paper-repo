paperAbstract: Image segmentation is not only hard and unnecessary for texture-based
  image retrieval, but can even be harmful. Images of either individual or multiple
  textures are best described by distributions of spatial frequency descriptors, rather
  than single descriptor vectors over presegmented regions. A retrieval method based
  on the earth movers distance with an appropriate ground distance is shown to handle
  both complete and partial multi-textured queries. As an illustration, different
  images of the same type of animal are easily retrieved together. At the same time,
  animals with subtly different coats, like cheetahs and leopards, are properly distinguished.
