paperAbstract: Parameter-specific adaptive learning rate methods are computationally
  efficient ways to reduce the ill-conditioning problems encountered when training
  large deep networks. Following recent work that strongly suggests that most of the
  critical points encountered when training such networks are saddle points, we find
  how considering the presence of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian could help us
  design better suited adaptive learning rate schemes. We show that the popular Jacobi
  preconditioner has undesirable behavior in the presence of both positive and negative
  curvature, and present theoretical and empirical evidence that the so-called equilibration
  preconditioner is comparatively better suited to non-convex problems. We introduce
  a novel adaptive learning rate scheme, called ESGD, based on the equilibration preconditioner.
  Our experiments show that ESGD performs as well or better than RMSProp in terms
  of convergence speed, always clearly improving over plain stochastic gradient descent.
