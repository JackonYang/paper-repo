paperAbstract: An application of back-propagation networks to handwritten zip code
  recognition is presented. Minimal preprocessing of the data is required, but the
  architecture of the network is highly constrained and specifically designed for
  the task. The input of the network consists of size-normalized images of isolated
  digits. The performance on zip code digits provided by the US Postal Service is
  92% recognition, 1% substitution, and 7% rejects. Structured neural networks can
  be viewed as statistical methods with structure which bridge the gap between purely
  statistical and purely structural methods.<<ETX>>
