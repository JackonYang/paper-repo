paperAbstract: Information Extraction (IE) for semi-structured document images is
  often approached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input
  token into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,
  such problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily handle
  complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly structured information,
  which are nevertheless frequently observed in real-world document images. To tackle
  these issues, we first formulate the IE task as spatial dependency parsing problem
  that focuses on the relationship among text segment nodes in the documents. Under
  this setup, we then propose SPADE (SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly
  complex spatial relationships and an arbitrary number of information layers in the
  documents in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents
  such as receipts, name cards, forms, and invoices, and show that it achieves a similar
  or better performance compared to strong baselines including BERT-based IOB taggger,
  with up to 37.7% improvement.
