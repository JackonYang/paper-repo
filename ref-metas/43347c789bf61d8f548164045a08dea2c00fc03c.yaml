paperAbstract: 'In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for recognizing the
  grid structure within a tabular document. The algorithm has two parts: first a row
  labeling algorithm groups similar rows into clusters then, a column labeling algorithm
  identifies the column structure within each cluster. Each column structure is identified
  by a set of column separation intervals that are computed from the intervals representing
  the extent of the white spacing between consecutive word fragments. We formally
  describe a method for finding column separation intervals based on word fragment
  separation intervals. This method is based on constructing a closure of a set of
  line intervals under the operation of line intersection. The closure is maintained
  dynamically in a data structure which facilitates easy access to the elements within
  the closure. This technique is computationally less expensive than projection and
  search at the pixel level since word fragment acquisition is already required for
  document recognition applications.'
