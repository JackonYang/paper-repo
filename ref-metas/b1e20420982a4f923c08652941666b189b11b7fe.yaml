paperAbstract: Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer
  comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor impeding
  its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of human-annotated
  data. Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by creating over a million
  training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news articles with their summarized
  bullet points, and show that a neural network can then be trained to give good performance
  on this task. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of this new reading
  comprehension task. Our primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding
  is required to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful
  hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing that
  simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and 76.6% on these
  two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by 7-10% and approaching
  what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this task.
