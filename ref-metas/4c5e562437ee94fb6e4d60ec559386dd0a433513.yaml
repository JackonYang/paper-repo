paperAbstract: A single linear programming formulation is proposed which generates
  a plane that of minimizes an average sum of misclassified points belonging to two
  disjoint points sets in n-dimensional real space. When the convex hulls of the two
  sets are also disjoint, the plane completely separates the two sets. When the convex
  hulls intersect, our linear program, unlike all previously proposed linear programs,
  is guaranteed to generate some error-minimizing plane, without the imposition of
  extraneous normalization constraints that inevitably fail to handle certain cases.
  The effectiveness of the proposed linear program has been demonstrated by successfully
  testing it on a number of databases. In addition, it has been used in conjunction
  with the multisurface method of piecewise-linear separation to train a feed-forward
  neural network with a single hidden layer.
