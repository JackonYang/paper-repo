paperAbstract: We describe a series of five statistical models of the translation
  process and give algorithms for estimating the parameters of these models given
  a set of pairs of sentences that are translations of one another. We define a concept
  of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of
  such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible
  word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these
  alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts
  well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great
  deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament.
  Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that
  because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other
  pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content
  of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are
  inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus.
