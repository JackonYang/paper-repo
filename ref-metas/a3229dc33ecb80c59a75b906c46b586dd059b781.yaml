paperAbstract: Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent
  measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity
  has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical
  flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness
  pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation
  is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic
  image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that
  are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization
  of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption
  of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.
