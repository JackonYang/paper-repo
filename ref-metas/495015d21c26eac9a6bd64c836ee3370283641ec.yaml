paperAbstract: How can we know whether a statement about our world is valid. For example,
  given a relationship between a pair of entities e.g., `eat(horse, hay)', how can
  we know whether this relationship is true or false in general. Gathering such knowledge
  about entities and their relationships is one of the fundamental challenges in knowledge
  extraction. Most previous works on knowledge extraction have focused purely on text-driven
  reasoning for verifying relation phrases. In this work, we introduce the problem
  of visual verification of relation phrases and developed a Visual Knowledge Extraction
  system called VisKE. Given a verb-based relation phrase between common nouns, our
  approach assess its validity by jointly analyzing over text and images and reasoning
  about the spatial consistency of the relative configurations of the entities and
  the relation involved. Our approach involves no explicit human supervision thereby
  enabling large-scale analysis. Using our approach, we have already verified over
  12000 relation phrases. Our approach has been used to not only enrich existing textual
  knowledge bases by improving their recall, but also augment open-domain question-answer
  reasoning.
