paperAbstract: We describe a technique for image encoding in which local operators
  of many scales but identical shape serve as the basis functions. The representation
  differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial
  frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by
  subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result
  is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance
  and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density.
  Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps
  are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately
  expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent
  to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends
  to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that
  it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression.
  Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding.
