paperAbstract: "We consider the problem of learning general-purpose, paraphrastic\
  \ sentence embeddings based on supervision from the Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch\
  \ et al., 2013). We compare six compositional architectures, evaluating them on\
  \ annotated textual similarity datasets drawn both from the same distribution as\
  \ the training data and from a wide range of other domains. We find that the most\
  \ complex architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural\
  \ networks, perform best on the in-domain data. However, in out-of-domain scenarios,\
  \ simple architectures such as word averaging vastly outperform LSTMs. Our simplest\
  \ averaging model is even competitive with systems tuned for the particular tasks\
  \ while also being extremely efficient and easy to use. \nIn order to better understand\
  \ how these architectures compare, we conduct further experiments on three supervised\
  \ NLP tasks: sentence similarity, entailment, and sentiment classification. We again\
  \ find that the word averaging models perform well for sentence similarity and entailment,\
  \ outperforming LSTMs. However, on sentiment classification, we find that the LSTM\
  \ performs very strongly-even recording new state-of-the-art performance on the\
  \ Stanford Sentiment Treebank. \nWe then demonstrate how to combine our pretrained\
  \ sentence embeddings with these supervised tasks, using them both as a prior and\
  \ as a black box feature extractor. This leads to performance rivaling the state\
  \ of the art on the SICK similarity and entailment tasks. We release all of our\
  \ resources to the research community with the hope that they can serve as the new\
  \ baseline for further work on universal sentence embeddings."
