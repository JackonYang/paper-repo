paperAbstract: We propose a detection and segmentation algorithm for the purposes
  of fine-grained recognition. The algorithm first detects low-level regions that
  could potentially belong to the object and then performs a full-object segmentation
  through propagation. Apart from segmenting the object, we can also `zoom in' on
  the object, i.e. center it, normalize it for scale, and thus discount the effects
  of the background. We then show that combining this with a state-of-the-art classification
  algorithm leads to significant improvements in performance especially for datasets
  which are considered particularly hard for recognition, e.g. birds species. The
  proposed algorithm is much more efficient than other known methods in similar scenarios.
  Our method is also simpler and we apply it here to different classes of objects,
  e.g. birds, flowers, cats and dogs. We tested the algorithm on a number of benchmark
  datasets for fine-grained categorization. It outperforms all the known state-of-the-art
  methods on these datasets, sometimes by as much as 11%. It improves the performance
  of our baseline algorithm by 3-4%, consistently on all datasets. We also observed
  more than a 4% improvement in the recognition performance on a challenging large-scale
  flower dataset, containing 578 species of flowers and 250,000 images.
