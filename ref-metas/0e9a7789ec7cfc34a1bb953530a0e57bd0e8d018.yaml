paperAbstract: "The following is a fundamental reading list for doctoral candidates\
  \ to use as a guide in preparing for their comprehensive examination in the field\
  \ of Modernism. A student is expected to have read widely in the field; to be thoroughly\
  \ familiar with the major writers; and to read widely in the journal literature.\
  \ The following reading list is suggestive rather than definitive, a list for the\
  \ student and Committee on Studies to begin with. The list has four sections: \u2022\
  \ Poetry \u2022 Drama \u2022 Fiction \u2022 Secondary Sources"
