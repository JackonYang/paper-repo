paperAbstract: 'AbstractThe systems currently available for contentbased image and

  video retrieval work without semantic knowledge, i. e. they use

  image processing methods to extract low level features of the

  data. The similarity obtained by these approaches does not

  always correspond to the similarity a human user would expect. A

  way to include more semantic knowledge into the indexing process

  is to use the text included in the images and video sequences.

  It is rich in information but easy to use, e. g. by key word

  based queries. In this paper we present an algorithm to localise

  artificial text in images and videos using a measure of

  accumulated gradients and morphological processing. The quality

  of the localised text is improved by robust multiple frame

  integration. A new technique for the binarisation of the text

  boxes based on a criterion maximizing local contrast is

  proposed. Finally, detection and OCR results for a commercial

  OCR are presented, justifying the choice of the binarisation

  technique.'
