paperAbstract: "Support Vector Machines (SVM\u2019s) are a relatively new learning\
  \ method used for binary classification. The basic idea is to find a hyperplane\
  \ which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However,\
  \ since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion\
  \ of a \u201Ckernel induced feature space\u201D which casts the data into a higher\
  \ dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a\
  \ space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight\
  \ used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be\
  \ dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in\
  \ that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension\
  \ (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019\
  s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks,\
  \ for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically\
  \ wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also\
  \ been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output\
  \ a numerical value, rather than \u201Cyes/no\u201D classification)."
