paperAbstract: Contours and junctions are important cues for perceptual organization
  and shape recognition. Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because
  the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge
  detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to
  junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the
  intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured
  regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection
  should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours
  themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this
  paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of
  local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date
  (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting
  contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour
  salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model
  lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state
  of the art performance.
