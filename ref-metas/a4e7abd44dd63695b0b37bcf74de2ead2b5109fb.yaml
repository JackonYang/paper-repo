paperAbstract: If a scene containing fine spatial detail is viewed at constant high
  photopic luminance, there are two main factors which limit the perception of the
  fine detail-the quality of the optics of the eye forming the image on the retina
  and the ability of the retina (coupled to the brain) to resolve the details of that
  image. In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving
  power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and
  spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements
  of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer
  & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is
  not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should
  be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper
  reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference
  fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy,
  1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be
  formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique
  is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which
  to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved
  by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference
  fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts
  on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving
  power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of
  the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings
  whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which
  were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing
  the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for
  sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the
  quality of the
