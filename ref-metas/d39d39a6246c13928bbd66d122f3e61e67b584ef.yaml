paperAbstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning a generative model
  of natural language sentences together with their formal meaning representations
  with hierarchical structures. The model is applied to the task of mapping sentences
  to hierarchical representations of their underlying meaning. We introduce dynamic
  programming techniques for efficient training and decoding. In experiments, we demonstrate
  that the model, when coupled with a discriminative reranking technique, achieves
  state-of-the-art performance when tested on two publicly available corpora. The
  generative model degrades robustly when presented with instances that are different
  from those seen in training. This allows a notable improvement in recall compared
  to previous models.
