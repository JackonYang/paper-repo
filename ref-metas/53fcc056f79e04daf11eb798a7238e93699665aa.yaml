paperAbstract: "This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines:\
  \ Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires\
  \ the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem.\
  \ SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems.\
  \ These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming\
  \ numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for\
  \ SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large\
  \ training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between\
  \ linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while\
  \ the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic\
  \ in the training set size. SMO\u2019s computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation,\
  \ hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On realworld sparse\
  \ data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm."
