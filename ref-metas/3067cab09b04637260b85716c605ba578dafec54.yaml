paperAbstract: 'Proving lower bounds on the amount of resources needed to compute
  specific functions is one of the most active branches of theoretical computer science.
  Significant progress has been made recently in proving lower bounds in two restricted
  models of Boolean circuits. One is the model of small depth circuits, and in this
  book Johan Torkel Hastad has developed very powerful techniques for proving exponential
  lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits'' computing functions.The techniques
  described in "Computational Limitations for Small Depth Circuits" can be used to
  demonstrate almost optimal lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits computing
  several different functions, such as parity and majority. The main tool used in
  the proof of the lower bounds is a lemma, stating that any AND of small fanout OR
  gates can be converted into an OR of small fanout AND gates with high probability
  when random values are substituted for the variables.Hastad also applies this tool
  to relativized complexity, and discusses in great detail the computation of parity
  and majority in small depth circuits.Contents: Introduction. Small Depth Circuits.
