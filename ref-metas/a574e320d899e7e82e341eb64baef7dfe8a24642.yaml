paperAbstract: This paper presents a statistical model which trains from a corpus
  annotated with Part Of Speech tags and assigns them to previously unseen text with
  state of the art accuracy The model can be classi ed as a Maximum Entropy model
  and simultaneously uses many contextual features to predict the POS tag Furthermore
  this paper demonstrates the use of specialized fea tures to model di cult tagging
  decisions discusses the corpus consistency problems discovered during the implementation
  of these features and proposes a training strategy that mitigates these problems
