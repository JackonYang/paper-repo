paperAbstract: The basic concepts and building blocks in multirate digital signal
  processing (DSP), including the digital polyphase representation, are reviewed.
  Recent progress, as reported by several authors in this area, is discussed. Several
  applications are described, including subband coding of waveforms, voice privacy
  systems, integral and fractional sampling rate conversion (such as in digital audio),
  digital crossover networks, and multirate coding of narrowband filter coefficients.
  The M-band quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank is discussed in considerable detail,
  including an analysis of various errors and imperfections. Recent techniques for
  perfect signal reconstruction in such systems are reviewed. The connection between
  QMF banks and other related topics, such as block digital filtering and periodically
  time-varying systems, is examined in a pseudo-circulant-matrix framework. Unconventional
  applications of the polyphase concept are discussed. >
