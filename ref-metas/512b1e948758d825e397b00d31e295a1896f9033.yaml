paperAbstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining local surface orientation
  from the intensity information contained in a single monocular view. It represents
  another look at the problem of obtaining shape from shading information. This problem
  was first formulated by as the solution of first-order non-linear partial differential
  equations. It was subsequently reformulated by to take advantage of the geometric
  insight provided by the gradient space approach popularized by and .
