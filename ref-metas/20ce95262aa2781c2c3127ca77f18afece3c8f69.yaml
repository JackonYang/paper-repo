paperAbstract: 'Provides a systematic account of the subject area, concentrating on
  the most recent advances in the field. While the focus is on practical considerations,
  both theoretical and practical issues are explored. Among the advances covered are:
  regularized discriminant analysis and bootstrap-based assessment of the performance
  of a sample-based discriminant rule and extensions of discriminant analysis motivated
  by problems in statistical image analysis. Includes over 1,200 references in the
  bibliography.'
