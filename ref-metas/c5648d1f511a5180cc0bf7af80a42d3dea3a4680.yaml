paperAbstract: The authors address the problem of automatically learning object models
  for recognition and pose estimation. In contrast to the traditional approach, they
  formulate the recognition problem as one of matching visual appearance rather than
  shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape,
  reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While
  shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties of an object and are constant, pose
  and illumination vary from scene to scene. They present a new compact representation
  of object appearance that is parameterized by pose and illumination. They have conducted
  experiments using several objects with complex appearance characteristics.<<ETX>>
