paperAbstract: "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely\
  \ used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information\
  \ about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable\u2014the hidden\
  \ state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into\
  \ multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner.\
  \ We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the\
  \ hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward\u2013\
  backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models.\
  \ Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact\
  \ algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference\
  \ can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational\
  \ framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables\
  \ are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the\
  \ model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and\
  \ provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured\
  \ approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture\
  \ statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot."
