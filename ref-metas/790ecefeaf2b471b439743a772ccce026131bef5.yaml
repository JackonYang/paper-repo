paperAbstract: We present a simple and effective semisupervised method for training
  dependency parsers. We focus on the problem of lexical representation, introducing
  features that incorporate word clusters derived from a large unannotated corpus.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a series of dependency parsing
  experiments on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, and we show that
  the cluster-based features yield substantial gains in performance across a wide
  range of conditions. For example, in the case of English unlabeled second-order
  parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 92.02% to 93.16%, and in the case
  of Czech unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of
  86.13% to 87.13%. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also improves performance
  when small amounts of training data are available, and can roughly halve the amount
  of supervised data required to reach a desired level of performance.
