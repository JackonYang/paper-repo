paperAbstract: 'The main purpose of this paper is to give techniques for analysing
  the probabilistic performance of certain kinds of algorithms, and hence to suggest
  some fast algorithms with provably desirable probabilistic behaviour. The particular
  problems we consider are: finding Hamiltonian circuits in directed graphs (DHC),
  finding Hamiltonian circuits in undirected graphs (UHC), and finding perfect matchings
  in undirected graphs (PM). We show that for each problem there is an algorithm that
  is extremely fast (0(n(log n)2) for DHC and UHC, and 0(nlog n) for PM), and which
  with probability tending to one finds a solution in randomly chosen graphs of sufficient
  density. These results contrast with the known NP-completeness of the first two
  problems [2,12] and the best worst-case upper bound known of 0(n2.5) for the last
  [9].'
