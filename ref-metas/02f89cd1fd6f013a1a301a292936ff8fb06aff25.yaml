paperAbstract: Two-dimensional spatial linear filters are constrained by general uncertainty
  relations that limit their attainable information resolution for orientation, spatial
  frequency, and two-dimensional (2D) spatial position. The theoretical lower limit
  for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal
  2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated
  bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization
  of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of
  communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with
  various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions,
  favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such
  filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum)
  in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D
  visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could
  subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented
  that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex
  are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual
  neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral
  information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation
  and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several
  underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal
  axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal
  volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
