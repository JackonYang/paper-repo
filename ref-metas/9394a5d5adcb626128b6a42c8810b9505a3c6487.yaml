paperAbstract: 'A snake is an energy-minimizing spline guided by external constraint
  forces and influenced by image forces that pull it toward features such as lines
  and edges. Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing
  them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region
  surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems,
  including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and
  stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation,
  in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.'
