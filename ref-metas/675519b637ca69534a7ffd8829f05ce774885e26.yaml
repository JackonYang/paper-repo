paperAbstract: Information retrieval of ASCLI documents generally refers to retrieval
  based on linear patterns found in the source documents. We have developed a method
  for recognizing and extracting tabular data, inthis case financial tables. Tables
  are extracted using a version of the LR(k) parsing algorithm adapted for this purpose.
  Because of sloppiness in the construction of tables, somewhat less than 100% of
  the tables can be retrieved automatically; a method has been found to integrate
  the parsing algorithm into amodule analogous to a programming language debugger
  that allows operators to quickly correct defects in the source document. This paper
  describes an application in commercial use.
