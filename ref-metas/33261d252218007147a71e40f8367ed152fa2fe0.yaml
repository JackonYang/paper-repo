paperAbstract: This paper presents a system which learns to answer questions on a
  broad range of topics from a knowledge base using few hand-crafted features. Our
  model learns low-dimensional embeddings of words and knowledge base constituents;
  these representations are used to score natural language questions against candidate
  answers. Training our system using pairs of questions and structured representations
  of their answers, and pairs of question paraphrases, yields competitive results
  on a recent benchmark of the literature.
