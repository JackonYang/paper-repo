paperAbstract: "We formulate a deformable template model for objects with an efficient\
  \ mechanism for computation and parameter estimation. The data consists of binary\
  \ oriented edge features, robust to photometric variation and small local deformations.\
  \ The template is defined in terms of probability arrays for each edge type. A primary\
  \ contribution of this paper is the definition of the instantiation of an object\
  \ in terms of shifts of a moderate number local submodels\u2014parts\u2014which\
  \ are subsequently recombined using a patchwork operation, to define a coherent\
  \ statistical model of the data. Object classes are modeled as mixtures of patchwork\
  \ of parts POP models that are discovered sequentially as more class data is observed.\
  \ We define the notion of the support associated to an instantiation, and use this\
  \ to formulate statistical models for multi-object configurations including possible\
  \ occlusions. All decisions on the labeling of the objects in the image are based\
  \ on comparing likelihoods. The combination of a deformable model with an efficient\
  \ estimation procedure yields competitive results in a variety of applications with\
  \ very small training sets, without need to train decision boundaries\u2014only\
  \ data from the class being trained is used. Experiments are presented on the MNIST\
  \ database, reading zipcodes, and face detection."
