paperAbstract: An approach to semi-supervised learning is proposed that is based on
  a Gaussian random field model. Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices
  in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances.
  The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this
  graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions,
  and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting
  learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks,
  and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the
  predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method
  of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability
  to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic
  data, digit classification, and text classification tasks.
