paperAbstract: "We present a distributed representation of pose and appearance of\
  \ people called the \u201Cposelet activation vector\u201D. First we show that this\
  \ representation can be used to estimate the pose of people defined by the 3D orientations\
  \ of the head and torso in the challenging PASCAL VOC 2010 person detection dataset.\
  \ Our method is robust to clutter, aspect and viewpoint variation and works even\
  \ when body parts like faces and limbs are occluded or hard to localize. We combine\
  \ this representation with other sources of information like interaction with objects\
  \ and other people in the image and use it for action recognition. We report competitive\
  \ results on the PASCAL VOC 2010 static image action classification challenge."
