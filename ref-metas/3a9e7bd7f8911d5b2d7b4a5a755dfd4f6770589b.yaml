paperAbstract: The CEDAR real-time address block location system, which determines
  candidates for the location of the destination address from a scanned mail piece
  image, is described. For each candidate destination address block (DAB), the address
  block location (ABL) system determines the line segmentation, global orientation,
  block skew, an indication of whether the address appears to be handwritten or machine
  printed, and a value indicating the degree of confidence that the block actually
  contains the destination address. With 20-MHz Sparc processors, the average time
  per mail piece for the combined hardware and software system components is 0.210
  seconds. The system located 89.0% of the addresses as the top choice. Recent developments
  in the system include the use of a top-down segmentation tool, address syntax analysis
  using only connected component data, and improvements to the segmentation refinement
  routines. This has increased top choice performance to 91.4%.<<ETX>>
