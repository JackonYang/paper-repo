paperAbstract: Gobbledoc, a system providing remote access to stored documents, which
  is based on syntactic document analysis and optical character recognition (OCR),
  is discussed. In Gobbledoc, image processing, document analysis, and OCR operations
  take place in batch mode when the documents are acquired. The document image acquisition
  process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a
  family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure
  converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems
  that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic
  analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks.
  Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document
  representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search
  than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout
  clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc
  preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and
  display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>
