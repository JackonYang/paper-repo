paperAbstract: Feel lonely? What about reading books? Book is one of the greatest
  friends to accompany while in your lonely time. When you have no friends and activities
  somewhere and sometimes, reading book can be a great choice. This is not only for
  spending the time, it will increase the knowledge. Of course the b=benefits to take
  will relate to what kind of book that you are reading. And now, we will concern
  you to try reading problem solving methods in artificial intelligence as one of
  the reading material to finish quickly.
