paperAbstract: In this paper it is shown that the classical maximum likelihood principle
  can be considered to be a method of asymptotic realization of an optimum estimate
  with respect to a very general information theoretic criterion. This observation
  shows an extension of the principle to provide answers to many practical problems
  of statistical model fitting.
