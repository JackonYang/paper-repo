paperAbstract: 'We describe and demonstrate a texture region descriptor which is invariant
  to affine geometric and photometric transformations, and insensitive to the shape
  of the texture region. It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar
  and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based
  on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors
  than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor
  are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same
  type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is
  used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of
  the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints.
  Results are presented on several sets of real images.'
