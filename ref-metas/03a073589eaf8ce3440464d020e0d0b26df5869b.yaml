paperAbstract: 'This paper presents a new algorithm for the automatic recognition
  of object classes from images (categorization). Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based
  object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The
  method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such
  as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies
  a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature
  space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are
  learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold:
  i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual
  words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by
  GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized
  by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object
  classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions,
  poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs
  acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released
  Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects
  (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)'
