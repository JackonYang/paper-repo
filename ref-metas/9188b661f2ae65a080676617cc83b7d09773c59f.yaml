paperAbstract: There have been important recent advances in object recognition through
  the matching of invariant local image features. However, the existing approaches
  are based on matching to individual training images. This paper presents a method
  for combining multiple images of a 3D object into a single model representation.
  This provides for recognition of 3D objects from any viewpoint, the generalization
  of models to non-rigid changes, and improved robustness through the combination
  of features acquired under a range of imaging conditions. The decision of whether
  to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it
  as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model
  views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches
  that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D
  and non-rigid models. A system has been developed based on these approaches that
  is able to robustly recognize 3D objects in cluttered natural images in sub-second
  times.
