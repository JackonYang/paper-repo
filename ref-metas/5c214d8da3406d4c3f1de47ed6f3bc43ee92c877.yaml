paperAbstract: '1. Quantitative analyses of orientation specificity and ocular dominance
  were carried out in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey. 2. Sharpness of orientation
  selectivity was greater for simple (S type) than for complex (CX type) cells. CX-type
  cells became more broadly tuned in the deeper cortical layers: S-type cells were
  equally well tuned throughout the cortex. 3. Sharpness of orientation selectivity
  for S-type cells was similar at all retinal eccentricities studied (0 degrees -
  20 degrees from the fovea):in CX-type cells orientation selectivity decreased slightly
  with increasing eccentricity. 4. The orientation tuning of binocular cells was similar
  when mapped separately through each eye. 5. Orientation selectivity and direction
  selectivity are independent of each other, suggesting that separate neural mechanisms
  give rise to them. 6. More CX-type cells can be binocularly activated than S-type
  cells (88% versus 49%). The ocular dominance of S-type cells is similar in all cortical
  layers: for CX-type cells there is an increase in the number of cells in ocular-dominance
  category 4 in layers 5 and 6.'
