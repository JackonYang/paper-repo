paperAbstract: "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition\
  \ of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries,\
  \ multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated\
  \ text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable\
  \ form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However,\
  \ text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in\
  \ images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates.\
  \ Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these\
  \ situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects\
  \ and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme\
  \ is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are\
  \ extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text\
  \ strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes\
  \ are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt\
  \ strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first\
  \ applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes\
  \ formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original\
  \ resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing\
  \ the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by\
  \ srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from\
  \ these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition\
  \ if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and\
  \ works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019\
