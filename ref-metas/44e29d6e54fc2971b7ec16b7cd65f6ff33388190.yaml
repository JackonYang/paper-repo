paperAbstract: Describes a syntactic approach to deducing the logical structure of
  printed documents from their physical layout. Page layout is described by a two-dimensional
  grammar, similar to a context-free string grammar, and a chart parser is used to
  parse segmented page images according to the grammar. This process is part of a
  system which reads scanned document images and produces computer-readable text in
  a logical mark-up format such as SGML. The system is briefly outlined, the grammar
  formalism and the parsing algorithm are described in detail, and some experimental
  results are reported.<<ETX>>
