paperAbstract: Recursive neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) are
  two connectionist models that can directly process graphs. RNNs and GNNs exploit
  a similar processing framework, but they can be applied to different input domains.
  RNNs require the input graphs to be directed and acyclic, whereas GNNs can process
  any kind of graphs. The aim of this paper consists in understanding whether such
  a difference affects the behaviour of the models on a real application. An experimental
  comparison on an image classification problem is presented, showing that GNNs outperforms
  RNNs. Moreover the main differences between the models are also discussed w.r.t.
  their input domains, their approximation capabilities and their learning algorithms.
