paperAbstract: 'Several recently-proposed architectures for high-performance object
  recognition are composed of two main stages: a feature extraction stage that extracts
  locally-invariant feature vectors from regularly spaced image patches, and a somewhat
  generic supervised classifier. The first stage is often composed of three main modules:
  (1) a bank of filters (often oriented edge detectors); (2) a non-linear transform,
  such as a point-wise squashing functions, quantization, or normalization; (3) a
  spatial pooling operation which combines the outputs of similar filters over neighboring
  regions. We propose a method that automatically learns such feature extractors in
  an unsupervised fashion by simultaneously learning the filters and the pooling units
  that combine multiple filter outputs together. The method automatically generates
  topographic maps of similar filters that extract features of orientations, scales,
  and positions. These similar filters are pooled together, producing locally-invariant
  outputs. The learned feature descriptors give comparable results as SIFT on image
  recognition tasks for which SIFT is well suited, and better results than SIFT on
  tasks for which SIFT is less well suited.'
