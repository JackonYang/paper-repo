paperAbstract: In machine learning, whether one can build a more accurate classifier
  by using unlabeled data (semi-supervised learning) is an important issue. Although
  a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP
  tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that
  employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find
  "what good classifiers are like" by learning from thousands of automatically generated
  auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive
  structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which
  can then be used to improve performance on the target problem. The method produces
  performance higher than the previous best results on CoNLL'00 syntactic chunking
  and CoNLL'03 named entity chunking (English and German).
