paperAbstract: The aim of this note is to extend some of the recent work on spline
  interpolation so as to include also a solution of the problem of graduation of data.
  The well-known method of graduation due to E. T. Whittaker suggests how this should
  be done. Here we merely describe the idea and the qualitative aspects of the new
  method, while proofs and the computational side will be discussed elsewhere.
