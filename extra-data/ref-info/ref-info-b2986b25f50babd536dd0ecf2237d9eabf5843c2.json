For example, we could (i) Smooth the n,'s for the range of values of r that interests us, holding in mind the above chi-squared test and the rule concerning Jr. The smoothing techniques may include the use of freehand curves. Rather than working directly with n,, n,, n,, . . . i t may be found more suitable to work with the cumulative sums n,, n, +n,, n, +n, +n,, . . . or with the cumulative sums of the rn,or with the logarithms log n,, log n,, log n,, . . ..There is much to be said for working with the numbers Jn,, Jn,, Jn,, . . . . For if we assume that V(n, I H ) is approximately equal to n, (and in view of (26) and (27) of $ 3 this approximation is not on the whole too bad), then it would follow that the standard deviation of Jn, is of the order of 4 and therefore largely independent of r. Hence graphical and other smoothing methods can be carried out without having constantly to hold in mind that I ni -n, I can reasonably take much larger values when n, is large than when it is small.

                "text": "The purpose of this paper is to deduce, from a number of examples and from theoretical considerations, some plausible general law as to how abundance or commonness is distributed among species. Experimentally, this could be done by making a complete census of every species, but, with rare exceptions, this procedure is quite impractical. We therefore attempt to deduce the \"universe\" from a sample. Commonness, as understood by ecologists, has several rather different meanings: we are here concerned with (1) the total number of living individuals of a given species, which might be called its global abundance, (2) the total number of individuals living at any instant on a given area, such as on an acre or a square mile, which might be called its local abundance, (3) the ratio which the number of individuals or one species bears to that of another species, i.e., its relative abundance, and (4) the number of individuals observed, for example, the number of a moth species counted in a sample from a light trap, its \"observed,\" \"apparent,\" or \"sample\" abundance. There will not usually be any difficulty in deciding which phase of the subject is under discussion at any time. The Raunkiaer \"Index of Frequency\" is a measure of ubiquity rather than of commonness as above defined: its relation to our other concepts is discussed later. As a rule, we are interested in a sample only in so far as it throws light upon the \"universe\" that is being sampled. The sample will be a sufficiently accurate replica of the universe provided (1) it is a perfectly \"random\" sample, and (2) no species is represented in the sample by less than 20 or 30 individuals. In most ecological work condition (2) will never obtain, and much of the present paper will center on this difficulty. Condition (1) will not usually obtain in the broadest sense, and needs a moment's consideration. A geologist sampling an ore-body, whose boundaries have been delimited accurately by previous exploration, has a known \"universe\" and merely needs information on composition. His universe is permanent. But in ecological work, the \"universe\" changes rapidly. The moths flying tonight are not those that flew a month ago, or will fly a month hence. Those flying this year are a vastly different association from those that flew last year in the same area. The same thing is true of rodent populations, of birds, and of plants. We are dealing with a fleeting and fluctuating assemblage, a \"universe\" continually expanding, contracting, and changing in composition. Thus it is important to recognize at the outset that, for the purposes of our present investigation, the \"universe\" from which the sample is drawn is that universe declared to us by the sample itself, and not our preconceived notion of what the universe ought to be. Further, it is important to recognize that the randomness we seek is merely randomness with respect to commonness or rarity. A light trap is satisfactory in this respect and samples its own universe appropriately. It is definitely selective in respect of phototropism, but it is random in respect of commonness, i.e., it does not care which of two moths, equally phototropic, it catches, though one may be a great rarity and the other of a very common species. On the other hand, an entomologist, or even an intelligent boy, with a net, is not a satisfactory collector, for he will go after the rarity. For this reason we have to reject Corbet's ('41)"

It is shown that in a large collection of Lepidoptera captured in Malaya the frequency of the number of species represented by different numbers of individuals fitted somewhat closely to a hyperbola type of curve, so long as only the rarer species were considered. The data for the commoner species was not so strictly `randomized', but the whole series could be closely fitted by a series of the logarithmic type as described by Fisher in Part 3. Other data for random collections of insects in the field were also shown to fit fairly well to this series. Part 2. Extensive data on the capture of about 1500 Macrolepidoptera of about 240 species in a light-trap at Harpenden is analysed in relation to Fisher's mathematical theory and is shown to fit extremely closely to the calculations. The calculations are applied first to the frequency of occurrence of species represented by different numbers of individuals--and secondly to the number of species in samples of different sizes from the same population. The parameter ` alpha ', which it is suggested should be called the `index of diversity', is shown to have a regular seasonal change in the case of the Macrolepidoptera in the trap. In addition, samples from two traps which overlooked somewhat different vegetation are shown to have ` alpha ' values which are significantly different. It is shown that, provided the samples are not small, ` alpha ' is the increase in the number of species obtained by increasing the size of a sample by e (2.718). A diagram is given (Fig. 8) from which any one of the values, total number of species, total number of individuals and index of diversity (alpha), can be obtained approximately if the other two are known. The standard error of alpha is also indicated on the same diagram. Part 3. A theoretical distribution is developed which appears to be suitable for the frequencies with which different species occur in a random collection, in the common case in which many species are so rare that their chance of inclusion is small. The relationships of the new distribution with the negative binomial and the Poisson series are established. Numerical processes are exhibited for fitting the series to observations containing given numbers of species and individuals, and for estimating the parameter alpha representing the richness in species of the material sampled; secondly, for calculating the standard error of alpha, and thirdly, for testing whether the series exhibits a significant deviation from the limiting form used. Special tables are presented for facilitating these calculations."

Both are defined as statistics to be calculated from sample data and not in terms of population constants. The index of diversity has so far been used chiefly with the logarithmic distribution. It cannot be used everywhere, as it does not always give values which are independent of sample size; it cannot do so, for example, when applied to an infinite population of individuals classified into a finite number of groups. Williams3 has pointed out a relationship between the characteristic and the index of diversity when both are applied to a logarithmic distribution. The present purpose is to define and examine a measure of concentration in terms of population constants."

Chapters i-xii of the work do not presuppose any advanced mathematical knowledge, while Chapters xiii-xvi present all the chief results of modern investigations. There are three appendixes to the book, in one of which an outline of the famous Tsebysheff-Markoff method of moments applied to the proof of the fundamental theorem established by another method in Chapter xiv is given.Introduction to Mathematical Probability By Prof. J.
