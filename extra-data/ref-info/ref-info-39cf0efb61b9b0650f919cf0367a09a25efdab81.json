One processor, the Pattern Articulation Unit (PAU), has been singled out for detailed discussion. Other units, in particular the Arithmetic Unit and the Taxicrinic Unit, are treated in reports listed in the bibliography. The PAU has been shown to be a processor of fundamentally new design-its logical organization has no analog in the central processing unit of existing computers. The PAU is the first modular parallel processor which because of its digital organization is capable of more reliable visual identification than part analog/part digital preprocessors of much less generality and potential virtuosity; is faster than any presently suggested alternative realizable today at comparable cost; and can serve as a prototype to a new generation of parallel computers that will capitalize upon thin film and integrated semiconductor circuitry of the immediate future."

The instruction repertoire is thoroughly discussed and several program examples are presented. In thelast section the implementation of the machine is described and v various tradeoffs between speed and economy are discussed.

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

                "text": "People are visually oriented beings. Knowledge of our environment is mainly garnered through visually deciphering forms and symbols that convey meanings. As with hearing, the quality of eyesight is not always a factor in a person's ability to interpret what is seen. Children with no sight impairment (i.e., 20/20 vision) can fail to develop visual perception skills that are necessary for learning in general and that are particularly crucial for learning how to read and write. Just as there is a difference between hearing and listening in auditory perception, so also there is a difference between looking and seeing in visual perception. Visual perception is training in seeing and interpreting visual stimuli. Efficient visual functioning normally takes some time to develop, hence the use of oversized and brightly colored visual materials in primary level classrooms. Although the majority of children successfully develop the ability to focus visually and to make fine discriminations in visual materials during the primary years, some will be well into the intermediate grades before these skills are adequately developed for visual learning tasks. Often these children will need special help. Children who are inefficiently processing visual stimuli may have some of the following difficulties. The inability to \u2022 Get meaning from visual clues \u2022 Focus on a stationary object \u2022 Discriminate characteristic differences in visual stimuli (i.e., color, shape, size/quantity, direction/distance) \u2022 Perceive individual parts as constituting a whole \u2022 Judge distance \u2022 Relate symbol to object \u2022 Separate foreground from background in a picture \u2022 Recognize and remember visual information \u2022 Track a moving object with the eyes \u2022 Reproduce simple visual patterns \u2022 Recognize familiar visual images when reduced or embellished \u2022 Direct an extremity to a specific target"
