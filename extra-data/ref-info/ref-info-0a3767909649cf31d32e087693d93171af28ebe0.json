                "text": "Belief networks are directed acyclic graphs in which the nodes represent propositions (or variables), the arcs signify direct dependencies between the linked propositions, and the strengths of these dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities. A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves."

Two related examples are considered: the Clifford-Green theorem on random Gaussian triangles, and a generalization of the D. G. Kendall theorem on the kinematics of shape. The Clifford\u2013Green theorem gives a remarkable characterization of the joint distribution of the squared-side-lengths of n independent Gaussian points in n-space, namely that this distribution is that of n independent exponential random variables conditioned to satisfy all the inequalities requisite if they are to arise as squared-side-lengths from a point-set in n-space. The D. G. Kendall theorem on the diffusion of shape identifies the statistics of the diffusion arising (under a time-change) as the shape of a triangle whose vertices diffuse by Brownian motion in 2-space or 3-space. Symbolic It\u00f4 calculus is used to give a new proof of the Clifford-Green theorem, and to generalize the D. G. Kendall theorem to the case of triangles in higher-dimensional space whose vertices diffuse either according to Brownian motion or according to an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This task is reduced to the approximation of the N-dimensional weight distribution of the N state variables assigned to the N nodes of the system, assumed to be of probabilistic type, given a set M of its marginal distributions (of considerably lower dimensionality than N as a rule; N of the order of 100), representing the pieces of knowledge accumulated in the Knowledge Base. The approximated missing inference weights will be then derived from it as one derives conditional probabilities from a joint probability distribution. Using approximations of the d.s.s. (dependence structure simplification) type, it was shown that this problem is easily solvable when M contains at most two-dimensional distributions. Now, we show, that the same takes place when M is representable by a triangulated graph."

The nodes correspond to variables which can be constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal the probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and the information available at the time of the decisions. The detailed data about the variables are stored within the nodes, so the diagram graph is compact and focuses attention on the relationships among the variables. Influence diagrams are effective communication tools and recent developments also allow them to be used for analysis. We develop algorithms to address questions of inference within a probabilistic model represented as an influence diagram. We use the conditional independence implied by the diagram's structure to determine the information needed to solve a given problem. When there is enough information we can solve it, exploiting that conditional independence. These same results are applied to problems of decision analysis. This methodology allows the construction of computer tools to maintain and evaluate complex models."

In recent years, however, the practical needs of expert systems have led to an interest in the use of numbers to encode partial confidence. There has been some effort to square the use of these numbers with Bayesian probability ideas, but in most applications not all the inputs required by Bayesian probability analyses are available. This difficulty has led to widespread interest in belief func- tions, which use probability in a looser way. It must be recognized, however, that even belief functions require more structure than is provided by pure production systems. The need for such structure is inherent in the nature of probability argument and cannot be evaded. Probability argument re- quires design as well as numerical inputs. The real challenge probability poses to artificial intelligence is to build systems that can design probability arguments. The real challenge artificial intelligence poses to statistics is to explain how statisticians design probability arguments."

KEYNES'S book is a searching analysis of the fundamental principles of the theory of probability and of the particular judgments involved in its application to concrete problems.

NO.Otherwise he does not attempt to define \u201cprobability,\u201d regarding it as a concept intelligible without further definition. In this respect, as in several others, he is in agreement with the views expressed by Dr. Wrinch and the present reviewer (Philosophical Magazine, vol. 38, 1919, pp. 715-31), and some comparison of the two presentations may not be out of place.A Treatise on ProbabilityBy J.

The information the method finds consists of joint probabilities that show significant probabilistic connections between the associated attribute values. These joint probabilities can be combined with information about particular cases to compute particular conditional probabilities as described in [3]. The search procedure and significance test required are presented for different types of data. The significance test requires finding if the minimum message length (in the information theory sense) required to encode the data is reduced if the joint probability being tested is given explicitly. This significance test is derived from Bayes' theorem and is shown to find the hypothesis (i.e. set of significant joint probabilities) with the highest posterior probability given the data."

It is an intuitive framework in which to formulate problems as perceived by decision makers and to incorporate the knowledge of experts. At the same time, it is a precise description of information that can be stored and manipulated by a computer. We develop an algorithm that can evaluate any well-formed influence diagram and determine the optimal policy for its decisions. Since the diagram can be analyzed directly, there is no need to construct other representations such as a decision tree. As a result, the analysis can be performed using the decision maker's perspective on the problem. Questions of sensitivity and the value of information are natural and easily posed. Modifications to the model suggested by such analyses can be made directly to the problem formulation, and then evaluated directly."

The second part develops a representation for qualitative knowledge of the structure and behavior of a mechanism. The qualitative simulation, or envisionment, process is given a qualitative structural description of a mechanism and some initialization information, and produces a detailed description of the mechanism's behavior. This \"vertical\" slice of the construction of a cognitive model demonstrator, an effective knowledge acquisition method for the purpose of determining the structure of the representation itself, not simply the content of the knowledge to be encoded in that representation. Most importantly, it demonstrates the interaction among constraints derived from the textbook knowledge of the domain, from observations of the human expert, and from the computational requirements of successful performance."

Among the many alternative numerical schemes for quantifying uncertainty that have been developed are the Certainty Factors used in Mycin (Shortliffe & Buchanan, 1975) and its descendants, Fuzzy Set Theory (Zadeh, 1984), the quasi-probabilistic scheme of Prospector (Duda et al., 1976), and the Belief functions of Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer, 1976). There have also been attempts to develop non-numerical schemes, including Paul Cohen\u2019s theory of endorsements (Cohen, 1985), Doyle\u2019s theory of reasoned assumptions (Doyle, 1983), and various linguistic representations of uncertainty (Fox, 1986).

It is based on two rules: first, that if a model is accepted, then all models that include it are considered to be accepted, and secondly, that if a model is rejected, then all its submodels are considered to be rejected. Two versions are described, one for the class of graphical models, and the other for the class of hierarchical log linear models. Application of both versions to a six-dimensional table is illustrated. The procedure can be regarded as an alternative to fitting all possible models, made computationally feasible by application of the two rules. It is a generalization of the procedure proposed by Havr'anek (1984), but is in many cases considerably faster."

It is shown that if the scores are additive for different events and if the person chooses admissible values only, then there exists a known transform of the values x to values which are probabilities. In particular, it follows that values x derived by significance tests, confidence intervals or by the rules of fuzzy logic are inadmissible.

We address the problem of determining whether a graph is a partial graph of a k-tree. This problem is motivated by the existence of polynomial time algorithms for many combinatorial problems on graphs when the graph is constrained to be a partial k-tree for fixed k. These algorithms have practical applications in areas such as reliability, concurrent broadcasting and evaluation of queries in a relational database system. We determine the complexity status of two problems related to finding the smallest number k such that a given graph is a partial k-tree. First, the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. Second, for a fixed (predetermined) value of k, we present an algorithm with polynomially bounded (but exponential in k) worst case time complexity. Previously, this problem had only been solved for $k = 1,2,3$."

Other properties of interest were studied by other researchers who described the same class in radically different terms, and found desirable properties in their own contexts. It is the purpose of this paper to define the class formally, to give its important properties and the equivalences with the other classes mentioned, and to explain the importance of each property.

Methods used include subjective Bayesian reasoning, measures of belief and disbelief, and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Analysis of systems based on these methods reveals important deficiencies in areas such as the reliability of deductions and the ability to detect inconsistencies in the knowledge from which deductions were made. A new system call INFERNO addresses some of these points. Its approach is probabilistic but makes no assumptions whatsoever about the joint probability distributions of pieces of knowledge, so the correctness of inferences can be guaranteed. INFERNO informs the user of inconsistencies that may be present in the information presented to it, and can make suggestions about changing the information to make it consistent. An example from a Bayesian system is reworked, and the conclusions reached by that system and INFERNO are compared."

These models are hierarchical models that can be represented by a simple, undirected graph on as many vertices as the dimension of the corresponding table. Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property. The class of graphical models contains that of decomposable models and we give a simple criterion for decomposability of a given graphical model. To some extent we discuss estimation problems and give suggestions for further work."

This paper provides an axiomatic basis, called a semigraphoid, which captures the structure common to all four types of dependencies and explores the expressive power of DAGs in representing various types of data dependencies. It is shown that DAGs can represent a richer set of dependencies than undirected graphs, that DAGs completely represent the closure of their specification bases, and that they offer an effective computational device for testing membership in that closure as well as inferring new dependencies from given inputs. These properties might explain the prevailing use of DAGs in causal reasoning and semantic nets."

We consider, among other things, hierarchical hypotheses pertaining to the interactions among the m variables, including hypotheses that can be expressed in terms of one or more of the following kinds of concepts: (a) the usual concepts of independence and equiprobability; (b) concepts describing conditional properties (e.g., conditional independence) pertaining to a subset of the m variables, given the level of some of the remaining variables; (c) concepts related to the usual logit-analysis or to a generalized form of logit-analysis; and (d) concepts related to a more general log-linear model. Methods of partitioning these hypotheses are introduced which provide, among other things, insight into the relationship between tests applied to the m-way table and tests applied to marginal tables formed ..."

Since numerous authors have rejected probability as inadequate for various reasons, the bulk of the paper is aimed at refuting these claims and indicating the scources of error. In particular, the definition of probability as a measure of belief rather than a frequency ratio is advocated, since a frequency interpretation of probability drastically restricts the domain of applicability. Other sources of error include the confusion between relative and absolute probability, the distinction between probability and the uncertainty of that probability. Also, the interaction of logic and probability is discusses and it is argued that many extensions of logic, such as \"default logic\" are better understood in a probabilistic framework. The main claim of this paper is that the numerous schemes for representing and reasoning about uncertainty that have appeared in the AI literature are unnecessary--probability is all that is needed."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

For example, F might be the event that the captain of a firing squad shouts \u201cFire\u201d and E might be that the victim\u2019s life is Ended (F for Fire, E for Ended). The negation of E is denoted by \u0112, which in this example means that the victim does not drop dead. The question arises whether Q(E:F) can be sensibly defined in terms of physical probability = material probability.3 I believe there is a good definition which, to state it roughly, is the weight of evidence against F if E does not occur (Good 1961, 1980e). If the victim does not drop dead it is strong evidence that the captain did not shout \u201cFire\u201d. In other words the captain\u2019s order to fire had a great deal to do with the potential death of the victim."

It is applied to the particular case of two multivariate normal distributions with a common covariance matrix. An affine transformation, to which the key quantities are invariant, simplifies discussion of the distribution of the estimated log odds ratio and suggests a practically useful plot which generalizes the usual display of discriminant scores and has several attractive features. An illustration is given. Two approximate interval estimation techniques for the true log odds ratio are described and evaluated in a range of practical situations by a simulation study. Some further applications of our general approach are briefly indicated."

A substantive rationale for the general model is presented, and several special cases are discussed along with some possible substantive interpretations. A computational algorithm based on iterative scaling procedures for use in fitting data is described, as are the results of a pilot simulation study. An example using previously reported empirical data is worked out in detail. An extension to multiple relationship data is discussed briefly."

This method arranges objects into classes representing certain descriptive concepts, rather than into classes defined solely by a similarity metric in some a priori defined attribute space. A specific form of the method is conjunctive conceptual clustering, in which descriptive concepts are conjunctive statements involving relations on selected object attributes and optimized according to an assumed global criterion of clustering quality. The method, implemented in program CLUSTER/2, is tested together with 18 numerical taxonomy methods on two exemplary problems: 1) a construction of a classification of popular microcomputers and 2) the reconstruction of a classification of selected plant disease categories. In both experiments, the majority of numerical taxonomy methods (14 out of 18) produced results which were difficult to interpret and seemed to be arbitrary. In contrast to this, the conceptual clustering method produced results that had a simple interpretation and corresponded well to solutions preferred by people."

In the present paper, this approach has been generalized to direct unsaturated hierarchical loglinear models. General rules for determining closed form expressions for asymptotic variances in such situations are obtained; bounds for the asymptotic variances of u terms in indirect models are considered; and these rules are compared with other methods of producing asymptotic variances."

                "text": "Results from animal experiments are often used to assess cancer risks to humans from low doses of chemicals. This involves two extrapola- tions: from high dose to low dose and from animals to humans. This paper will review the logic of both. In general, absent other information, we think that a chemical that is carcinogenic in a well-run animal experiment should be viewed with some suspicion. However, there are real problems with most animal experiments as they are currently done, and there are serious inconsistencies in the results. One probable cause is poorly defined end points, and another is uncontrolled variation. A number of suggestions are made for improvement, including proper randomization, \"blinding\" the necropsy work and use of statistical techniques appropriate to multiple end points. Numerical assessments of human risk, even if based on good animal data, seem well beyond the scope of the scientifically possible. There are substan- tial differences in sensitivity between species, strains, sexes and individuals. Experimental work is needed to quantify these differences and explore their biological bases. The dose-response models now used in numerical extrap- olation are quite far removed from the biology. At present there seems to be no sound way to choose a model on either biological or statistical grounds, and different models give substantially different risk estimates. On this score, there is little hope for progress until the biology of cancer is better understood. The paper is organized as follows. The issues are set out in the first section. Then the one-hit model is introduced in the context of a stylized risk assessment for DDT. Next the main generalizations of the one-hit model are explained: the multihit, Weibull and multistage. The biological foundations for these models are reviewed, and the impact of model selection on low-dose risk estimates is stressed. Dose scales and biological scaling factors are discussed, and then the conventional arguments for the mouse- to-man extrapolation. The DDT carcinogenesis literature is surveyed to show the quality of animal experiments. Opinions by others are cited, and conclusions are drawn."

Unfortunately, causes of variation often seem to be beyond control. In the biological sciences, especially, one often has to deal with a group of characteristics or conditions which are correlated because of a complex of interacting, uncontrollable, and often obscure causes. The degree of correlation between two variables can be calculated by well-known methods, but when it is found it gives merely the resultant of all connecting paths of influence. The present paper is an attempt to present a method of measuring the direct influence along each separate path in such a system and thus of finding the degree to which variation of a given effect is determined by each particular cause. The method depends on the combination of knowledge of the degrees of correlation among the variables in a system with such knowledge as may be possessed of the causal relations. In cases in which the causal relations are uncertain the method can be used to find the logical consequences of any particular hypothesis in regard to them. CORRELATION"

To document the strengths and weaknesses of the program we performed a systematic evaluation of the capabilities of INTERNIST-I. Its performance on a series of 19 clinicopathological exercises (Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital) published in the Journal appeared qualitatively similar to that of the hospital clinicians but inferior to that of the case discussants. The evaluation demonstrated that the present form of the program is not sufficiently reliable for clinical applications. Specific deficiencies that must be overcome include the program\u2019s inability to reason anatomically or temporally, its inability to construct differential diagnoses spanning multiple problem areas, its occasional attribution of findings to improper causes, and its inability to explain its \u201cthinking.\u201d (N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:468\u201376."

In particular, we consider two simple models of random systems: one generalizing the notion of \u201cGibbs ensemble\u201d abstracted from statistical physics; the other, \u201cMarkov fields\u201d derived from the idea of a Markov chain. We give background for these two types, review proofs that they are in fact identical for systems with nonzero probabilities, and explore the new behavior that arises with constraints. Finally, we discuss unsolved problems and make suggestions for further work."

We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements."

This collection of articles is a course book on the causal modeling approach to theory construction and data analysis. H. M. Blalock, Jr. summarizes the then-current developments in causal model utilization in sociology, political science, economics, and other disciplines. This book provides a comprehensive multidisciplinary picture of the work on causal models. It seeks to address the problem of measurement in the social sciences and to link theory and research through the development of causal models.Organized into five sections (Simple Recursive Models, Path Analysis, Simultaneous Equations Techniques, The Causal Approach to Measurement Error, and Other Complications), this volume contains twenty-seven articles (eight of which were specially commissioned). Each section begins with an introduction explaining the concepts to be covered in the section and links them to the larger subject. It provides a general overview of the theory and application of causal modeling.Blalock argues for the development of theoretical models that can be operationalized and provide verifiable predictions. Many of the discussions of this subject that occur in other literature are too technical for most social scientists and other scholars who lack a strong background in mathematics. This book attempts to integrate a few of the less technical papers written by econometricians such as Koopmans, Wold, Strotz, and Fisher with discussions of causal approaches in the social and biological sciences. This classic text by Blalock is a valuable source of material for those interested in the issue of measurement in the social sciences and the construction of mathematical models."

The procedure operates on a sample covariance matrix in which the fixed classes play the role of variables and the random classes correspond to observations. Cases are considered which assume (i) homogeneous and (ii) nonhomogeneous error variance, and (iii) arbitrary scale factors in the measurements and homogeneous error variance. The results include maximum-likelihood estimations of the variance components and scale factors, likelihood-ratio tests of the goodness-of-fit of the model assumed for the design, and large-sample variances and covariances of the estimates. Applications to mental test data are presented. In these applications the subjects constitute the random dimension of the design, and a classification of the mental tests according to objective features of format or content constitute the fixed dimensions."

Necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsibility are found in terms of the generating class. It is shown that log linear models are appropriate for tables with response and explanatory variables if and only if they are collapsible onto the explanatory variables. Some key word8: Collapsibility; Contingency table; Graphical model; Interaction graph; Log linear model; Response variable; S-sufficiency. shown to be closely related. Some models have the property that relations between a set of the classifying factors may be studied by examination of the table of marginal totals formed by summing over the remaining factors. Such models are said to be collapsible onto the given set of factors. Collapsibility has important consequences for hypothesis testing and model selection, and can be useful in data reduction. We consider various definitions of collapsibility and show their equivalence. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsi- bility are found in terms of the generating class. Many tables analysed in practice involve response variables. Simple examples, one of which is given in ? 3, suffice to show the importance of distinguishing between response and explanatory variables: first, that inappropriate models may be avoided, and second that natural and relevant models that are not log linear may be considered. This paper characterizes appropriate and inappropriate log linear models for tables with response variables and some alternative approaches for the analysis of such tables are briefly considered. We consider a multidimensional contingency table N based on a set of classifying factors F. For a given subset a of F we are interested in the table of marginal totals Na, that is to say the table of cell counts summed over the remaining factors aC, that is the complement of a in F. We identify a hierarchical log linear model L, that is the set of probabilities p E L, with its generating class, whose elements, generators, are given in square brackets: thus for example the model (AB) (BCD) for a 4-way table corresponds"

General conditions are given which lead to a simplification of the computations required to plot this function or calculate interval estimates based upon it. The results presented are rather general with a variety of possible applications. In particular, it is shown that they provide a simple solution to the important practical problem of obtaining an interval estimate for the posterior log odds ratio in the two population discrimination problem. The results are applied to the multivariate normal unequal covariance matrix case and are illustrated by an application."

The primary elements measure the unique contribution of each explanatory variable whereas the secondary and higher order elements measure the effective balance In the observed design. It Is remarked herein that the elements correspond to the parameters of a saturated factorial model fitted to the likelihood function. This permits a coherent computational procedure.

On the customary assumptions, a causal chain system is designed so that its relations both in the original form and in the reduced form can be specified in terms of conditional expectations, whereas the relations of interdependent systems allow such specification only in the reduced form. A third type of model is discussed, called conditional causal chains, which formally is similar to interdependent systems, with the important difference that the behavioural relations of the original system are specified in terms of conditional expectations."

A payoff function which depends on the assessor's stated probabilities and on the event which actually occurs may be used (1) to keep the assessor honest or (2) to evaluate the assessor. It is shown that with the exception of a logarithmic payoff function, these two uses of payoff functions for assessors are not compatible.

We give a new linear-time algorithm to calculate the fill-in produced by any elimination ordering, and we give two new related algorithms for finding orderings with special properties. One algorithm, based on breadth-first search, finds a perfect elimination ordering, if any exists, in $O(n + e)$ time, if the problem graph has n vertices and e edges. An extension of this algorithm finds a minimal (but not necessarily minimum) ordering in $O(ne)$ time. We conjecture that the problem of finding a minimum ordering is NP-complete"

Some ideas for combining these models are described, and the various models and computational methods are applied to the analysis of data for a corporate interlock network of the 25 largest organizations in Minneapolis/St. Paul and for a classic network of 18 monks in a cloister.

It synthesises ideas from economics, statistics, psychology, operations research, and other disciplines. A great deal of behavioural research is relevant to decision analysis; behavioural scientists have both suggested easy and natural ways to describe and quantify problems and shown the kind of errors to which unaided intuitive judgements can lead. This long-awaited book offers the4first integrative presentation of the principles of decision analysis in a behavioural context. The authors break new ground on a variety of technical topics (sensitivity analysis, the value-utility distinction, multistage inference, attitudes toward risk), and attempt to make intuitive sense out of what have been treated in the literature as endemic biases and other errors of human judgement. Those interested in artificial intelligence will find it the easiest presentation of hierarchical Bayesian inference available."

The relation of our results to the usual linear structural equations on the one hand, and to log-linear models, on the other, is also explained"

An outline of the basic equations and assumptions of each are presented. One example of a conceptual data matrix is analysed by both MSA-I and MSA-11 and the results are discussed vis-a-vis a hand analysis by Guttman imposing parallel straight line boundaries preserving ordered categories. Finally, some comparisons are made between the two scalogram procedures."

Research on computer-aided diagnosis began in the 1960s with high hopes that difficult clinical problems might yield to mathematical formalisms. Most work therefore centered on the application of flow charts, Boolean algebra, pattern matching, and decision analysis to .\u00a0.\u00a0."

The statistical approaches to the analysis of data on sets of interrelated individuals are then discussed, and resulting problems of sampling design and analysis are considered."

Most current inference systems in artificial intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts. We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements."
