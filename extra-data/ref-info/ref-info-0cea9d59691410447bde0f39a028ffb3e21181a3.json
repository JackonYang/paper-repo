In the square linear blind source separation problem without time delays, \none must find an unmixing matrix which can detangle the result of mixing n unknown independent sources \nthrough an unknown n x n mixing matrix. The recently introduced ICA blind source separation algorithm \n(Baram and Roth 1994; Bell and Sejnowski 1995) is a powerful and surprisingly simple technique for solving \nthis problem. ICA is all the more remarkable for performing so well despite making absolutely no use of the \ntemporal structure of its input! This paper presents a new algorithm, contextual ICA, which derives from a \nmaximum likelihood density estimation formulation of the problem. cICA can incorporate arbitrarily complex \nadaptive history-sensitive source models, and thereby make use of the temporal structure of its input. \nThis allows it to separate in a number of situations where standard ICA cannot, including sources with low \nkurtosis, colored gaussian sources, and sources which have gaussian histograms. Since ICA is a special case \nof cICA, the MLE derivation provides as a corollary a rigorous derivation of classic ICA."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

Two important features of our algorithm are that (a) the covariance of the additive noise can be estimated as a regular parameter, (b) in the case of discrete sources, it is possible to separate more sources than sensors.

We combine the work of Torkkola and Amari, Cichocki and Yang, to give Natural Gradient information maximisation rules for recurrent (IIR) networks, blindly adjusting delays, separating and deconvolving mixed signals. While they work well on simulated data, these rules fail in real rooms which usually involve non-minimum phase transfer functions, not-invertible using stable IIR filters. An approach that sidesteps this problem is to perform infomax on a feedforward architecture in the frequency domain (Lambert 1996). We demonstrate real-room separation of two natural signals using this approach."

Each point is the average of 10 experiments. to estimate the cross-cumulants. Each point in Fig. 1 corresponds to the average over 10 experiments, in which the mixing matrix is randomly chosen: The matrix entries mC3 (i # j) are random numbers in the range [-1, +1]. With 500 samples, a residual crosstalk of about-20 dB is obtained. In the case of nonstationary signals, cross-cumulant estimation must be done on few samples and has a larger variance. Consequently, it can lead to more inaccurate estimation of the mixing matrix. We still obtained an interesting performance: a residual crosstalk of about-15 to-20 dB, with various signals (colored noise, speech) and statistics estimated over 500 samples. In this correspondence, we proved that the mixing matrix can be. estimated using fourth-ordercross-cumulants, for two mixtures of two non-Gaussian sources. Solutions are obtained by rooting a fourth-order polynomial equation. Using second-order cross-cumulants allows us to simplify the method; the solution is then obtained by rooting two second-order polynomial equations and gives the result if one source is Gaussian. The methods are then quite simple, but its roots are very sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated cumulants. In fact, this direct solution is less accurate than indirect methods, especially adaptive a l g o r i b s. Moreover, we restricted the study to the separation of two sources, and theoretical solutions for three sources or more seems not easily tractable. However, in the case of two mixtures of two sources, it may give a good starting point with a small computation cost for any adaptive algorithm. REFERENCES J.-F.

The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm are verified by computer simulations."

Here we discuss how an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm may be used to elucidate the higher-order structure of natural signals, yielding their independent basis functions. This is illustrated with the ICA transform of the sound of a fingernail tapping musically on a tooth. The resulting independent basis functions look like the sounds themselves, having similar temporal envelopes and the same musical pitches. Thus they reflect both the phase and frequency information inherent in the data."
