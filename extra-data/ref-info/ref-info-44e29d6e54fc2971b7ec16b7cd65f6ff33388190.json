Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"

The lexical information is the basis of the parsing process while the encyclopaedic information forms the target representation and is used in the knowledge acquisition process. This paper describes TWIG, a text understanding system where these two knowledge bases arc integrated into one representation. There is some theoretical justification for this and it has the advantage of reducing duplication of information in the system. This integration also has the advantage of making conceptual information available during the parsing process. Most of all this integration of diverse information forms a natural basis for a blackboard architecture."
