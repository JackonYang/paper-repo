However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

One of them is intelligent form analysis. This paper describes a generic system for form dropout when the filled-in characters or symbols are either touching or crossing the form frames. We propose a method to separate these characters from form frames whose locations are unknown. Since some of the character strokes are either touching or crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: 1) localization of form frames; 2) separation of characters and form frames; and 3) reconstruction of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically located by finding long straight lines based on the block adjacency graph. Form frame separation and character reconstruction are implemented by means of this graph. The proposed system includes form structure learning and form dropout. First, a form structure-based template is automatically generated from a blank form which includes form frames, preprinted data areas and skew angle. With this form template, our system can then extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental results on three different types of forms show the performance of our system. Further, the proposed method is robust to noise and skew that is introduced during scanning."

In this method, two-dimensional multiresolution analysis, a wavelet decomposition algorithm, and compactly supported orthonormal wavelets are used to transform a document image into sub-images. According to these sub-images, the reference lines of a multi-gray level document can be extracted, and knowledge about the geometric structure of the document can be acquired. Particularly, this approach is more efficient to process form documents with gray level background. Experiments indicate that this new method can be applied to process documents with promising results."
