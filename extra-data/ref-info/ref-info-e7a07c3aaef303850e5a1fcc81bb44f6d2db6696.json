These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the \u201ccontext\u201d of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

We then further restrict the problem to classifying and automatically routing such a call, based on the meaning of the user's response. Thus, we aim at extracting a relatively small number of semantic actions from the utterances of a very large set of users who are not trained to the system's capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we describe the main components of our speech understanding system: the large vocabulary recognizer and the language understanding module performing the call-type classification. In particular, we propose automatic algorithms for selecting phrases from a training corpus in order to enhance the prediction power of the standard word n-gram. The phrase language models are integrated into stochastic finite state machines which outperform standard word n-gram language models. From the speech recognizer output we recognize and exploit automatically-acquired salient phrase fragments to make a call-type classification. This system is evaluated on a database of 10 K fluently spoken utterances collected from interactions between users and human agents."

A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well."

One can use existing classifiers by ignoring the hierarchical structure, treating the topics as separate classes. Unfortunately, in the context of text categorization, we are faced with a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish between them. Consequently, we are restricted to using only very simple classifiers, both because of computational cost and the tendency of complex models to overfit. We propose an approach that utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to decompose the classification task into a set of simpler problems, one at each node in the classification tree. As we show, each of these smaller problems can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very small set of features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set of relevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy, so that, while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each classifier only examines a small subset. The use of reduced feature sets allows us to utilize more complex (probabilistic) models, without encountering the computational and robustness difficulties described above."

We give a simplified analysis of AdaBoost in this setting, and we show how this analysis can be used to find improved parameter settings as well as a refined criterion for training weak hypotheses. We give a specific method for assigning confidences to the predictions of decision trees, a method closely related to one used by Quinlan. This method also suggests a technique for growing decision trees which turns out to be identical to one proposed by Kearns and Mansour. We focus next on how to apply the new boosting algorithms to multiclass classification problems, particularly to the multi-label case in which each example may belong to more than one class. We give two boosting methods for this problem, plus a third method based on output coding. One of these leads to a new method for handling the single-label case which is simpler but as effective as techniques suggested by Freund and Schapire. Finally, we give some experimental results comparing a few of the algorithms discussed in this paper."

We use a training set of texts with expert-assigned categories to construct a network which approximately reflects the conditional probabilities of categories given a text. The input nodes of the network are words in the training texts, the nodes on the intermediate level are the training texts, and the output nodes are categories. The links between nodes are computed based on statistics of the word distribution and the category distribution over the training set. ExpNet is used for relevance ranking of candidate categories of an arbitrary text in the case of text categorization, and for relevance ranking of documents via categories in the case of text retrieval. We have evaluated ExpNet in categorization and retrieval on a document collection of the MEDLINE database, and observed a performance in recall and precision comparable to the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping method, and significantly better than other methods tested. Computationally, ExpNet has an O(N 1og N) time complexity which is much more efficient than the cubic complexity of the LLSF method. The simplicity of the model, the high recall-precision rates, and the efficient computation together make ExpNet preferable as a practical solution for real-world applications."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

                "text": "This dissertation introduces a new theoretical model for text classification systems, including systems for document retrieval, automated indexing, electronic mail filtering, and similar tasks. The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods."

Both form a set of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances. This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets considered."

Boosting is a general method of improving the ac- curacy of a given base or \"weak\" learning algorithm. ECOC is a robust method of solving multiclass learning problems by reducing to a sequence of two-class problems. We show that our new hybrid method has advantages of both: Like ECOC, our method only requires that the base learning al- gorithm work on binary-labeled data. Like boosting, we prove that the method comes with strong theoretical guar- antees on the training and generalization error of the final combined hypothesis assuming only that the base learning algorithm perform slightly better than random guessing. Although previous methods were known for boosting multi- class problems, the new method may be significantly faster and require less programming effort in creating the base learning algorithm. We also compare the new algorithm experimentally to other voting methods."

The purpose of the current work is to describe some ways in which boosting can be applied to the problem of text categorization, and to test its performance relative to a number of other text-categorization algorithms. Text-categorization problems are usually multiclassin the sense that there are usually more than two possible categories. Although in some applications there may be a very large number of categories, in this work, we focus on the case in which there are a small to moderate number of categories. It is also common for text-categorization tasks to be multilabel, meaning that the categories are not mutually exclusive so that the same document may be relevant to more than one category. For instance, bibliographic medical articles are routinely given multiple Medical Subject Index (MeSH) categories when entered into Medline, the national bibliographic searchable archive which contains more than twenty million documents. While most machine-learning systems are designed to handle multiclass data, much less common are systems that can handle multi-label data. While numerous categorization algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbor, can be adapted to multi-label categorization problems, when machine-learning and other approaches are applied to text-categorization problems, a common technique has been to decompose the multi-class, multi-label problem into multiple, independent binary classification problems (one per category). In this paper, we adopt a different approach in which we use two extensions of AdaBoost that were specifically intended for multiclass, multi-label data. In the first extension, the goal of the learning algorithm is to predict all and only all of the correct labels. Thus, the learned classifier is evaluated in terms of its ability to predict a good approximation of the set of labels associated with a given document. In the second extension, the goal is to design a classifier that ranks the labels so that the correct labels will receive the highest ranks. We next describe BoosTexter, a system which embodies four versions of boosting based on these extensions, and we discuss the implementation issues that arise in multi-label text categorization. There has been voluminous work done on text categorization, including techniques based on decision trees, neural networks, nearest neighbor methods, Rocchio\u2019s method, supportvector machines, linear least squares, naive Bayes, rule-based methods and more.

Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman 1996a) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire 1996) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithms. Our results clearly show two important facts. The first is that even though Bagging almost always produces a better classifier than any of its individual component classifiers and is relatively impervious to overfitting, it does not generalize any better than a baseline neural-network ensemble method. The second is that Boosting is a powerful technique that can usually produce better ensembles than Bagging; however, it is more susceptible to noise and can quickly overfit a data set."

One of the more effective is bagging. Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym arcing) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce the definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components of the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on a large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions either through bagging or arcing reduces variance significantly."

In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning."

One of the more effective is bagging (Breiman [1996a]) Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire [1995,1996] propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym-arcing) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce the definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components of the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on a large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions either through bagging or arcing reduces variance significantly"

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance"

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

The first and the third performance measures asses the general quality of the label ranking while the second measure evaluates the classification quality. For further details on these evaluation measures see Yang (to appear). To use the F1 measure we need to set a threshold for the label-rankings and decide which labels should be associated with a document. We evaluated the performance using two thresholds: the zero threshold and a threshold that was adjusted so as to maximize F1 on the training data after AdaBoost.MH completed 10 , 00 rounds. In Table 2 we summarize the results and compare them to the best results obtained by Yang. (We would like to note parenthetically that in a very recent work, which was brought to out attention during the final preperations of this paper, Weiss et al. (1999) report a break-even point of 87% using the Reuters21578 dataset."

These two algorithms have been highly studied in the theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that these algorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming the decision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprentice system in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributions of this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in the experiments) that is especially suited to conditions with string-valued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis of its performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied to achieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues that arise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policy for discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it to speed up as it learns."

In this paper, we adopt a different approach in which we use tw o extensions of AdaBoost that were specifically intended for multiclass, multi-labe l data. In the first extension, the goal of the learning algorithm is to predict all and only all o f the correct labels. Thus, the learned classifier is evaluated in terms of its ability to predict a good approximation of the set of labels associated with a given document. In the sec ond extension, the goal is to design a classifier that ranks the labels so that the correct labels will receive the highes t ranks. We next describe BoosTexter, a system which embodies four versions of boosting based on these extensions, and we discuss the implementatio n issues that arise in multilabel text categorization. There has been voluminous work done on text categorization, including techniques based on decision trees, neural networks, nearest neighbor metho ds, Rocchio's method, supportvector machines, linear least squares, naive Bayes, rule-b as d methods and more. (See, for instance, (Apt\u00e9, Damerau, & Weiss, 1994; Biebricher, F uhr, Lustig, Schwantner, & Knorz, 1988; Cohen & Singer, 1996; Field, 1975; Fuhr & Pfeifer , 1994; Koller & Sahami, 1997; Lewis & Ringuette, 1994; Moulinier, Ra\uf6beskinis, & Gana sci , 1996; Ng, Goh, & Low, 1997; Yang, 1994).) It would be impossible for us to compare o ur algorithms to all of the previous methods. Instead, we compare to four very differen t methods which we believe are representative of some of the most effective techniques available, and report results on several different tasks. Our experiments show that, using a number of evaluation measures, our system's performance is generally better than the other algorithms, sometimes by a wide margin. To further compare our algorithm to other methods, we tested th performance of BoosTexter on a standard benchmark problem so that performance c ould be compared directly with a large body of results reported in the literature. We sp cifically focus on a recent study by Yang (1999) who conducted several experiments on th is benchmark and who also surveyed many results reported by other authors."

The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described. Finally, the conditions of the application as well as problems of further development are discussed."

Because of the underlying complexity of many such tasks, however, the models of the world implicitly or explicitly embedded in such tools are often incomplete and the problem-solving methods fallible. The result can be \"brittleness\" in situations that were not anticipated by the system designers. To deal with this weakness, it has been suggested that \"cooperative\" rather than \"automated\" problem-solving systems be designed. Such cooperative systems are proposed to explicitly enhance the collaboration of the person (or a group of people) and the computer system. This study evaluates the impact of alternative design concepts on the performance of 30 airline pilots interacting with such a cooperative system designed to support enroute flight planning. The results clearly demonstrate that different system design concepts can strongly influence the cognitive processes and resultant performances of users. Based on think-aloud protocols, cognitive models are proposed to account for how features of the Computer system interacted with specific types of scenarios to influence exploration and decision making by the pilots. The results are then used to develop recommendations for guiding the design of cooperative systems."
