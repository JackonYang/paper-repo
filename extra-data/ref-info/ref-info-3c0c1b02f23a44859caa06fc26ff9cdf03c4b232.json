Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

However, to facilitate sequential inference (e.g. over time or scale) and to allow the representation of ambiguity, it is desirable to represent an entire probability distribution for object location. Although the cross correlation itself (or some function of it) has sometimes been treated as a probability distribution, this is not generally justifiable. Bayesian correlation achieves a consistent probabilistic treatment by combining several developments. The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions in probabilistic terms, as observation likelihoods. Second, probability distributions of filter bank responses are learned from training examples. Inescapably, response learning also demands statistical modelling of background intensities, and there are links here with image coding and Independent Component Analysis. Lastly, multi scale processing is achieved in a Bayesian context by means of a new algorithm, layered sampling, for which asymptotic properties are derived."

In this paper, we present a framework for combining and sharing information among several state estimation processes operating on the same underlying visual object. Well-known techniques for joint probabilistic data association are adapted to yield increased robustness when multiple trackers attuned to disparate visual cues are deployed simultaneously. We also formulate a measure of tracker confidence, based on distinctiveness and occlusion probability, which permits the deactivation of trackers before erroneous state estimates adversely affect the ensemble. We discuss experiments focusing on color-region- and snake-based tracking that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach."

In this framework, the probability density of the tracker state is represented as a set of modes with piecewise Gaussians characterizing the neighborhood around these modes. The temporal evolution of the probability density is achieved through sampling from the prior distribution, followed by local optimization of the sample positions to obtain updated modes. This method of generating hypotheses from state-space search does not require the use of discrete features unlike classical multiple-hypothesis tracking. The parametric form of the model is suited for high dimensional state-spaces which cannot be efficiently modeled using non-parametric approaches. Results are shown for tracking Fred Astaire in a movie dance sequence."

We choose \"tests\" (matched filters for short road segments) one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the \"true hypothesis\" (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are chosen online based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated in simple and explicit analytical terms. At each iteration new image data are examined and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image location to inspect, and so forth.

                "text": "We address the problem of reconstructing the 3-dimensional motions of a human gure from a monocular image sequence. We take a statistical approach, and use a set of motion capture examples to build a gaussian probability model for short human motion sequences. We rst study this model in a simpli ed rendering domain. This yields analytic results for the optimal 3-d estimate given a 2-d temporal sequence, as well as for which motion modes are di cult to estimate. The results from the simpli ed rendering conditions show that if we can overlay a stick gure on an image of a moving human, we can estimate his or her 3-d motion well. We built an interactive tracking system to process real video sequences, and can achieve good 3-d reconstructions of the human gure motion.

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

The required density of the state vector is represented as a set of random samples, which are updated and propagated by the algorithm. The method is not restricted by assumptions of linear- ity or Gaussian noise: it may be applied to any state transition or measurement model. A simula- tion example of the bearings only tracking problem is presented. This simulation includes schemes for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm. For this example, the performance of the bootstrap filter is greatly superior to the standard extended Kalman filter."

Real-time high-level systems perform poorly in clutter and initialisation for most high-level systems is either performed manually or by a separate module. This paper presents a new technique to combine low- and high-level information in a consistent probabilistic framework, using the statistical technique of importance sampling combined with the Condensation algorithm. The general framework, which we term Icondensation, is described, and a hand tracker is demonstrated which combines colour blob-tracking with a contour model. The resulting tracker is robust to rapid motion, heavy clutter and hand-coloured distractors, and re-initialises automatically. The system runs comfortably in real time on an entry-level desktop workstation."

Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex."

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features."

Steerable filters may be designed in quadrature pairs to allow adaptive control over phase as well as orientation. The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

Local edge cues, implemented by filters, provide information about the likely positions of edges which can be used as input to higher-level models. Different edge cues can be evaluated by the statistical effectiveness of their corresponding filters evaluated on a dataset of 100 presegmented images. We use information theoretic measures to determine the effectiveness of a variety of different edge detectors working at multiple scales on black and white and color images. Our results give quantitative measures for the advantages of multi-level processing, for the use of chromaticity in addition to greyscale, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors."

This graph partitioning process, mainly motivated by computational efficiency considerations, is usually implemented as recursive bi-partitioning, where at each step the graph is broken into two parts based on a partitioning measure. We study four such measures, namely, the minimum cut, average cut, Shi-Malik normalized cut, and a variation of the Shi-Malik normalized cut. Using probabilistic analysis we show that the minimization of the average cut and the normalized cut measure, using recursive bi-partitioning will, on an average, result in the correct segmentation. The minimum cut and the variation of the normalized cut will, on an average, not result in the correct segmentation and we can precisely express the conditions. Based on a rigorous empirical evaluation, we also show that, in practice, the quality of the groups generated using minimum, average or normalized cuts are statistically equivalent for object recognition, i.e. the best, the mean, and the variation of the qualities are statistically equivalent. We also find that for certain image classes, such as aerial and scenes with man-made objects in man-made surroundings, the performance of grouping by partitioning is the worst, irrespective of the cut measure."
