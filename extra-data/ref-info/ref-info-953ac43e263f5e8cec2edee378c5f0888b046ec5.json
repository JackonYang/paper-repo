Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection."

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

In the light of our experiments, we suggest improvements to the shape context: shape contexts are used to find corresponding features between model and image. In real images it is shown that the shape context is highly influenced by clutters; furthermore, even when the object is correctly localized, the feature correspondence may be poor. We show that the robustness of shape matching can be increased by including a figural continuity constraint. The combined shape and continuity cost is minimized using the Viterbi algorithm on features, resulting in improved localization and correspondence. Our algorithm can be generally applied to any feature based shape matching method. Chamfer matching correlates model templates with the distance transform of the edge image. This can be done efficiently using a coarse-to-fine search over the transformation parameters. The method is robust in clutter, however, multiple templates are needed to handle scale, rotation and shape variation. We compare both methods for locating hand shapes in cluttered images, and applied to word recognition in EZ-Gimpy images."

The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The Gaussian, distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through rain and snow."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of datasets."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."
