Concurrent with its second incarnation in 2011, a continuous effort started to develop an on-line framework to facilitate the hosting and management of competitions. This paper outlines the Robust Reading Competition Annotation and Evaluation Platform, the backbone of the competitions. The RRC Annotation and Evaluation Platform is a modular framework, fully accessible through on-line interfaces. It comprises a collection of tools and services for managing all processes involved with defining and evaluating a research task, from dataset definition to annotation management, evaluation specification and results analysis. Although the framework has been designed with robust reading research in mind, many of the provided tools are generic by design. All aspects of the RRC Annotation and Evaluation Framework are available for research use."

There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008\u20132012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community\u2019s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges."

To take timely preventive and control measures, early and rapid detection of JE RNA is necessary. But due to characteristic brief and low viraemia, JE RNA detection remains challenging. In this study, a real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (RT-NASBA) was developed for rapid and simultaneous detection of JEV. Four pairs of primer were designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains from GenBank. NASBA assay established and optimal reaction conditions were confirmed by using primers and probe on ns1 gene of JEV. The specificity and sensitivity of the assay were compared with RT-PCR by using serial RNA and virus cultivation dilutions. The results showed that JEV RT-NASBA assay was established, and robust signals could be observed in 10\u202fmin with high specificity. The limit of dectetion of RT-NASBA was 6 copies per reaction. The assay was thus 100 to 1, 000 times more sensitive than RT-PCR. The cross-reaction was performed with other porcine pathogens, and negative amplification results indicated the high specificity of this method. The novel JEV RT-NASBA assay could be used as an efficient molecular biology tool to diagnose JEV, which would facilitate the surveillance of reproductive failure disease in swine and would be beneficial for public health security."
