                "text": "World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured hypertext documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables project is an effort to extract and make use of the huge number of these structured tables on the Web. A clean collection of relational-style ta- bles could be useful for improving web search, schema de- sign, and many other applications. This paper describes the first stage of the WebTables project. First, we give an in-depth study of the Web's HTML table corpus. For example, we extracted 14.1 billion HTML ta- bles from a several-billion-page portion of Google's general- purpose web crawl, and estimate that 154 million of these tables contain high-quality relational-style data. We also de- scribe the crawl's distribution of table sizes and data types. Second, we describe a system for performing relation recov- ery. The Web mixes relational and non-relational tables indiscriminately (often on the same page), so there is no simple way to distinguish the 1.1% of good relations from the remainder, nor to recover column label and type infor- mation. Our mix of hand-written detectors and statistical classifiers takes a raw Web crawl as input, and generates a collection of databases that is five orders of magnitude larger than any other collection we are aware of. Relation recovery achieves precision and recall that are comparable to other domain-independent information extraction systems."

                "text": "The World-Wide Web consists not only of a huge number of unstructured texts, but also a vast amount of valuable structured data. Web tables [2] are a typical type of structured information that are pervasive on the web, and Web-scale methods that automatically extract web tables have been studied extensively [1]. Many powerful systems (e.g.OCTOPUS [4], Mesa [3]) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component.\n In the database vernacular, a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes. Similarly, a web table is defined as a set of rows (corresponding to database tuples) which have the same column headers (corresponding to database attributes). Therefore, to extract a web table is to extract a relation on the web. In databases, tables often contain foreign keys which refer to other tables. Therefore, it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes function as foreign keys to other relations whose tuples are contained in the hyperlink's target pages. In this paper, we explore this idea by asking: can we discover new attributes for web tables by exploring hyperlinks inside web tables?\n This poster proposes a solution that takes a web table as input. Frequent patterns are generated as new candidate relations by following hyperlinks in the web table. The confidence of candidates are evaluated, and trustworthy candidates are selected to become new attributes for the table. Finally, we show the usefulness of our method by performing experiments on a variety of web domains."

This representation of relational world knowledge is usually considerably better than completely unstructured, free-format text. At the same time, unlike manually-created knowledge bases, relational information mined from \"organic\" Web tables need not be constrained by availability of precious editorial time. Unfortunately, in the absence of any formal, uniform schema imposed on Web tables, Web search cannot take advantage of these high-quality sources of relational information. In this paper we propose new machine learning techniques to annotate table cells with entities that they likely mention, table columns with types from which entities are drawn for cells in the column, and relations that pairs of table columns seek to express. We propose a new graphical model for making all these labeling decisions for each table simultaneously, rather than make separate local decisions for entities, types and relations. Experiments using the YAGO catalog, DB-Pedia, tables from Wikipedia, and over 25 million HTML tables from a 500 million page Web crawl uniformly show the superiority of our approach. We also evaluate the impact of better annotations on a prototype relational Web search tool. We demonstrate clear benefits of our annotations beyond indexing tables in a purely textual manner."

A multitude of different HTML implementations of web tables make these approaches difficult to scale. In this paper, we approach the problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attention from the tree-based representation of webpages to a variation of the two-dimensional visual box model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. The there by obtained topological and style information allows us to fill the gap created by missing domain-specific knowledge about content and table templates. We believe that, in a future step, this approach can become the basis for a new way of large-scale knowledge acquisition from the current \"Visual Web."

We then propose a classification algorithm for automatically detecting a subset of the classes in our taxonomy, namely layout tables and attribute/value tables.

For example, a collection of newspaper articles might contain information on the location of the headquarters of a number of organizations. If we need to nd the location of the headquarters of, say, Microsoft, we could try and use traditional information-retrieval techniques for nding documents that contain the answer to our query. Alternatively, we could answer such a query more precisely if we somehow had available a table listing all the organization-location pairs that are mentioned in our document collection. One could view the extraction process as automatically building a materialized view over the unstructured text data. In this demo we present an interactive prototype of our Snowball system for extracting relations from collections of plain-text documents with minimal human participation. Our method builds on the DIPRE idea introduced by Brin [3]. Our system and techniques were presented in detail in [2] and [1]."

We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved."

While relational database systems offer powerfifl structured query languages such as SQL, there is no support for keyword search over databases. The simplicity of keyword search as a querying paradigm offers compelling values for data exploration. Specifically, keyword search does not require a priori knowledge of the schema. The above is significant as much information in a corporation is increasingly being available at its intranet. However, it is unrealistic to expect users who would browse and query such information to have detailed knowledge of the schema of available databases. Therefore, just as keyword search and classification hierarchies complement each other for document search, keyword search over databases can be effective."

For example, an OIE system might discover the triple Frenzy, year, 1972 from a set of documents about movies. Because OIE is domain-independent, it promises to help users when they have a corpus of structured data, but that structure is unknown, such as when browsing a novel domain or formulating a query. We can describe the structure to the user by displaying a relational schema that fits the extracted data. Unfortunately, the extractions do not carry full schema information: we have extracted values, but not the correct relations, their rows, or their columns. In response we propose TGen, an algorithm for schema discovery, which automatically derives a high-quality relational schema for the extracted data. Different applications have different schema-design requirements, which can be encoded as input to TGen. We show that our data-mining approach runs in minutes on millions of documents while still resulting in schemas that are useful for exploring unfamiliar data or for composing queries over extracted data."

KnowItAll associates a probability with each fact enabling it to trade off precision and recall. The paper analyzes KnowItAll's architecture and reports on lessons learned for the design of large-scale information extraction systems."

The schema is th e means through which we understand and query the underlying data. The schema permits the more sophi ticated structured queries that are not possible over schema-less data. Most systems assume that th e schema is predefined and is an accurate reflection of the data. This assumption is often not valid in n etworked databases that may contain data originating from many sources and may not be valid within leg acy databases where the semantics of data have evolved over time. As a result, querying and tasks that d epend on structured queries (including data integration and schema mapping) may not be effective. I n this paper, we consider the problem of discovering schemas from data. We focus on discovering prop erties of data that can be exploited in querying and transforming data. Finally, we very briefly con sider the suitability of mining approaches to the task of schema discovery."

A person wishing to access data from an unfamiliar database has the daunting task of understanding its schema before being able to pose a correct query against it. A schema summary can be of great help, providing a succinct overview of the entire schema, and making it possible to explore in depth only the relevant schema components.In this paper we formally define a schema summary and two desirable properties (in addition to minimizing size) of a summary: presenting important schema elements and achieving broad information coverage. We develop algorithms that allow us to automatically generate schema summaries based on these two goals. We further develop an objective metric for assessing the quality of a schema summary using query information. Experimental evaluation using this metric demonstrates that the summaries produced by our algorithms can significantly reduce the amount of user effort required to formulate a query through schema exploration."

Our system is designed to load unstructured records into columns spread across multiple tables in the database while resolving the relationship of the extracted text with existing column values, and preserving the cardinality and link constraints of the database.

We present a system for discovering data dependencies, which is build upon a set\u2013oriented interface. The point of main effort has been put on the discovery of domain restrictions,unary inclusionand functional dependencies in relational databases.

A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically find such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy."

                "text": "Schema matching is the problem of identifying corresponding elements in different schemas. Discovering these correspondences or matches is inherently difficult to automate. Past solutions have proposed a principled combination of multiple algorithms. However, these solutions sometimes perform rather poorly due to the lack of sufficient evidence in the schemas being matched. In this paper we show how a corpus of schemas and mappings can be used to augment the evidence about the schemas being matched, so they can be matched better. Such a corpus typically contains multiple schemas that model similar concepts and hence enables us to learn variations in the elements and their properties. We exploit such a corpus in two ways. First, we increase the evidence about each element being matched by including evidence from similar elements in the corpus. Second, we learn statistics about elements and their relationships and use them to infer constraints that we use to prune candidate mappings. We also describe how to use known mappings to learn the importance of domain and generic constraints. We present experimental results that demonstrate corpus-based matching outperforms direct matching (without the benefit of a corpus) in multiple domains."

In this paper, we investigate algorithms for generic schema matching, outside of any particular data model or application. We first present a taxonomy for past solutions, showing that a rich range of techniques is available. We then propose a new algorithm, Cupid, that discovers mappings between schema elements based on their names, data types, constraints, and schema structure, using a broader set of techniques than past approaches. Some of our innovations are the integrated use of linguistic and structural matching, context-dependent matching of shared types, and a bias toward leaf structure where much of the schema content resides. After describing our algorithm, we present experimental results that compare Cupid to two other schema matching systems."

The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)."

Hence many recent works have focused on automating the matching process. To date, however, virtually all of these works deal only with one-to-one (1-1) matches, such as address = location. They do not consider the important class of more complex matches, such as address = concat (city, state) and room-pric = room-rate* (1 + tax-rate).We describe the iMAP system which semi-automatically discovers both 1-1 and complex matches. iMAP reformulates schema matching as a search in an often very large or infinite match space. To search effectively, it employs a set of searchers, each discovering specific types of complex matches. To further improve matching accuracy, iMAP exploits a variety of domain knowledge, including past complex matches, domain integrity constraints, and overlap data. Finally, iMAP introduces a novel feature that generates explanation of predicted matches, to provide insights into the matching process and suggest actions to converge on correct matches quickly. We apply iMAP to several real-world domains to match relational tables, and show that it discovers both 1-1 and complex matches with high accuracy."

In current implementations, schema matching is typically performed manually, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, previous research papers have proposed many techniques to achieve a partial automation of the match operation for specific application domains. We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular, we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover. We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component."

Inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence in general.

These dependencies are usually determined from the semantics of the attributes and are then enforced upon the relations.

The proposed algorithm is an application of the technique we designed for learning conditional independencies in probabilistic reasoning. A prototype system for automated database schema design has been implemented.

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."
