                "text": "Recognition systems attempt to recover information about the identity of observed objects and their location in the environment. A fundamental problem in recognition is pose estimation. This is the problem of using a correspondence between some portions of an object model and some portions of an image to determine whether the image contains an instance of the object, and, in case it does, to determine the transformation that relates the model to the image. The current approaches to this problem are divided into methods that use \u201cglobal\u201d properties of the object (e.g., centroid and moments of inertia) and methods that use \u201clocal\u201d properties of the object (e.g., corners and line segments). Global properties are sensitive to occlusion and, specifically, to self occlusion. Local properties are difficult to locate reliably, and their matching involves intensive computation.We present a novel method for recognition that uses region information. In our approach the model and the image are divided into regions. Given a match between subsets of regions (without any explicit correspondence between different pieces of the regions) the alignment transformation is computed. The method applies to planar objects under similarity, affine, and projective transformations and to projections of 3-D objects undergoing affine and projective transformations. The new approach combines many of the advantages of the previous two approaches, while avoiding some of their pitfalls. Like the global methods, our approach makes use of region information that reflects the true shape of the object. But like local methods, our approach can handle occlusion."

This technique is an extension of our earlier work (1996) on object recognition using matching of multi-dimensional receptive field histograms. In the earlier paper we have shown that multi-dimensional receptive field histograms can be matched to provide object recognition which is robust in the face of changes in viewing position and independent of image plane rotation and scale. In this paper we extend this method to compute the probability of the presence of an object in an image. The paper begins with a review of the method and previously presented experimental results. We then extend the method for histogram matching to obtain a genuine probability of the presence of an object. We present experimental results on a database of 100 objects showing that the approach is capable recognizing all objects correctly by using only a small portion of the image. Our results show that receptive field histograms provide a technique for object recognition which is robust, has low computational cost and a computational complexity which is linear with the number of pixels."

The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"

When model databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered scenes in just a few seconds."

                "text": "Abstract A model of recognition is described based on cell properties in the ventral cortical stream of visual processing in the primate brain. At a critical intermediate stage in this system, \u2018Elaborate\u2019 feature sensitive cells respond selectively to visual features in a way that depends on size (\u00b1 1 octave), orientation (\u00b1 4 5 \u00b0) but does not depend on position within central vision (\u00b1 5 \u00b0). These features are simple conjunctions of 2-D elements (e.g. a horizontal dark area above a dark smoothly convex area). They can arise either as elements of an object\u2019s surface pattern or as a 3-D component bounded by an object\u2019s external contour. By requiring a combination of several such features without regard to their position within the central region of the visual image, \u2018Pattern\u2019 sensitive cells at higher levels can exhibit selectivity for complex configurations that typify objects seen under particular viewing conditions. Given that input features to such Pattern sensitive cells are specified in approximate size and orientation, initial cellular \u2018representations\u2019 of the visual appearance of object type (or object example) are also selective for orientation and size. At this level, sensitivity to object view (\u00b1 6 0 \u00b0) arises because visual features disappear as objects are rotated in perspective. Processing is thus viewer-centred and the neurones only respond to objects seen from particular viewing conditions or \u2018object instances\u2019. Combined sensitivity to multiple features (conjunctions of elements) independent of their position, establishes selectivity for the configurations of object parts (from one view) because rearranged configurations of the same parts yield images lacking some of the 2-D visual features present in the normal configuration. Different neural populations appear to be selectively tuned to particular components of the same biological object (e.g. face, eyes, hands, legs), perhaps because the independent articulation of these components gives rise to correlated activity in different sets of input visual features. Generalisation over viewing conditions for a given object can be established by hierarchically pooling outputs of view-condition specific cells with pooling operations dependent on the continuity in experience across viewing conditions. Different object parts are seen together and different views are seen in succession when the observer walks around the object. The view specific coding that characterises the selectivity of cells in the temporal lobe can be seen as a natural consequence of selective experience of objects from particular vantage points. View specific coding for the face and body also has great utility in understanding complex social signals, a property that may not be feasible with object-centred processing."

This representation is constructed by detecting peaks and ridges in the difference of lowpass (DOLP) transform. Descriptions of shapes which are encoded in this representation may be matched efficiently despite changes in size, orientation, or position. Motivations for a multiple resolution representation are presented first, followed by the definition of the DOLP transform. Techniques are then presented for encoding a symbolic structural description of forms from the DOLP transform. This process involves detecting local peaks and ridges in each bandpass image and in the entire three-dimensional space defined by the DOLP transform. Linking adjacent peaks in different bandpass images gives a multiple resolution tree which describes shape. Peaks which are local maxima in this tree provide landmarks for aligning, manipulating, and matching shapes. Detecting and linking the ridges in each DOLP bandpass image provides a graph which links peaks within a shape in a bandpass image and describes the positions of the boundaries of the shape at multiple resolutions. Detecting and linking the ridges in the DOLP three-space describes elongated forms and links the largest peaks in the tree. The principles for determining the correspondence between symbols in pairs of such descriptions are then described. Such correspondence matching is shown to be simplified by using the correspondence at lower resolutions to constrain the possible correspondence at higher resolutions."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

To reveal neuronal mechanisms of this invariance, we recorded activities from single cells in the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), determined the critical features for the activation of individual cells, and examined the effects of changes in stimulus size and position on the responses. 2. Twenty-one percent of the anterior IT cells studied here responded to ranges of size > 4 octaves, whereas 43% responded to size ranges < 2 octaves. The optimal stimulus size, measured by the distance between the outer edges along the longest axis of the stimulus, ranged from 1.7 to 30 degrees. 3. The selectivity for shape was mostly preserved over the entire range of effective size and over the receptive field, whereas some subtle but statistically significant changes were observed in one half of the cells studied here. 4. The size-specific responses observed in 43% of the cells are consistent with recent psychophysical data that suggest that images of objects are stored in a size-specific manner in the long-term memory. Both size-dependent and -independent processing of images may occur in anterior IT."

Using a pose clustering technique, the method determines the pose of an object and the object type itself. We have implemented the method and verified its validity."
