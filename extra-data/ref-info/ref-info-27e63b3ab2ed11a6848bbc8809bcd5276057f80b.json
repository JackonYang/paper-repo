Due to the recent spread of digital imaging devices, the demand for image recognition of various kinds of real world scenes becomes greater. For realizing it, visual knowledge on various kinds of scenes is required. Then, we propose gathering visual knowledge on real world scenes for generic image classification from the World-Wide Web. Our system gathers a large number of images from the Web automatically and makes use of them as training images for generic image classification. It consists of three modules, which are an image-gathering module, an image-learning module and an image classification module. The image-gathering module gathers images related to given class keywords from the Web automatically. The learning module extracts image features from gathered images and associates them with each class. The image classification module classifies an unknown image into one of the classes corresponding to the class keywords by using the association between image features and classes. In the experiments, we achieved a classification rate 44.6% for generic images by using images gathered from the World-Wide Web automatically as training images."

In this paper, we propose a multi-level approach to annotate the semantics of <b><i>natural scenes</i></b> by using both the dominant image components (salient objects) and the relevant semantic concepts. To achieve automatic image annotation at the content level, we use salient objects as the dominant image components for image content representation and feature extraction. To support automatic image annotation at the concept level, a novel image classification technique is developed to map the images into the most relevant semantic image concepts. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to learn the detection functions for the pre-defined salient objects and finite mixture models are used for semantic concept interpretation and modeling. An <b><i>adaptive EM algorithm</i></b> has been proposed to determine the optimal model structure and model parameters simultaneously. We have also demonstrated that our algorithms are very effective to enable multi-level annotation of <b><i>natural scenes</i></b> in a large-scale image dataset."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

In this paper, we introduce a statistical modeling approach to this problem. Categorized images are used to train a dictionary of hundreds of statistical models each representing a concept. Images of any given concept are regarded as instances of a stochastic process that characterizes the concept. To measure the extent of association between an image and the textual description of a concept, the likelihood of the occurrence of the image based on the characterizing stochastic process is computed. A high likelihood indicates a strong association. In our experimental implementation, we focus on a particular group of stochastic processes, that is, the two-dimensional multiresolution hidden Markov models (2D MHMMs). We implemented and tested our ALIP (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures) system on a photographic image database of 600 different concepts, each with about 40 training images. The system is evaluated quantitatively using more than 4,600 images outside the training database and compared with a random annotation scheme. Experiments have demonstrated the good accuracy of the system and its high potential in linguistic indexing of photographic images."

This method, which we refer to as JSEG, consists of two independent steps: color quantization and spatial segmentation. In the first step, colors in the image are quantized to several representative classes that can be used to differentiate regions in the image. The image pixels are then replaced by their corresponding color class labels, thus forming a class-map of the image. The focus of this work is on spatial segmentation, where a criterion for \"good\" segmentation using the class-map is proposed. Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results in the \"J-image,\" in which high and low values correspond to possible boundaries and interiors of color-texture regions. A region growing method is then used to segment the image based on the multiscale J-images. A similar approach is applied to video sequences. An additional region tracking scheme is embedded into the region growing process to achieve consistent segmentation and tracking results, even for scenes with nonrigid object motion. Experiments show the robustness of the JSEG algorithm on real images and video."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

These processes lead to results which show that each sub-image can be correlated to a set of words each of which is selected from words assigned to whole images. Original aspects of the method are, (1) all words assigned to a whole image are inherited to each divided sub-image, (2) the voting probability of each word for a set of divided images is estimated by the result of a vector quantization of the feature vector of sub-images.
