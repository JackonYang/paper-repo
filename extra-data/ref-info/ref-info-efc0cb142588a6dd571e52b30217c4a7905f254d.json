After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

This paper presents an in-depth experimental study on pedestrian classification; multiple feature-classifier combinations are examined with respect to their ROC performance and efficiency. We investigate global versus local and adaptive versus nonadaptive features, as exemplified by PCA coefficients, Haar wavelets, and local receptive fields (LRFs). In terms of classifiers, we consider the popular support vector machines (SVMs), feedforward neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor classifier. Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques. Our experiments show that the novel combination of SVMs with LRF features performs best. A boosted cascade of Haar wavelets can, however, reach quite competitive results, at a fraction of computational cost. The data set used in this paper is made public, establishing a benchmark for this important problem"

Instead of traditional concatenation-style image location-based feature encoding, a global descriptor more invariant to pose variation is introduced. Specifically, we propose a principled approach to learning and classifying human/non-human image patterns by simultaneously segmenting human shapes and poses, and extracting articulation-insensitive features. The shapes and poses are segmented by an efficient, probabilistic hierarchical part-template matching algorithm, and the features are collected in the context of poses by tracing around the estimated shape boundaries. Histograms of oriented gradients are used as a source of low-level features from which our pose-invariant descriptors are computed, and kernel SVMs are adopted as the test classifiers. We evaluate our detection and segmentation approach on two public pedestrian datasets."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

Mikolajczyk and Schmid (June 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified the SIFT [D. G. Lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image deformations. This paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by SIFT. Like SIFT, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using SIFT's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to the normalized gradient patch. Our experiments demonstrate that the PCA-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard SIFT representation. We also present results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching."

In the last decade, discriminative learning approaches have proven effective in detecting rigid objects, achieving very low false positives rates. The field has also seen a resurgence of part-based recognition methods, with impressive results on highly articulated, diverse object categories. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning approach for detection that is inspired by part-based recognition approaches. Our method, Multiple Component Learning (mcl), automatically learns individual component classifiers and combines these into an overall classifier. Unlike previous methods, which rely on either fairly restricted part models or labeled part data, mcl learns powerful component classifiers in a weakly supervised manner, where object labels are provided but part labels are not. The basis of mcl lies in learning a set classifier; we achieve this by combining boosting with weakly supervised learning, specifically the Multiple Instance Learning framework (mil). mcl is general, and we demonstrate results on a range of data from computer audition and computer vision. In particular, mcl outperforms all existing methods on the challenging INRIA pedestrian detection dataset, and unlike methods that are not part-based, mcl is quite robust to occlusions."

Responses of part detectors are combined to form a joint likelihood model that includes cases of multiple, possibly inter-occluded humans. The human detection problem is formulated as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.

However, to our best knowledge no previous work has focused on utilizing local patterns for the task of human detection. In this paper we develop a novel human detection system in personal albums based on LBP (local binary pattern) descriptor. Firstly we review the existing gradient based local features widely used in human detection, analyze their limitations and argue that LBP is more discriminative. Secondly, original LBP descriptor does not suit the human detecting problem well due to its high complexity and lack of semantic consistency, thus we propose two variants of LBP: Semantic-LBP and Fourier-LBP. Carefully designed experiments demonstrate the superiority of LBP over other traditional features for human detection. Especially we adopt a random ensemble algorithm for better comparison between different descriptors. All experiments are conducted on INRIA human database."

Different resolutions are represented using a coarse-to-fine feature hierarchy. During detection, the lower resolution features are initially used to reject the majority of negative windows at relatively low cost, leaving a relatively small number of windows to be processed in higher resolutions. This enables the use of computationally more expensive higher resolution features to achieve high detection accuracy. We applied this framework on Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features for object detection. Our multi-resolution detector produced better performance for pedestrian detection than state-of-the-art methods (Dalal and Triggs, 2005), and was faster during both training and testing. Testing our method on motorbikes and cars from the VOC database revealed similar improvements in both speed and accuracy, suggesting that our approach is suitable for realtime general object detection applications."

The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space.

We use gradient-based local descriptors and we combine them to form strong classifiers organized in a cascaded detector. We compare the original AdaBoost algorithm with two other boosting algorithms we developed. One optimizes the use of each selected descriptor to minimize the operations done in the image (method 1), leading to an acceleration of the detection process without any loss in detection performances. The second algorithm (method 2) improves the selection of the descriptors by associating to each of them a more powerful weak-learner - a decision tree built from the components of the whole descriptor - and by evaluating them locally. We compare the results of these three learning algorithms on a reference database of color images and we then introduce our preliminary results on the adaptation of this detector on infrared vision. Our methods give better detection rates and faster processing than the original boosting algorithm and also provide interesting results for further studies."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

We propose a framework to optimize the discrimination-efficiency tradeoff in integrating multiple, heterogeneous features for object detection. Cascade structured detectors are learned by boosting local feature based weak classifiers. Each weak classifier corresponds to a local image region, from which several different types of features are extracted. The weak classifier makes predictions by examining the features one by one; this classifier goes to the next feature only when the prediction from the already examined features is not confident enough. The order in which the features are evaluated is determined based on their computational cost normalized classification powers. We apply our approach to two object classes, pedestrians and cars. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10-6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy."

Our proposed system integrates robust stereo depth cues, ground-plane estimation, and appearance-based object detection in a principled fashion using a graphical model. Object-object occlusions lead to complex interactions in this model that make an exact solution computationally intractable. We therefore propose a novel iterative approach that first infers scene geometry using belief propagation and then resolves interactions between objects using a global optimization procedure. This approach leads to a robust solution in few iterations, while allowing object detection to benefit from geometry estimation and vice versa. We quantitatively evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on several challenging test sequences showing strolls through busy shopping streets. Comparisons to various baseline systems show that it outperforms both a system using no scene geometry and one just relying on structure-from-motion without dense stereo."

In our approach, both intensity-based rectangle features and gradient-based 1-D features are employed in the feature pool for weak-learner selection. The Real AdaBoost algorithm is used to select critical features from a combined feature set and learn the classifiers from the training images for each stage of the cascaded structure. Instead of using the standard boosted cascade, the proposed method employs a novel cascaded structure that exploits both the stage-wise classification information and the interstage cross-reference information. We introduce meta-stages to enhance the detection performance of a boosted cascade. Experiment results show that the proposed approach achieves high detection accuracy and efficiency."

Specifically, the system integrates continuous visual odometry computation with tracking-by-detection in order to track pedestrians in spite of frequent occlusions and egomotion of the camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions, it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation, and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization. Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable. We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery, allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

In fact, these pedestrian finders make most errors on pedestrians in configurations that are uncommon in the training data, for example, mounting a bicycle. This is undesirable. However, the human configuration can itself be estimated discriminatively using structure learning. We demonstrate a pedestrian finder which first finds the most likely human pose in the window using a discriminative procedure trained with structure learning on a small dataset. We then present features (local histogram of oriented gradient and local PCA of gradient) based on that configuration to an SVM classifier. We show, using the INRIA Person dataset, that estimates of configuration significantly improve the accuracy of a discriminative pedestrian finder."

This paper describes a bilattice based logical reasoning approach that exploits contextual information and knowledge about interactions between humans, and augments it with the output of different low level detectors for human detection. Detections from low level parts-based detectors are treated as logical facts and used to reason explicitly about the presence or absence of humans in the scene. Positive and negative information from different sources, as well as uncertainties from detections and logical rules, are integrated within the bilattice framework. This approach also generates proofs or justifications for each hypothesis it proposes. These justifications (or lack thereof) are further employed by the system to explain and validate, or reject potential hypotheses. This allows the system to explicitly reason about complex interactions between humans and handle occlusions. These proofs are also available to the end user as an explanation of why the system thinks a particular hypothesis is actually a human. We employ a boosted cascade of gradient histograms based detector to detect individual body parts.
