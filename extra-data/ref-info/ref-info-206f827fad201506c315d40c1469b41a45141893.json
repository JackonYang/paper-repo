                "text": "SECO is an efficient engineering realization of a coding-decoding scheme designed to use variable redundancy and feedback in a two-way communication system to increase the rate of information transfer between users connected by a channel having a slowly time-varying capacity. The simultaneous achievement of transmission efficiency and extreme reliability is made possible by the use of sequential coding and decoding over a long constraint span. The decoding computer is designed to detect channel errors with very high probability and to correct as many of these as it can, subject to the current channel condition and decoder state. When a detected error cannot be corrected easily, the decoder stops and uses the feedback channel to request retransmission at a lower information rate. If the information rate is correctly matched to the channel noise, then almost all detected errors are corrected and consequently repeats are requested only rarely. If the channel becomes \"too noisy\" for the decoder, then a repeat is requested with higher probability and the rate is decreased until a correct match is achieved. Conversely, if the decoder is decoding \"too easily\", it requests an increase in rate. An appropriate strategy selects the correct rate and determines when to make a repeat request. In this paper we concentrate on a description of the encoding and decoding processes and their implementation in a digital machine. Although SECO is intended for ultimate use over real communication channels, for reasons of simplicity we concentrate here upon its use in connection with the idealized Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC)."

The encoder permits desired channel input symbol probabilities to be approximated closely. Decoding at the receiver is accomplished with delay n by means of sequential tests on potential transmitted sequences with reject criteria set so that incorrect sequences are likely to be rejected at short lengths and the correct sequence is likely to be accepted. Averaged over a suitably defined ensemble of encoders, the decoding scheme has an average probability of error with an upper limit whose logarithm approaches -nE(R) for large n. E(R) is dependent only on the data rate R . For a channel symmetric at its output with equally likely inputs, the exponent E(R) is optimum for rates greater than a rate called R_{crit} . For such symmetric channels, a computation cutoff rate R_{comp} is defined. For R , the average number of decoding computations does not grow exponentially with n , but algebraically. R_{comp} is also defined for an asymmetric channel. In this case too, the average number of decoding computations grows algebraically with n for R ."

Schemes are considered here in which the receiver prints out one of three symbols (single-null zone reception) or one of four symbols (double-null zone reception). These extra symbols permit the receiver to indicate when the a posteriori probabilities of the two transmitted states are nearly equal. Single-null zone reception is shown to be capable, under optimum conditions, of achieving about one-half of the improvement in information rate theoretically attainable by increasing the number of receiver levels without limit. Double-null reception, which splits the null zone and thereby retains polarity information, offers only a slight additional increase in rate. It affords a significant advantage over single-null reception, though, because it is much less sensitive to variations in null level."

In the absence of prior information about signal amplitude and phase, square-law combination is optimum; the error rate for this combination method has been found. If signal amplitude and phase are exactly known prior to reception of the signal, coherent combination and detection are optimum; at low error probability this yields only a 3-db improvement. Nonoptimum switch diversity yields only slightly less diversity gain than square-law combination. For dual diversity, correlation of the fading on the separate antennas does not give a large loss if the correlation coefficient is moderate. Correlated noise yields a similar small loss."

The observer must decide which of the signals is present with a minimum probability of error. The optimum system for this decision is specified in terms of filters matched to the two signals, the outputs of which are compared. The error probability is exhibited as a function of the cross-correlation of the two signals and of the signal-to-noise ratio. If the phases of the two signals are unknown, as in radar, and if the signals are of equal strength and equal a priori probability, the optimum system consists of filters matched to each of the signals, each followed by a detector. The observer then bases his decision upon which of the detectors has the larger output. The probability of error is computed for this case also."
