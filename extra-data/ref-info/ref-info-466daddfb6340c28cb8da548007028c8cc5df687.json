The advantage of this method consists in the fact that the successive iterations are constantly employed with maximum efficiency which guarantees fastest convergence for a given number of iterations. Moreover, with the proper care the accumulation of rounding errors can be avoided. The resulting high precision is of great advantage if the separation of closely bunched eigenvalues and eigenvectors is demanded [16]. It was pointed out in [14, p. 256] that the inversion of a matrix, and thus the solution of simultaneous systems of linear equations, is contained in the general procedure as a special case. However, in view of the great importance associated with the solution of large systems of linear equations, this problem deserved more than passing attention. It is the purpose of the present discussion to adopt the general principles of the previous investigation to the specific demands that arise if we are not interested in the complete analysis of a matrix but only in the more special problem of obtaining the solution of a given set of linear equations"

By \u201crelaxation\u201d is meant every \u201cstep-by-step procedure\u201d for solving systems of linear equations based on minimizing quadratic forms. After a short discussion of the trial methods developed bySouthwell and his school, allowing full leeway to the intuition of the computing person, the general mathematical background is treated. \u00a7 3, 4 are the central parts of the paper. After a study of the gradient method it is shown that relaxation methods are not necessarily successive approximations taking an infinite number of steps but that it is possible to speed up convergence such that the desired result is reached in a finite number of steps. These methods may be suitable for use on sequence-controlled computing machines. Special consideration is given to the well-known fact that relaxation very quickly smoothes the trial function but that it may be a combersome task to get rid of the remaining smooth residual distribution."

Resistance transforms the wavefront from a characteristic curve into an envelope of characteristics. The flow near the tip differs from the other parts, due to a distinct boundary-layer type of region adjacent to the wavefront envelope. Then a perturbation leads to a system of partial differential equations with variable coefficients. Initial conditions are derived for the singularity at the origin. By studying its characteristic equations, this system is solved explicitly for the correction functions. Except at the tip, resistance raises the water surface and lowers velocities. These functions, no longer simple-waves, possess concurrent straight characteristic lines that map into another set of the same type. The critical flow locus moves downstream, faster for more resistance, and discharge rates are reduced. The method fails in the tip layer because the asymptotic expansions for the first derivatives lose validity there. Estimates are made indirectly for the wavefront velocity by observing where the boundary-layer effect becomes predominant."

                "text": "The viscosities of solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate of concentrations up to 0.8 percent in distilled water and in 0.01- to 0.12-Af sodium chloride have been measured. By introducing the concept of a monomer saturation concentration it is possible to determine the intrinsic viscosity of the micelles at each concentration of sodium chloride. A method for the experimental determination of the monomer saturation concentration is presented. The dependence of the intrinsic viscosity on the salt concentration is discussed in terms of electroviscous and hydration effects. The data indicate the presence of spherical micelles in the solutions investigated. 1- Introduction Since the early experiments of Krafft [I}1 and McBain [2] on soap solutions, and the subsequent interpretation of their results in terms of the existence of micelles in such solutions, many researches [3, 4] have been undertaken to investigate the size and shape of these particles. It is now generally assumed that there are at least two types of micelles. In the concentration range between the onset of micelle formation (about 0.1 to 0.25 percent by weight) and about 1 to 2 percent, a small, highly charged and highly conducting micelle is thought to exist. This type of micelle has been discussed at some length by Hartley [5, 6]. He considered them as spheres, but there has been no general agreement on their shape. A large micelle, haying a structure discernible by X-ray diffraction, exists at higher concentrations (about 10 percent or greater). They have been discussed and investigated by McBain [2], Hess [7], Philippoff [8], and others [9]. Harkins [10] and his coworkers interpret their later X-ray diffraction data for concentrated solutions in terms of cylindrical micelles. Brady [11], however, utilizing a treatment considered by Corrin [12], interprets his data for concentrated sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions in terms of a radial distribution of spherical micelles. Recent light-scattering investigations by Debye [13] indicate that in the presence of high concentrations of electrolyte, the micelles of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide are rodlike. The purpose of this research was to investigate the viscometric behavior of dilute solutions of a pure, well-defined detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate. Detergent concentrations up to 0.8 percent by weight were used. Distilled water and 0.01 to 0.12 M sodium chloride solutions were used as solvents. 2. Materials The' sodium dodecyl sulfate was synthesized, as described by Shedlovsky [14], from a vacuum-distilled sample of n-dodecyl alcohol. The chlorosulfonic acid used in the synthesis was distilled immediately before use. All other reagents used in the synthesis and subsequent purification conformed with Amerii Figures in brackets indicate literature references at the end of this paper. can Chemical Society specifications. Prior to making up solutions for the measurements, the detergent was extracted with diethyl ether for about 8 hr in a Soxhlet extractor. After a measurement, the detergent was recovered from solution in the following manner: The solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue taken up in ethyl alcohol. The alcohol solution was filtered and evaporated to dryness. This residue was then taken up in water and crystallized. Finally, the crystals were extracted with ether."

For each of three presentations of the cubes with respect to light paths, contours of differences in refractive index were drawn at intervals of 5 X 10~. It was found that index variations seldom exceeded \u00b11X1O~ in this annealed glass. From analyses of the data, it was concluded that there need be little, if any, difference in degree of homogeneity, even if the holding temperature during annealing is 30 or 40\u00b0 C above the lowest feasible value."

The purpose of these measurements was to determine the molecular constants of these molecules from their spectra. Using the saturated vapor in a cell 60 centimeters long, it was possible to resolve the fine structure in three to five bands of each molecule. All the resolved bands are overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrations localized in the methylene radical, and hence appear at nearly the same frequencies for each molecule. Bands with Q branches (symmetry types B and C) and without that feature appear. Application of combination relations to all bands of a given molecule yield rotational spacings of the ground state agreeing within 0.5 percent. The spacings, [A\" \u2014 (B\" + C\")I2\\, are, respectively, for CH2C12, 0.955 cm\" ; CH2BrCl, 0.898 cm\" ; and CH2Br2, 0.821 cm. The molecular dimensions cannot be uniquely determined from these data alone, but if tetrahedral angles are assumed, they lead to improbably low values of the C \u2014 halogen distance, namely, 1.70 A for C \u2014Cl and 1.83 A for C \u2014 Br. If the halogen \u2014 C \u2014 halogen angle is increased to 112\u00b0, as found by electron diffraction, the C \u2014 Cl distance is in good agreement with the electron diffraction distance 1.766 A, and C \u2014Br becomes 1.907 A in CH2Br2 and 1.911 in CH2BrCl."

These include seven normal paraffins from methane to heptane; isopentane and isohexane; three pure cyclics and methylcyclohexane; four olefins; three C4F6 isomers; a dicyclic; and a tricyclic. These spectra are very different from the hydrocarbon analogs. In all the paraffins the most abundant ion is CFJ\", and the molecule ions are very small or absent. Spectra of the unsaturated compounds and the cyclics are more distinctive than the normal paraffins. In the paraffins, ions of formula CTCF2n+i tend to be largest, except that when one carbon is removed the largest ion is CnF2n-i. In cyclics, CnF2n-i ions tend to be largest; in the dicyclic, CnF2n-3 ions are largest; and in the tricyclic, CnF2n-5 ions tend to be largest. The tricyclic CsFi2 is probably a fused cyclobutane structure. The dicyclic is completely fluorinated methylnapthalene, CnF20, and is the heaviest compound ever run on the Bureau's mass spectrometer. In the perfluoroparaffins there is a progressive increase in the current per unit pressure for the CFJ ion with increasing molecular weight of the fluorocarbon. In incompletely fluorinated molecules containing an H atom the larger ion peaks containing H will correspond with the larger peaks in the perfluoro spectrum, with H substituted for a fluorine atom."

For the benzoyl peroxide catalyzed polymerization, the induction period is markedly shortened by small quantities of water in the monomer. It is inversely proportional to the water concentration and directly proportional to the hydroquinone content. In the absence of inhibitor it is inversely proportional to the square root of the catalyst concentration. This acceleration effect is caused by the more rapid decomposition of benzoyl peroxide in water-containing monomer, with a subsequent slight increase in free radical concentration, which is sufficient to shorten the induction period. Water in the monomer does not alter appreciably the reaction rate after the induction period."

The shape of the true stress-strain curves obtained on copper cold-drawn 34-, 40-, and 70percent reduction in area indicate a strain aging effect in the specimens when subjected to stresses in the vicinity of the maximum load. This phenomenon of strain aging is usually more closely associated with alloys of the ferrous type than with a high-purity nonferrous metal. The present results show that the strength, ductility, and hardness of the copper is markedly affected by its prior strain history. The test conditions are correlated with the tensile properties, hardness, necking characteristics, formation of microcracks, and substructures."

Isotopic abundances of carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead were obtained from the observed spectra and used to calculate the monoisotopic spectra. The mass spectra of the Group IV tetramethyls are qualitatively similar. The principal ion in each case results from the dissociation of one methyl group. The molecule ion and ions resulting from the dissociation of hydrogen atoms are rare. Hydrides of the atom ions and the mono-, di-, and tri-methyl ions were observed. Some evidence is pointed out for the possible formation of the CH3 + ion and the C2H5+ ion in neopentane as hydrides of the central carbon atom."

The curves for pH and pD response as a function of composition pass through an optimum electrode response that is limited on the low percentage of silica end by poor chemical durability and a strong tendency to devitrify upon reheating the glasses for the purpose of blowing the electrodes. The optimum also falls off on the high-silica end where opalescence appears and the hygro- and deuteroscopicities decrease. * The pH and pD response, hygroscopicity, and deuteroscopicity, as well as the chemical durability in aqueous and deuterium oxide solutions, appear to reflect some of the critical features of the Li2O-SiO2 phase equilibrium diagram, with the optimum electrode response occurring in the composition range in which tridymite is the primary phase. Indices of refraction and expansion data for these Li2O-SiO2 glasses exhibit breaks at the same compositions indicated by the physicochemical properties."
