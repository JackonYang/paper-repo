Extended Kalman filters have commonly been applied to kinematic variables, to combine predictions consistent with plausible motion, with the incoming stream of visual measurements. Kalman filtering is applicable only when the underlying distribution is approximately Gaussian. Often this assumption proves remarkably robust. There are two pervasive circumstances under which the Gaussianity assumption can break down. The first is kinematic singularity and the second is at joint endstops. Failure of Kalman filtering under these circumstances is illustrated. The non-Gaussian nature of the distributions is demonstrated experimentally by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Random simulation (particle filtering or Condensation) proves to provide a robust alternative algorithm for tracking that can also deal with these difficult conditions."

Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion.

A central problem in analyzing such movements is due to the fact that the human body consists of body parts linked to each other at joints which allows different movements of the parts. Therefore, the human body generally has to be treated as a nonrigid or more precisely as an articulated body. In addition, for general camera positions always some of the body parts are occluded. Although occlusions can provide important cues in a recognition task, the automatic interpretation is more difficult. Another problem that has to be dealt with is the clothing which can have a large influence on the appearence of a person (wide or tight trousers, different jackets, etc.). Clothing can also cause complex illumination phenomena that, in addition, change during movement (compare with efforts in the field of computer graphics to simulate cloth objects, e.g., [83])."

                "text": "Three dimensional kinematic models are widely-used in video-based figure tracking. We show that these models can suffer from singularities when motion is directed along the viewing axis of a single camera. The single camera case is important because it arises in many interesting applications, such as motion capture from movie footage. We describe a novel 2-D Scaled Prismatic Model (SPM) for figure registration. In contrast to 3-D kinematic models, the SPM has fewer singularity problems and does not require detailed knowledge of the 3-D kinematics. We fully characterize the singularities in the SPM and demonstrate tracking through singularities using synthetic and real examples. We demonstrate the application of our model to motion capture from movies. Fred Astaire is tracked in a clip from the film \u201cShall We Dance\u201d. Some simple video edits are presented. These results demonstrate the benefits of the SPM in tracking with a single source of video. Rehg is with the Cambridge Research Laboratory.

In fact this technique can reduce the curse of dimensionality in other situations too. This paper describes how to use partitioned sampling on articulated objects, obtaining results that would be impossible with standard sampling methods. Because partitioned sampling is the statistical analogue of a hierarchical search, it makes sense to use it on articulated objects, since links at the base of the object can be localised before moving on to search for subsequent links."

Using image sequences acquired simultaneously from multiple views, we recover the 3-D body pose at each time instant without the use of markers. The pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails finding the pose parameters of a graphical human model whose synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. The models used for this purpose are acquired from the images. We use a decomposition approach and a best-first technique to search through the high dimensional pose parameter space. A robust variant of chamfer matching is used as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. We present initial tracking results from a large new Humans-in-Action (HIA) database containing more than 2500 frames in each of four orthogonal views. They contain subjects involved in a variety of activities, of various degrees of complexity, ranging from the more simple one-person hand waving to the challenging two-person close interaction in the Argentine Tango."

In this approach, a sequence containing a large number of frames is used to extract motion information. The advantage is that a longer sequence leads to recognition of higher level motions, like walking or running, which consist of a complex and coordinated series of events. Unlike much previous research in motion, this approach does not require explicit reconstruction of shape from the images prior to recognition. This book provides the state-of-the-art in this rapidly developing discipline. It consists of a collection of invited chapters by leading researchers in the world covering various aspects of motion-based recognition including lipreading, gesture recognition, facial expression recognition, gait analysis, cyclic motion detection, and activity recognition. Audience: This volume will be of interest to researchers and post- graduate students whose work involves computer vision, robotics and image processing."

However, to facilitate sequential inference (e.g. over time or scale) and to allow the representation of ambiguity, it is desirable to represent an entire probability distribution for object location. Although the cross correlation itself (or some function of it) has sometimes been treated as a probability distribution, this is not generally justifiable. Bayesian correlation achieves a consistent probabilistic treatment by combining several developments. The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions in probabilistic terms, as observation likelihoods. Second, probability distributions of filter bank responses are learned from training examples. Inescapably, response learning also demands statistical modelling of background intensities, and there are links here with image coding and Independent Component Analysis. Lastly, multi scale processing is achieved in a Bayesian context by means of a new algorithm, layered sampling, for which asymptotic properties are derived."

Conditions under which the numerical approximation converges almost surely to the true value with the number of Monte Carlo replications, and its numerical accuracy may be assessed reliably, are given. Importance sampling densities are derived from multivariate normal or student approximations to the posterior density. These densities are modified by automatic rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling density. Applications in two illustrative models are presented.
