Current use of language in games, however, is limited to menu systems and inter-player communication. To achieve smooth linguistic communication with synthetic agents, research should focus on how language connects to the situation in which it occurs. Taking account of the physical scene (where is the speaker located, what is around her, when does she speak?) as well as the functional aspects of the situation (why did he choose to speak? What are his likely plans?) can disambiguate the linguistic signal in form and content. We present a game environment to collect time synchronized speech and action streams, to visualize these data and to annotate them at different stages of processing. We further sketch a framework for situated speech understanding on such data, taking into account aspects of the physical situation as well as the plans players follow. Our results show that this combination of influences achieves remarkable improvements over the individual situation models despite the very noisy and spontaneous nature of the speech involved. This work provides a basis for developing characters that use situated natural spoken language to communicate meaningfully with human players."

A simulated agent is trained by an informant giving labels to the agent's actions (here hand motions) and the system learns to both label and carry out similar actions. Computationally, the system employs a novel form of active representation and is explicitly intended to be neurally plausible. The learning methodology is a version of Bayesian model merging (Omohundro, 1992). The verb learning model is placed in the broader context of the L0 project on embodied natural language and its acquisition."

There are two technical problems involved: (1) the correspondence problem in symbol grounding - how to associate words (symbols) with their perceptually grounded meanings from multiple cooccurrences between words and objects in the physical environment. (2) object learning - how to recognize and categorize visual objects. We argue that those two problems can be fundamentally simplified by considering them in a general system and incorporating the spatio-temporal and cross-modal constraints of multimodal data. The system collects egocentric data including image sequences as well as speech while users perform natural tasks. It is able to automatically infer the meanings of object names from vision, and categorize objects based on teaching signals potentially encoded in speech. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal the effectiveness of using multimodal data and integrating heterogeneous techniques in machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision."

Training data consists of natural language sentences annotated with multiple potential meaning representations, only one of which is correct. Such ambiguous supervision models the type of supervision that can be more naturally available to language-learning systems. Given such weak supervision, our approach produces a semantic parser that maps sentences into meaning representations. An existing semantic parsing learning system that can only learn from unambiguous supervision is augmented to handle ambiguous supervision. Experimental results show that the resulting system is able to cope up with ambiguities and learn accurate semantic parsers."

Unfortunately, evaluation has not been a very powerful tool in machine translation (MT) research because it requires human judgments and is thus expensive and time-consuming and not easily factored into the MT research agenda. However, at the July 2001 TIDES PI meeting in Philadelphia, IBM described an automatic MT evaluation technique that can provide immediate feedback and guidance in MT research. Their idea, which they call an \"evaluation understudy\", compares MT output with expert reference translations in terms of the statistics of short sequences of words (word N-grams). The more of these N-grams that a translation shares with the reference translations, the better the translation is judged to be. The idea is elegant in its simplicity. But far more important, IBM showed a strong correlation between these automatically generated scores and human judgments of translation quality. As a result, DARPA commissioned NIST to develop an MT evaluation facility based on the IBM work. This utility is now available from NIST and serves as the primary evaluation measure for TIDES MT research."

Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing."

                "text": "We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."
