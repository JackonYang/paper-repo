The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire and represents an improvement over his results, The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant\u2032s polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances."

However, the algorithm discussed here depends on having a large supply of independent training samples. We show how to circumvent this problem and generate an ensemble of learning machines whose performance in optical character recognition problems is dramatically improved over that of a single network. We report the effect of boosting on four databases (all handwritten) consisting of 12,000 digits from segmented ZIP codes from the United State Postal Service (USPS) and the following from the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST): 220,000 digits, 45,000 upper case alphas, and 45,000 lower case alphas. We use two performance measures: the raw error rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required to achieve a 1% error rate on the patterns not rejected. Boosting improved performance in some cases by a factor of three."

We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

                "text": "There has long been a chasm between theoretical models of machine learning and practical machine learning algorithms. For instance, empirically successful algorithms such as C4:5 and backpropagation have not met the criteria of the PAC model and its variants. Conversely, the algorithms suggested by computational learning theory are usually too limited in various ways to nd wide application. The theoretical status of decision tree learning algorithms is a case in point: while it has been proven that C4:5 (and all reasonable variants of it) fails to meet the PAC model criteria [2], other recently proposed decision tree algorithms that do have non-trivial performance guarantees unfortunately require membership queries [6, 13]. Two recent developments have narrowed this gap between theory and practice|not for the PAC model, but for the related model known as weak learning or boosting . First, an algorithm called Adaboost was proposed that meets the formal criteria of the boosting model and is also competitive in practice [10]. Second, the basic algorithms underlying the popular C4:5 and CART programs have also very recently been shown to meet the formal criteria of the boosting model [12]. Thus, it seems plausible that the weak learning framework may provide a setting for interaction between formal analysis and machine learning practice that is lacking in other theoretical models. Our aim in this paper is to push this interaction further in light of these recent developments. In particular, we perform experiments suggested by the formal results for Adaboost and C4:5 within the weak learning framework. We concentrate on two particularly intriguing issues. First, the theoretical boosting results for top-down decision tree algorithms such as C4:5 [12] suggest that a new splitting criterion may result in trees that are smaller and more accurate than those obtained using the usual information gain. We con rm this suggestion experimentally. Second, a super cial interpretation of the theoretical results suggests that Adaboost should vastly outperform C4:5. This is not the case in practice, and we argue through experimental results that the theory must be understood in terms of a measure of a boosting algorithm's behavior called its advantage sequence. We compare the advantage sequences for C4:5 and Adaboost in a number of experiments. We nd that these sequences have qualitatively different behavior that explains in large part the discrepancies between empirical performance and the theoretical results. Brie y, we nd that although C4:5 and Adaboost are both boosting algorithms, Adaboost creates successively \\harder\" ltered distributions, while C4:5 creates successively \\easier\" ones, in a sense that will be made precise."

The ensemble algorithms are two versions of boosting and committees of neural networks trained independently. For each of the four algorithms, we experimentally determine the test and training error curves in an optical character recognition (OCR) problem as both a function of training set size and computational cost using three architectures. We show that a single machine is best for small training set size while for large training set size some version of boosting is best. However, for a given computational cost, boosting is always best. Furthermore, we show a surprising result for the original boosting algorithm: namely, that as the training set size increases, the training error decreases until it asymptotes to the test error rate. This has potential implications in the search for better training algorithms."

To study this, the concepts of bias and variance of a classifier are defined. Unstable classifiers can have universally low bias. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions is a variance reducing device. One of the most effective is bagging (Breiman [1996a]) Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire [1995,1996] propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym-arcing) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often missclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more sucessful than bagging in variance reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works."

In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

Our main result is a proof that such algorithms areboostingalgorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top?down algorithms we study will amplify this weaks advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy. The bounds we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on thesplitting criterionused by the top?down algorithm. More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1/2??as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees of size (1/?)O(1/?2?2)and (1/?)O(log(1/?)/?2)(respectively) suffice to drive the error below?. Thus (for example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger bound of (1/?)O(1/?2)which is polynomial in 1/?) is obtained, which is provably optimal for decision tree algorithms. The differing bounds have a natured explanation in terms of concavity properties of the splitting criterion. The primary contribution of this work is in proving that some popular and empirically successful heuristics that are base on first principles meet the criteria of an independently motivated theoretical model."

Both form a set of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances. This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets considered."

Until recently, most researchers looking for an introduction to decision trees turned to Quinlan's seminal 1986 Machine Learning journal article [Quinlan, 1986]. In his new book, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Quinlan has put together a definitive, much needed description of his complete system, including the latest developments.

The NN rule['l-[ \" I assigns an unclassified sample to the same class as the nearest of n stored, correctly classified samples. In other words, given a collection of n reference points, each classified by some external source, a new point is assigned to the same class as its nearest neighbor. The most interesting t)heoretical property of the NN rule is that under very mild regularity assumptions on the underlying statistics, for any metric, and for a variety of loss functions , the large-sample risk incurred is less than twice the Bayes risk. (The Bayes decision rule achieves minimum risk but ,requires complete knowledge of the underlying statistics.) From a practical point of view, however, the NN rule is not a prime candidate for many applications because of the storage requirements it imposes. The CNN rule is suggested as a rule which retains the basic approach of the NN rule without imposing such stringent storage requirements. Before describing the CNN rule we first define the notion of a consistent subset of a sample set. This is a subset which, when used as a stored reference set for the NN rule, correctly classifies all of the remaining points in the sample set. A minimal consistent subset is a consistent subset with a minimum number of elements. Every set has a consistent subset, since every set is trivially a consistent subset of itself. Obviously, every finite set has a minimal consistent subset, although the minimum size is not, in general, achieved uniquely. The CNN rule uses the following algorithm to determine a consistent subset of the original sample set. In general, however, the algorithm will not find a minimal consistent subset. We assume that the original sample set is arranged in some order; then we set up bins called STORE and GRABHAG and proceed as follows. 1) The first sample is placed in STORE. 2) The second sample is classified by the NN rule, using as a reference set the current contents of STORE. (Since STORE has only one point, the classification is trivial at this stage.) If the second sample is classified correctly it is placed in GRABBAG; otherwise it is placed in STORE. 3) Proceeding inductively, the ith sample is classified by the current contents of \u2026"

Quite naturally one does better with more memory. The P~,sym(m) curve for any given value of m follows the P,*(co) line for low values of N, diverges from it for larger values of N, and approaches a nonzero limit P,*(m) as N + co. This behavior is easily explained. Any given machine can \u201cremember\u201d all of the observations for low values of N. Here infinite memory offers no advantages. For larger values of N, a finite-state machine necessarily loses some information and thus does not do so well as one with infinite memory. As N -+ co, Pz sym(m) approaches Pm*(m), the infinite-time lower bound on the probability of error, since from [I] we know that for N = co the optimal machine is symmetric."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."
