We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

                "text": "We present a general example-based framework for detecting objects in static images by components. The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

The input to the algorithm is video data obtained from a camera mounted on the vehicle. In the proposed method, a wavelet transform is computed on the video frames, and multistage template matching is used to determine whether or not a pedestrian is present in the frame. Motion detection and localization is used to reduce the computational requirements. Experimental results are presented for several different video sequences. The results show that this method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in cluttered scenes."

Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

This survey identifies a number of promising applications and provides an overview of recent developments in this domain.
