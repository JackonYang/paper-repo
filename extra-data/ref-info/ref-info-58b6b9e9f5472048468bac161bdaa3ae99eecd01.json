It is argued that such decompositions are often unnatural in the sense that the decomposition takes no regard of the structure of the field and it may happen that the parts are more complicated than the whole. Moreover, such decompositions are not invariant with respect to even small topological deformations of the dimensions or the grey scale of the picture, whereas such deformations do not affect the perceptual structure. We present a method to decompose two-dimensional scalar fields in the following way: the whole is a hierarchically structured superposition of parts, such that these parts are featureless (do not contain local extrema or saddle points). The hierarchical structure can be considered a generative grammar for smooth pictures. The concept is extended towards pictures that are sampled with a collection of graded apertures. We introduce the concept of the aperture spectrum, this construct describes the structure of a picture sampled with any aperture. This kind of description is likely to be important for the analysis of visual functions."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

The influence of the inhomogeneous structure of the visual field and a form of spatial integration are incorporated in the model. A hypothetical density function for the spatial sampling units, which specifies the distribution of these units with respect to both size and location, is described. The density function is compared with anatomical and electrophysiological knowledge of the density of retinal and cortical receptive fields. This density function permits a particularly lucid interpretation in terms of pattern processing. It can be considered as a system that permits simultaneous global and focal views of the surroundings. The density function, together with a schematized adaptation behaviour of single units, and an incoherent summation rule permit us to calculate a measure of the mass response, and consequently the threshold function. Predictions of the model are compared with recently obtained psychophysical data. In particular an explanation is offered for certain invariance properties of spatial contrast detection that seems to possess promising generality."

The hypothesis that the elementary sample apertures are virtually identical except for size, which is augmented with general functional forms for pooling of elementary responses and coding properties for the elementary samples, suffices to derive the phenomenological facts. Because of the division of labor among units of different size, the concept of line-spread function loses a physiologically clear interpretation."

                "text": "Spivak's Comprehensive introduction takes as its theme the classical roots of contemporary differential geometry. Spivak explains his Main Premise (my term) as follows: \"in order for an introduction to differential geometry to expose the geometric aspect of the subject, an historical approach is necessary; there is no point in introducing the curvature tensor without explaining how it was invented and what it has to do with curvature\". His second premise concerns the manner in which the historical material should be presented: \"it is absurdly inefficient to eschew the modern language of manifolds, bundles, forms, etc., which was developed precisely in order to rigorize the concepts of classical differential geometry\". Here, Spivak is addressing \"a dilemma which confronts anyone intent on penetrating the mysteries of differential geometry\". On the one hand, the subject is an old one, dating, as we know it, from the works of Gauss and Riemann, and possessing a rich classical literature. On the other hand, the rigorous and systematic formulations in current use were established relatively recently, after topological techniques had been sufficiently well developed to provide a base for an abstract global theory; the coordinate-free geometric methods of E. Cartan were also a major source. Furthermore, the viewpoint of global structure theory now dominates the subject, whereas differential geometers were traditionally more concerned with the local study of geometric objects. Thus it is possible and not uncommon for a modern geometric education to leave the subject's classical origins obscure. Such an approach can offer the great advantages of elegance, efficiency, and direct access to the most active areas of modern research. At the same time, it may strike the student as being frustratingly incomplete. As Spivak remarks, \"ignorance of the roots of the subject has its price-no one denies that modern formulations are clear, elegant and precise; it's just that it's impossible to comprehend how any one ever thought of them.\" While Spivak's impulse to mediate between the past and the present is a natural one and is by no means unique, his undertaking is remarkable for its ambitious scope. Acting on its second premise, the Comprehensive introduction opens with an introduction to differentiable manifolds; the remaining four volumes are devoted to a geometric odyssey which starts with Gauss and Riemann, and ends with the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern Theorem and characteristic classes. A formidable assortment of topics is included along the way, in which we may distinguish several major historical themes: In the first place, the origins of fundamental geometric concepts are investigated carefully. As just one example, Riemannian sectional curvature is introduced by a translation and close exposition of the text of Riemann's remarkable paper, \u00dcber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde"

The propagation of neuronal excitation in afferent and lateral direction is assumed to be anisotropic.

The time-dependent solution describes f.e. the temporal transmission characteristics for flickering grids in the whole frequency range. The stationary solution contains the spatial transmission characteristics for grids as well as the structure of receptive fields with inhibitory surrounds.
