(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Two algorithms were applied to this belief network: (1) a message-passing algorithm by Pearl for probability updating in multiply connected networks using the method of conditioning; and (2) the Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter algorithm for local probability computations on graphical structures.
