Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Our discussion covers supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very specific prior domain knowledge."

This paper follows up on proposed non-parametric algorithms which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabeled examples. It extends them to function induction algorithms that correspond to the minimization of a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happens to have the form of a Parzen windows regressor. The advantage of the extension is that it allows predicting the label for a new example without having to solve again a linear system of dimension 'n' (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Experiments show that the extension works well, in the sense of predicting a label close to the one that would have been obtained if the test example had been included in the unlabeled set. This relatively efficient function induction procedure can also be used when 'n' is large to approximate the solution by writing it only in terms of a kernel expansion with 'm' Keywords: non-parametric models, classification, regression, semi-supervised learning, modeles non parametriques, classification, regression, apprentissage semi-supervise"

Any efficient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention?This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We first present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassification rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels."

We show that architectures such as convolutional networks are good at learning invariant features, but not always optimal for classification, while Support Vector Machines are good at producing decision surfaces from wellbehaved feature vectors, but cannot learn complicated invariances. We present a hybrid system where a convolutional network is trained to detect and recognize generic objects, and a Gaussian-kernel SVM is trained from the features learned by the convolutional network. Results are given on a large generic object recognition task with six categories (human figures, four-legged animals, airplanes, trucks, cars, and \"none of the above\"), with multiple instances of each object category under various poses, illuminations, and backgrounds. On the test set, which contains different object instances than the training set, an SVM alone yields a 43.3% error rate, a convolutional net alone yields 7.2% and an SVM on top of features produced by the convolutional net yields 5.9%."

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Individuals are then recognized by finding the highest relative probability pair among all pairs that consist of a test image and an image whose identity is known. Our method compares favorably with other methods in the literature. The generative model consists of a single layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors and it has the property that, given a data vector, the true posterior probability distribution over the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or approximation. The weights of the feature detectors are learned by comparing the correlations of pixel intensities and feature activations in two phases: When the network is observing real data and when it is observing reconstructions of real data generated from the feature activations."

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."

This first paper discusses the senses in which there are no a priori distinctions between learning algorithms. (The second paper discusses the senses in which there are such distinctions.) In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are as many targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected OTS error than B as vice versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is anti-cross-validation (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one cannot say: if empirical misclassification rate is low, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of your generalizer is small, and the training set is large, then with high probability your OTS error is small. Other implications for membership queries algorithms and punting algorithms are also discussed."

The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture.

We show that training multi-layer neural networks in which the number of hidden units is learned can be viewed as a convex optimization problem. This problem involves an infinite number of variables, but can be solved by incrementally inserting a hidden unit at a time, each time finding a linear classifier that minimizes a weighted sum of errors."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification tasks."

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces \"stroke detectors\" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."

Under the assumption that the data lie on a submanifold in a high dimensional space, we develop an algorithmic framework to classify a partially labeled data set in a principled manner. The central idea of our approach is that classification functions are naturally defined only on the sub-manifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the Laplace Beltrami operator one produces a basis for a Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the submanifold. To recover such a basis, only unlabeled examples are required. Once a basis is obtained, training can be performed using the labeled data set. Our algorithm models the manifold using the adjacency graph for the data and approximates the Laplace Beltrami operator by the graph Laplacian. Practical applications to image and text classification are considered."

While regular Support Vector Machines (SVMs) try to induce a general decision function for a learning task, Transductive Support Vector Machines take into account a particular test set and try to minimize misclassi cations of just those particular examples. The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes an algorithm for training TSVMs e ciently, handling 10,000 examples and more."

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."

A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data."

The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms."

The RBF rules of signs provide tight bounds for the number of zeros of univariate networks with certain parameter restrictions. Moreover, they can be used to infer that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and pseudodimension of these networks are no more than linear. This contrasts with previous work showing that RBF neural networks with two or more input nodes have superlinear VC dimension. The rules also give rise to lower bounds for network sizes, thus demonstrating the relevance of network parameters for the complexity of computing with RBF neural networks."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

The main result is that an AC/sup O/ Boolean function has almost all of its power spectrum on the low-order coefficients. This result implies the following properties of functions in AC/sup O/: functions in AC/sup O/ have low average sensitivity; they can be approximated well be a real polynomial of low degree; they cannot be pseudorandom function generators and their correlation with any polylog-wide independent probability distribution is small. An O(n/sup polylog(/ /sup sup)/ /sup (n)/)-time algorithm for learning functions in AC/sup O/ is obtained. The algorithm observed the behavior of an AC/sup O/ function on O(n/sup polylog/ /sup (n)/) randomly chosen inputs and derives a good approximation for the Fourier transform of the function. This allows it to predict with high probability the value of the function on other randomly chosen inputs.<<ETX>>"

Significant progress has been made recently in proving lower bounds in two restricted models of Boolean circuits. One is the model of small depth circuits, and in this book Johan Torkel Hastad has developed very powerful techniques for proving exponential lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits' computing functions.The techniques described in \"Computational Limitations for Small Depth Circuits\" can be used to demonstrate almost optimal lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits computing several different functions, such as parity and majority. The main tool used in the proof of the lower bounds is a lemma, stating that any AND of small fanout OR gates can be converted into an OR of small fanout AND gates with high probability when random values are substituted for the variables.Hastad also applies this tool to relativized complexity, and discusses in great detail the computation of parity and majority in small depth circuits.Contents: Introduction.

A number of important practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical perspective. These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case study in which TD(\u03bb) is applied to learning the game of backgammon from the outcome of self-play. This is apparently the first application of this algorithm to a complex non-trivial task. It is found that, with zero knowledge built in, the network is able to learn from scratch to play the entire game at a fairly strong intermediate level of performance, which is clearly better than conventional commercial programs, and which in fact surpasses comparable networks trained on a massive human expert data set. This indicates that TD learning may work better in practice than one would expect based on current theory, and it suggests that further analysis of TD methods, as well as applications in other complex domains, may be worth investigating."
