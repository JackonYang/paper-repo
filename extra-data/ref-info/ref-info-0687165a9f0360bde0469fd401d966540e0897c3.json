A class of Markov language models identified by Jelinek has achieved considerable success in this domain. A modification of the Markov approach, which assigns higher probabilities to recently used words, is proposed and tested against a pure Markov model. Parameter calculation and comparison of the two models both involve use of the LOB Corpus of tagged modern English."

The type of local dependencies considered are sequences of part of speech categories for words. The non-local context of word dependency considered here is that of word recurrence, which is typical in a text. Both are models of phenomena that are to a reasonable extent domain independent, and thus are useful for doing prediction in systems using large vocabularies."
