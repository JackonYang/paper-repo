In addition to certain anchor points that are available in our data, the only information about the sentences that we use for calculating alignments is the number of tokens that they contain. Because we make no use of the lexical details of the sentence, the alignment computation is fast and therefore practical for application to very large collections of text. We have used this technique to align several million sentences in the English-French Hansard corpora and have achieved an accuracy in excess of 99% in a random selected set of 1000 sentence pairs that we checked by hand. We show that even without the benefit of anchor points the correlation between the lengths of aligned sentences is strong enough that we should expect to achieve an accuracy of between 96% and 97%. Thus, the technique may be applicable to a wider variety of texts than we have yet tried."

This paper concentrates on the class of action verbs of movement, and builds on earlier work on lexical correspondences between languages and specific to this verb class. The languages we explore here are English and French. We first examine the way prototypical verbs of movement are translated in the Collins-Robert (Collins 1978, henceforth CR) bilingual dictionary. We then analyze the behavior of some of these verbs in a large bilingual corpus. We take advantage of the results of linguistic research on verb types (e.g. Levin, to appear) coupled with data from machine readable dictionaries to motivate corpus-based text analysis for the purpose of establishing lexical correspondences with the full range of associated translations and then attach frequencies to translations."

The method is based on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are translations of each other. In our case, the texts are in English and French.Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions. The steps of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutions. (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the corresponding set of fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence. (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence.We have developed statistical techniques facilitating both the automatic creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps, all on the basis of an alignment of corresponding sentences in the two texts.While we are not yet able to provide examples of French / English translation, we present some encouraging intermediate results concerning glossary creation and the arrangement of target word sequences."

The relaxation process rests on a notion of which word in one text corresponds to which word in the other text that is essentially based on the similarity of their distributions. It exploits a partial alignment of the word level to induce a maximum likelihood alignment of the sentence level, which is in turn used, in the next iteration, to refine the word level estimate. The algorithm appears to converge to the correct sentence alignment in only a few iterations."
