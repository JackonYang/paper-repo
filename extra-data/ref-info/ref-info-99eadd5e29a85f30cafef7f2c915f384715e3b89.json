The answer amounts to saying that for every branch of the tree of knowledge there is a corresponding root, and every advance in climbing seems to compel a similar advance in delving. Just as the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries led to the reconsideration of geometrical axioms, so Cantor's invention of transfinite numbers has reacted upon the theory of elementary arithmetic, and hence upon the whole of analysis and all its applications.Principia Mathematica.By Dr. A.

As becomes a logician, Mr. Sidgwick divides his hook into parts and smaller sections, with admirable system and sequence. Part i. deals with the syllogism in all its forms, also with induction and fallacies, in which matters the author follows Mill for the most part. Interesting illustrations are chosen, and the treatment renders the text as readable as circumstances allow. It is admittedly impossible to make \u201cBarbara\u201d and her associates look anything but dull, however they are dressed up; but logic (as Browning said of his own poetry) is \u201cnot a substitute for dominoes\u201d, so the student will no doubt struggle through. Mr. Sidgwick gets the dull part disposed of as quickly as thoroughness will allow. In Part ii. we reach the more interesting and \u201clive\u201d part. The modern point of view is adopted, and formal logic is shown to establish only validity and not truth, because there is always something assumed. Further, classes are man-made, not nature-made; and, as we cannot say all that can be said about S, S may be in one class in certain of its relations, and in another when others of its aspects are being considered. Briefly, truth is relative to purpose. And proof is never coercive. The new logical method is modest. It looks forward with confidence, however, to a \u201cgreat increase in the effectiveness of an appeal to facts against the verbalism which springs from uncritical acceptance of the abstract laws of thought\u201d.Elementary Logic.By A.

Herbrand's Theorem (see [8] or also [9], vol. 2) or Gentzen's Extended Hauptsatz (see [5] or also [10]) was first used along these lines by Beth [1]. Using a modified version he showed that for all first-order systems a certain modeltheoretic notion of definability coincides with a certain proof theoretic notion. In the present paper the Herbrand-Gentzen Theorem will be applied to generalize Beth's results from primitive predicate symbols to arbitrary formulas and terms. This may be interpreted as showing that (apart from some relatively minor exceptions which will be made apparent below) the expressive power of each first-order system is rounded out, or the system is functionally complete , in the following sense: Any functional relationship which obtains between concepts that are expressible in the system is itself expressible and provable in the system. A second application is concerned with the hierarchy of second-order formulas. A certain relationship is shown to hold between first-order formulas and those second-order formulas which are of the form (\u2203T 1 )\u2026(\u2203T k )A or (T 1 )\u2026(T k )A with A being a first-order formula. Modeltheoretically this can be regarded as a relationship between the class AC and the class PC \u22bf of sets of models, investigated by Tarski in [12] and [13]."

The purpose of the present note is to outline an extension of this result to the engere Funktionenkalkul of Hilbert and Ackermann. In the author's cited paper it is pointed out that there can be associated recursively with every well-formed formula a recursive enumeration of the formulas into which it is convertible. This means the existence of a recursively defined function a of two positive integers such that, if y is the Godel representation of a well-formed formula Y then a(x, y) is the Godel representation of the x th formula in the enumeration of the formulas into which Y is convertible. Consider the system L of symbolic logic which arises from the engere Funktionenkalkul by adding to it: as additional undefined symbols, a symbol 1 for the number 1 (regarded as an individual), a symbol = for the propositional function = (equality of individuals), a symbol s for the arithmetic function x +1, a symbol a for the arithmetic function a described in the preceding paragraph, and symbols b 1 , b 2 , \u2026, b k for the auxiliary arithmetic functions which are employed in the recursive definition of a ; and as additional axioms, the recursion equations for the functions a , b 1 , b 2 , \u2026, b k (expressed with free individual variables, the class of individuals being taken as identical with the class of positive integers), and two axioms of equality, x = x , and x = y \u2192[F(x)\u2192F(y)] ."
