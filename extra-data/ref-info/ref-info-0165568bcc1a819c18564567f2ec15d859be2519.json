Yet for most core natural language tasks, algorithms continue to be optimized, tested and compared after training on corpora consisting of only one million words or less. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different learning methods on a prototypical natural language disambiguation task, confusion set disambiguation, when trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data than has previously been used. We are fortunate that for this particular application, correctly labeled training data is free. Since this will often not be the case, we examine methods for effectively exploiting very large corpora when labeled data comes at a cost."

While this resource is widely used and proved itself useful for many purposes, it also is too coarse a grain-size for a lot of other purposes. In this paper we describe how we have used Amazon\u0092s Mechanical Turk to have multiple subjects read the documents and identify the sentences themselves which contain the answer. For most of the 1911 questions in the test sets from 2002 to 2006 and each of the documents said to contain an answer, the Question-Answer Sentence Pairs (QASP) corpus introduced in this paper contains the identified answer sentences. We believe that this corpus, which we will make available to the public, can further stimulate research in QA, especially linguistically motivated research, where matching the question to the answer sentence by either syntactic or semantic means is a central concern."

                "text": "This paper addresses the repeated acquisition of labels for data items when the labeling is imperfect. We examine the improvement (or lack thereof) in data quality via repeated labeling, and focus especially on the improvement of training labels for supervised induction. With the outsourcing of small tasks becoming easier, for example via Rent-A-Coder or Amazon's Mechanical Turk, it often is possible to obtain less-than-expert labeling at low cost. With low-cost labeling, preparing the unlabeled part of the data can become considerably more expensive than labeling. We present repeated-labeling strategies of increasing complexity, and show several main results. (i) Repeated-labeling can improve label quality and model quality, but not always. (ii) When labels are noisy, repeated labeling can be preferable to single labeling even in the traditional setting where labels are not particularly cheap. (iii) As soon as the cost of processing the unlabeled data is not free, even the simple strategy of labeling everything multiple times can give considerable advantage. (iv) Repeatedly labeling a carefully chosen set of points is generally preferable, and we present a robust technique that combines different notions of uncertainty to select data points for which quality should be improved. The bottom line: the results show clearly that when labeling is not perfect, selective acquisition of multiple labels is a strategy that data miners should have in their repertoire; for certain label-quality/cost regimes, the benefit is substantial."

Searching and browsing are the typical ways that users locate items of interest in such databases. Faceted interfaces represent a new powerful paradigm that proved to be a successful complement to keyword searching. Thus far, the identification of the facets was either a manual procedure, or relied on apriori knowledge of the facets that can potentially appear in the underlying collection. In this paper, we present an unsupervised technique for automatic extraction of facets useful for browsing text databases. In particular, we observe, through a pilot study, that facet terms rarely appear in text documents, showing that we need external resources to identify useful facet terms. For this, we first identify important phrases in each document. Then, we expand each phrase with \";context\"; phrases using external resources, such as WordNet and Wikipedia, causing facet terms to appear in the expanded database. Finally, we compare the term distributions in the original database and the expanded database to identify the terms that can be used to construct browsing facets. Our extensive user studies, using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service, show that our techniques produce facets with high precision and recall that are superior to existing approaches and help users locate interesting items faster."

                "text": "The TREC question answering track is an effort to bring the benefits of large-scale evaluation to bear on the question answering problem. The track contained two tasks in TREC 2002, the main task and the list task. Both tasks required that the answer strings returned by the systems consist of nothing more or less than an answer in contrast to the text snippets containing an answer allowed in previous years. A new evaluation measure in the main task, the confidence-weighted score, tested a system\u2019s ability to recognize when it has found a correct answer. The goal of the question answering (QA) track is to foster research on systems that retrieve answers rather than documents in response to a question, with particular emphasis on systems that can function in unrestricted domains. Now in its fourth year, the tasks in the track have evolved over the years to increase the realism of the task and to focus research on particular aspects of the problem deemed important to improving the state-of-the-art. All of the tasks have involved finding answers to closed-class questions within a large corpus of news text. This paper provides an overview of the TREC 2002 QA track. This year\u2019s track contained two tasks, the main task and the list task. Both tasks were also run in TREC 2001, but systems were required to return exact answers this year. That is, the text string returned by the system in response to a question was required to consist of a complete answer and nothing else, in contrast to earlier years where systems could return text strings that simply contained an answer. To make the paper self-contained, the first section recaps the tasks and evaluation procedures used in the first three tracks. The following sections then describe this year\u2019s tasks. 1 Evolution of the TREC QA Track The task in the first two QA tracks (TRECs 8 and 9) was the same. For each question in the question set, systems retrieved a ranked list of up to five text snippets that contained an answer to the question plus a document that supported the answer. The collection of documents from which the support was drawn was a large set of newswire and newspaper articles. The questions were restricted to factoid questions such as In what year did Joe DiMaggio compile his 56game hitting streak? and Name a film in which Jude Law acted. Each question was guaranteed to have at least one document in the collection that explicitly answered it. The maximum length of the text snippets was either 50 or 250 bytes, depending on the run type. Human assessors read each string and decided whether the string actually did contain an answer to the question in the context provided by the document. Given a set of judgments for the strings, the score computed for a submission was the mean reciprocal rank. An individual question received a score equal to the reciprocal of the rank at which the first correct response was returned, or zero if none of the five responses contained a correct answer. The score for a submission was then the mean of the individual questions\u2019 reciprocal ranks. The TREC-8 track both defined how answer strings were judged, and established that different assessors have different ideas as to what constitutes a correct answer even for the limited type of questions used in the track. A [document-id, answer-string] pair was judged correct if, in the opinion of the assessor, the answer-string contained an answer to the question, the answer-string was responsive to the question, and the document supported the answer. If the answer-string was responsive and contained a correct answer, but the document did not support that answer, the pair was judged \u201cNot supported\u201d. Otherwise, the pair was judged incorrect. Requiring that the answer string be responsive to the question addressed a variety of issues. Answer strings that contained multiple entities of the same semantic category as the correct answer but did not indicate which of those entities was the actual answer (e.g., a list of names in response to a who question) were judged as incorrect. Certain punctuation and units were also required. Thus \u201c5 5 billion\u2019\u2019 was not an acceptable substitute for \u201c5.5 billion\u201d, nor was \u201c500\u201d acceptable when the correct answer was \u201c$500\u201d. Finally, unless the question specifically stated otherwise, correct responses for questions about a famous entity had to refer to the famous entity and not to imitations, copies, etc. For example, two TREC-8 questions asked for the height of the Matterhorn (i.e., the Alp) and the replica of the Matterhorn at Disneyland. Correct responses for one of these questions were incorrect for the other. See [6] for a very detailed discussion of responsiveness. To test whether assessor opinions vary, each TREC-8 question was independently judged by three different assessors. The separate judgments were combined into a single judgment set through adjudication for the official track evaluation, but the individual judgments were used to measure the effect of differences in judgments on systems\u2019 scores. Assessors opinions did vary. For example, assessors differed on how much of a name was required and on the desired granularity of dates and locations. Fortunately, as with document retrieval evaluation, the relative mean reciprocal rank scores between QA systems remain stable despite differences in the judgments used to evaluate them [5]. The TREC 2001 track modified the main task to make it more realistic and introduced two new tasks, the list task and the context task. All runs were restricted to answer strings of maximum length 50 bytes since the results from the earlier tracks clearly demonstrated that allowing 250-byte answer strings was a much simpler problem. In the main task, the guarantee that a question had an answer in the document collection was eliminated. A system returned the string \u201cNIL\u201d to indicate its belief that there was no answer in the document collection. NIL was marked correct if there was no known answer for that question in the collection and incorrect otherwise. The list task required systems to assemble an answer from information located in multiple documents. Such questions are harder to answer than the questions used in the main task since information duplicated in the documents must be detected and reported only once. Each question in the list task specified a particular kind of information to be retrieved, such as Who are 6 actors who have played Tevye in \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d?. Systems returned an unordered list of [document-id, answer-string] pairs where each pair represented a single instance. Results were scored using mean accuracy, which is the ratio of the number of distinct correct responses retrieved to the target number of responses requested. The context task was a pilot evaluation for question answering within a particular scenario or context. The task was designed to represent the kind of dialog processing that a system would need to support an interactive user session. Questions were grouped into different series, and the QA system was expected to track the discourse objects across the individual questions of a series. Unfortunately, the results in the pilot were completely dominated by whether or not a system could answer the particular type of question: the ability to correctly answer questions later in a series was uncorrelated with the ability to correctly answer questions earlier in the series. Thus the task was not repeated in TREC 2002. 2 The TREC 2002 QA Track The TREC 2002 track repeated the main and list tasks from 2001, but with the major difference of requiring systems to return exact answers. The change to exact answers was motivated by the belief that a system\u2019s ability to recognize the precise extent of the answer is crucial to improving question answering technology. The problems with using text snippets containing the answer as responses were illustrated in the TREC 2001 track. For example, each of the answer strings shown in Figure 1 was judged correct for the question What river in the US is known as the Big Muddy?, yet earlier responses are clearly better than later ones. Judging only exact answers correct forces systems to demonstrate that they know precisely where the answer lies in such strings. What constitutes an \u201cexact answer\u201d? As with correctness, exactness is essentially a personal opinion. NIST provided guidelines to the assessors so that questions would be judged similarly, but in the end whether or not an answer was exact was up to the assessor. The guidelines given to the assessors are reproduced in Figure 2. Notice that even \u201cgood\u201d responses that contain a correct answer and justification for that answer were considered inexact for the purposes of this evaluation. A system response consisting of an [document-id, answer-string] pair was assigned exactly one judgment by a human assessor as follows: wrong: the answer string does not contain a correct answer or the answer is not responsive; not supported: the answer string contains a correct answer but the document returned does not support that answer; not exact: the answer string contains a correct answer and the document supports that answer, but the string contains more than just the answer (or is missing bits of the answer);"

We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus. We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty trace categories of the treebank."

Informally, a common-sense fact is a true statement about the world that is known to most humans: \"\"milk is white,\"\" \"\"touching hot metal hurts,\"\" etc. Several efforts have been devoted to collecting common-sense knowledge for the purpose of making computer programs more intelligent. Such efforts, however, have not succeeded in amassing enough data because the manual process of entering these facts is tedious. We therefore introduce Verbosity, a novel interactive system in the form of an enjoyable game. People play Verbosity because it is fun, and as a side effect of them playing, we collect accurate common-sense knowledge. Verbosity is an example of a game that not only brings people together for leisure, but also collects useful data for computer science."

The resulting database will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic frames underlying the meanings of the words described, and (b) the valence representation (semantic and syntactic) of several thousand words and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a representative collection of annotated corpus attestations, which jointly exemplify the observed linkings between \"frame elements\" and their syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical function, phrase type, and other syntactic traits).

Thus it can be viewed either as a corpus in which words have been tagged syntactically and semantically, or as a lexicon in which example sentences can be found for many definitions. A semantic concordance is being constructed to use in studies of sense resolution in context (semantic disambiguation). The Brown Corpus is the text and WordNet is the lexicon. Semantic tags (pointers to WordNet synsets) are inserted in the text manually using an interface, ConText, that was designed to facilitate the task. Another interface supports searches of the tagged text. Some practical uses for semantic concordances am proposed."

A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

However, the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size, time requirements, and monetary costs. Micro-task markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach."

Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem.

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be."

In a majority of the approaches, model\u2010based estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are derived from a latent class model in which the latent variable represents an individual's true unobserved disease status. For simplicity, initial approaches assumed that the diagnostic test results on the same subject were independent given the true disease status (i.e., the conditional independence assumption). More recently, various authors have proposed approaches for modeling the dependence structure between test results given true disease status. This note discusses a potential problem with these approaches. Namely, we show that when the conditional dependence between tests is misspecified, estimators of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence can be biased. Importantly, we demonstrate that with small numbers of tests, likelihood comparisons and other model diagnostics may not be able to distinguish between models with different dependence structures. We present asymptotic results that show the generality of the problem. Further, data analysis and simulations demonstrate the practical implications of model misspecification. Finally, we present some guidelines about the use of these models for practitioners."

One emerging approach to constructing such repositories is proactive knowledge collection from volunteer contributors. In this paper, we study the quality of the knowledge repository resulting from collecting spontaneous, little guided contributions of volunteers. In a representative collection of part-of information contributed by volunteers, we study the coverage and quality of the resulting collection. As a possible way to address the deficiencies, we outline a more managed, three-stage approach to the collection process, consisting of collection, evaluation & revision, and publication."
