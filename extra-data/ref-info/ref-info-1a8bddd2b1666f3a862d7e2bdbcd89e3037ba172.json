Here the input is a grey-scale or binary image and the desired output is a graphical pattern in continuous space, such as a list of geometric objects or a line drawing. The natural prior models are Markov point processes and random sets. We develop analogues of Besag\u2019s ICM algorithm and present relationships with existing techniques like the Hough transform and the erosion operator."

The set of all possible true images is assumed to be formed by a composition of that function with continuous mappings of the domain into itself. A prior Gaussian distribution is given on the set of continuous mappings. The observed image is assumed to be a degradation of the true image with additive noise. Given the observed image, a posterior distribution is then obtained and has the form of a nonlinear perturbation of the Gaussian measure on the space of mappings. We present simulations of the posterior distribution that lead to structural reconstructions of the true image in the sense that it enables us to determine landmarks and other characteristic features of the image, as well as to spot pathologies in it. Moreover, we show that the reconstruction algorithm is relatively robust when the images are degraded by noise that is not necessarily additive."

In almost all cases this has involved a description of the image at pixel level. In this paper we take the process further, and develop a spatial stochastic process of objects present in the image. The general theory is given and applied to images of spiral galaxies, with the aims of producing better schematic reconstructions and of automatically classifying galaxies."

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

Collectively these may be regarded asm configurations, or scalings, each ofn points inp-dimensions. The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling them configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion \u03a3i=1m \u03a3i=1n \u03942(Pj(i)Gi), whereGi is the centroid of them pointsPi(i) (i = 1, 2, ...,m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special casem = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed."

We examine Bayesian procedures to clean such images using explicit models from spatial statistics for the underlying structure, and compare these methods with those based on maximum entropy. This is an undated version of Molina and Ripley (1989) containing brief details of later work. Sections 1\u20135, 7 and 8 follow that paper and describe the deconvolution of galaxies. Further examples have been published in Molina et al. (1992a) for an astronomical audience. Work on the deconvolution of planetary images from Molina et al. (1992b, c) is reported in Section 6 with examples included in Section 7."

This paper describes a pilot study investigating familial shape in the sagittal plane (side view), using three data sets of normal Leeds schoolchildren. The study is exploratory in nature, because only small samples were available. Data acquisition was by means of the Quantec system, which obtains surface shape measurements and extracts a line representing the spinal curve. The coordinates of the spine line in the sagittal plane are then used to investigate familial correlations of spinal shape. The spine lines first undergo some preprocessing, including Procrustes rotations to remove location, rotation and size effects. Smoothed principal component analysis of the curves provides suitable shape variables, and familial correlations between curves are then investigated. The covariates of sex and height are also investigated in the analysis. It does appear that there could be some evidence for familial correlations in sagi..."

This is an extension of earlier work which considered marginal shape analysis. Special cases of the size and shape distribution are examined and the isotropic Gaussian model is investigated in particular detail. Various properties are studied, including conditional distributions and a curve of regression. Finally we consider some possible approaches to inference, including exact maximum likelihood estimation of size and shape. A practical biological application is given which investigates the size and shape of mouse vertebrae."

Statisticians are becoming interested in developing techniques to handle the highly structured data of images. Statistical work in this area is surveyed, and two problems discussed in more detail. The first is a form of image segmentation, classifying the pixels of a satellite picture by land use. The second is the summarization of electron micrographs. \n \n \n \nOn accumule de plus en plus de donnees sous forme d'images, surtout dans les domaines ou interviennent la microscopie ou la teledetection. II n'est done pas surprenant que les statisticiens s'interessent au developpement de techniques permettant d'analyser les donnees hyper-structurees que nous procurent ces images. Nous voulons brosser ici un tableau des progres accomplis dans ce domaine en nous attardant plus particulierement a deux de leurs applications. La premiere concerne la classification de parcelles de terre en fonction de l'utilisation des sols a partir d'une composition photographique realisee par satellite. La seconde application a trait a la micrographie des electrons."

The shape density is written in a closed form, in terms of Kendall's or Bookstein's shape variables. The distribution simplifies considerably in certain cases, including the complex normal, isotropic, circular Markov and equal means cases. Various asymptotic properties of the distribution are investigated, including a large variation distribution and the normal approximation for small variations. The triangle case is considered in particular detail, and we compare the density with simulated densities for some examples. Finally, we consider inference problems, with an application in biology."

In learning a regular grammar, they use recent results on the stochastic representation of strongly connected regular grammars in order to derive an algorithm based on mutual information for learning the minimal state set as well as the production rules of the grammar. These learning results are then extended to multiple dimensions by extending the state structure of the regular grammar to the neighborhood structure of multidimensional random fields. This allows the authors to learn textures for image segmentation and reconstruction. The implementation of the learning algorithms on connection architectures is described.<<ETX>>"

Motivation and examples are taken from statistical mechanics and field theory. Detailed procedures are developed for the fast global minimization of discretestate functionals, or other functionals with many local minima, using new principles of multilevel interactions. Tests with Ising spin models are reported.

The easiest case is when the configurations form the subsets of some finite lattice (thus the state space is finite). In this case we look at the relationships between time-reversibility, nearest neighbour interactions, and the equilibrium state being a Markov random field. A more interesting case is when the entities which can be born or die can do so at any point in some bounded region of space (or the plane). This gives us a pure jump process, whose general properties are well-known, (see for example, Feller (1966) Vol. II Chapter X.3).

The output of each sensor in the array is the sum of signals received from each of the targets. The results of direction-of-arrival estimation by eigenvalue analysis are extended to derive a recursive procedure based on a matrix quadratic equation. The solution of this matrix quadratic equation is used to provide updated target positions. A linear approximation method for estimating the solution of the matrix equation is presented. The algorithm is demonstrated by the simulated tracking of two targets. The main advantage of the algorithm is that a closed-form solution for updating the target angle estimates has been obtained. Also, its application is straightforward, and the data association problem due to uncertainty in the origin of the measurements is avoided. However, it requires the inversion of an N*N as well as other linear operations, so that the computational burden becomes substantial as N becomes very large. >"

The ML method distinguishes signal from noise in the NMR spectrum by providing direct estimates of the NMR signal parameters. It is shown that the ML estimates of the frequencies and phase parameters of the FID models are unbiased, with the amplitudes and exponential decay parameters showing increasing bias with noise power. Methods to speed up the computation of the ML algorithm on parallel computers are developed, demonstrating that the class of single-instruction multiple-data-stream machines allows for parallelism on the order of the number of data points in the FID. The class of multiple-instruction multiple-data-stream machines affords parallelism at the level of the number of sinusoids in the FID."

Using a real, moderately complex, medical example we illustrate how qualitative and quantitative knowledge can be represented within a directed graphical model, generally known as a belief network in this context. Exact probabilistic inference on individual cases is possible using a general propagation procedure. When data on a series of cases are available, Bayesian statistical techniques can be used for updating the original subjective quantitative inputs, and we present a sets of diagnostics for identifying conflicts between the data and the prior specification. A model comparison procedure is explored, and a number of links made with mainstream statistical methods. Details are given on the use of Dirichlet prior distributions for learning about parameters and the process of transforming the original graphical model to a junction tree as the basis for efficient computation."

                "text": "A new method for analysis of electron microscope autoradiographs is described which is based on the maximum-likelihood method of statistics for estimating the intensities of radioactivity in organelle structures. We adopted a Poisson statistical model to describe the autoradiographic grain distributions that we prove results from the underlying Poisson nature of the radioactive decays as well as the additive errors introduced during the formation of grains. Within the model, an interative procedure derived from the expectation-maximization algorithm of mathematical statistics is used to generate the maximum-likelihood estimates. The algorithm has the properties that at every stage of the iteration process the likelihood of the data increases; and for all initial nonzero starting points the algorithm converges to the maximum-likelihood estimates of the organelle intensities. \n \nThe maximum-likelihood approach differs from the mask-analysis method, and other published quantitative algorithms in the following ways: (1) In deriving estimates of the radioactivity intensities the maximum-likelihood algorithm requires that we obtain the actual locations of the grains as well as the micrograph geometries; each micrograph is digitized so that both the grain locations as well as the geometries of the organelle structures can be used. (2) The maximum-likelihood algorithm iteratively computes the minimum-meansquared-error estimate of the underlying emission locations that resulted in the observed grain distributions, from which intensity estimates are generated; this algorithm does not minimize a chi-squared error statistic. (3) The maximum-likelihood approach is based on a Poisson model and is therefore valid for low-count experiments; there are no minimum constraints on data collection for any single organelle compartment. (4) The maximum-likelihood algorithm requires the form of the point-spread function describing the emission spread; a probability matrix based on the use of overlay masks is not required. (5) The maximum-likelihood algorithm does not change for different organelle geometries; arbitrary geometries are incorporated by maximizing the likelihood-function subject to the geometry constraints. \n \nWe have performed a preliminary evaluation of the quantitative accuracy of the maximum-likelihood and mask-analysis algorithms. Based on two different phantoms in which we compared the squared error resulting from the two algorithms, we find that the new maximum-likelihood approach provides substantially improved estimates of the radioactivity intensities of the phantoms."

The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

Three-dimensional (3-D) analyses have largely consisted of qualitative descriptions rather than a quantitative treatment of these changes. Until recently, the lack of availability of 3-D data for the face and head has limited the advancement of these techniques. However, with 3-D information readily available from a laser scanning system which we have constructed, a technique has been applied which describes mathematically the facial shape and changes occurring in the face in terms of fundamental surface types. The method is described and used to compare the faces of two patients (one a cleft palate patient and the other a long-face, Class II malocclusion patient) before and after surgery along with the clinical description of the surgery, the resulting facial changes, the actual surgery performed, and the predicted surgical expectation. A strong relationship is found between the surface type description and the clinical observations. The implications of the method for surgery, facial aesthetics, and other disciplines are discussed."

The authors' approach establishes the formal connection of rules to Chomsky grammars and generalizes the original work of Shannon on the encoding of rule-based channel sequences to Markov chains of maximum entropy. This maximum entropy probabilistic view leads to Gibbs representations with potentials which have their number of minima growing at precisely the exponential rate that the language of deterministically constrained sequences grow. These representations are coupled to stochastic diffusion algorithms, which sample the language-constrained sequences by visiting the energy minima according to the underlying Gibbs probability law. This coupling yields the result that fully parallel stochastic cellular automata can be derived to generate samples from the rule-based constraint sets. The production rules and neighborhood state structure of the language of sequences directly determine the necessary connection structures of the required parallel computing surface. Representations of this type have been mapped to the DAP-510 massively parallel processor consisting of 1024 mesh-connected bit-serial processing elements for performing automated segmentation of electron-micrograph images."

Both deterministic and stochastic signal models are considered. The algorithm for the deterministic model yields estimates of the signal amplitudes, while that for the stochastic model yields estimates of the powers of the signal. Both algorithms have the properties that their limit points are stable and satisfy the necessary maximizer conditions for maximum-likelihood estimators. It is shown via simulation that the maximum-likelihood method allows for the resolution of the directions-of-arrival of signals at angular separation and noise levels for which other high-resolution methods will not work. Algorithm convergence does depend on initial conditions; however, convergence to a global maximum has been observed in simulation when the initial estimates are within a significant fraction if one beamwidth (componentwise) of this maximum. Simulations also show that the deterministic model has a significant impact on the angle estimator performance. >"

The targets are assumed to be moving with constant accelerations subject to minor random perturbations and emitting narrow band signals that impinge on an array of passive sensors. Estimates of the DOA vector of the targets are obtained from the sensor data based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle in such a way that the association between the estimates made at different time points is maintained. At each stage, the current ML estimates of DOA are treated as measurements and refined via a Kalman filter; tracking is accomplished without the need to perform unduly heavy computations. An efficient strategy for dealing with closely spaced targets is also presented. Finally, the performance of the tracking algorithm is illustrated via computer simulations. >"

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas.

These systems gave an exponentially damped response to step or impulse inputs. In Chapter 8, we showed how a second-order system can give rise to a sinusoidal response. In this chapter, we will discuss a simple circuit that can generate a sinusoidal response. We call this circuit the second-order section; we can use it to generate any response that can be represented by two poles in the complex plane, where the two poles have both real and imaginary parts. With this circuit, we can adjust the positions of the complex-conjugate poles anywhere in the plane. The second-order circuit is shown in Figure 11.1; it contains two cascaded follower\u2013integrator circuits and an extra amplifier. The capacitance C is the same for both stages (C1 = C2 = C), and the transconductance of the two feed-forward amplifiers, A1 and A2, are the same: G1 = G2 = G (approximately\u2014if G is defined as the average of G1 and G2, small differences will have no first-order effect on the parameters of the response). We obtain an oscillatory response by adding the feedback amplifier A3. This amplifier has transconductance G3, and its output current is proportional to the difference between V2 and V3, but the sign of the feedback is positive; for small signals, I3 is equal to G3(V2 \u2212 V3). If we reduce the feedback to zero by shutting off the bias current in A3, each follower\u2013integrator circuit will have the transfer function given"

                "text": "SUMMARY A generalization of the sampling method introduced by Metropolis et al. (1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed. For numerical problems in a large number of dimensions, Monte Carlo methods are often more efficient than conventional numerical methods. However, implementation of the Monte Carlo methods requires sampling from high dimensional probability distributions and this may be very difficult and expensive in analysis and computer time. General methods for sampling from, or estimating expectations with respect to, such distributions are as follows. (i) If possible, factorize the distribution into the product of one-dimensional conditional distributions from which samples may be obtained. (ii) Use importance sampling, which may also be used for variance reduction. That is, in order to evaluate the integral J = X) p(x)dx = Ev(f), where p(x) is a probability density function, instead of obtaining independent samples XI, ..., Xv from p(x) and using the estimate J, = Zf(xi)/N, we instead obtain the sample from a distribution with density q(x) and use the estimate J2 = Y{f(xj)p(x1)}/{q(xj)N}. This may be advantageous if it is easier to sample from q(x) thanp(x), but it is a difficult method to use in a large number of dimensions, since the values of the weights w(xi) = p(x1)/q(xj) for reasonable values of N may all be extremely small, or a few may be extremely large. In estimating the probability of an event A, however, these difficulties may not be as serious since the only values of w(x) which are important are those for which x -A. Since the methods proposed by Trotter & Tukey (1956) for the estimation of conditional expectations require the use of importance sampling, the same difficulties may be encountered in their use. (iii) Use a simulation technique; that is, if it is difficult to sample directly from p(x) or if p(x) is unknown, sample from some distribution q(y) and obtain the sample x values as some function of the corresponding y values. If we want samples from the conditional dis"

Here, we analyze the dynamics of continuous state Markov chains which arise from a particular implementation of the Metropolis and heat-bath Markov chain sampling methods. It is shown that certain continuous-time interpolations of the Metropolis and heat-bath chains converge weakly to Langevin diffusions running at different time scales. This exposes a close and potentially useful relationship between the Markov chain and diffusion versions of simulated annealing."

This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space I* ca n be identified with a version of CP*~ 2 . Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CP k ~ 2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established."

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of \"phrase structure\" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Silverman in the Chair] SUMMARY Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have provided a Bayesian inference machine in image analysis and in other areas of spatial statistics for several years, founded on the pioneering ideas of Ulf Grenander. More recently, the observation that hyperparameters can be included as part of the updating schedule and the fact that almost any multivariate distribution is equivalently a Markov random field has opened the way to the use of MCMC in general Bayesian computation. In this paper, we trace the early development of MCMC in Bayesian inference, review some recent computational progress in statistical physics, based on the introduction of auxiliary variables, and discuss its current and future relevance in Bayesian applications. We briefly describe a simple MCMC implementation for the Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments, with which we have some practical experience."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

The model incorporates a physically-based approximation to facial tissue and a set of anatomically-motivated facial muscle actuators. Despite its sophistication, the model is efficient enough to produce facial animation at interactive rates on a high-end graphics workstation. A second contribution of this paper is a technique for estimating muscle contractions from video sequences of human faces performing expressive articulations. These estimates may be input as dynamic control parameters to the face model in order to produce realistic animation. Using an example, we demonstrate that our technique yields sufficiently accurate muscle contraction estimates for the model to reproduce expressions from dynamic images of faces."

                "text": "In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment."

The authors apply flexible constraints, in the form of a probabilistic deformable model, to the problem of segmenting natural 2-D objects whose diversity and irregularity of shape make them poorly represented in terms of fixed features or form. The parametric model is based on the elliptic Fourier decomposition of the boundary. Probability distributions on the parameters of the representation bias the model to a particular overall shape while allowing for deformations. Boundary finding is formulated as an optimization problem using a maximum a posteriori objective function. Results of the method applied to real and synthetic images are presented, including an evaluation of the dependence of the method on prior information and image quality. >"

The ideal textbook is constructed on a fixed coordinate system to contain all of the information currently available about the physical properties of neuroanatomies. This information is obtained via sensor probes such as magnetic resonance, as well as computed axial and emission tomography, along with symbolic information such as white- and gray-matter tracts, nuclei, etc. Human variability associated with individuals is accommodated by defining probabilistic transformations on the textbook coordinate system, the transformations forming mathematical translation groups of high dimension. The ideal is applied to the individual patient by finding the transformation which is consistent with physical properties of deformable elastic solids and which brings the coordinate system of the textbook to that of the patient. Registration, segmentation, and fusion all result automatically because the textbook carries symbolic values as well as multisensor features."

Context-free grammars are used to categorize the ways in which nodes branch to yield daughter nodes, thus providing an organized setting to examine the entropies for random branching processes whose realizations are trees and whose probabilities are determined by probabilities associated with the substitution rules of the grammar. Normalized entropy rates H are derived for the critical branching rate and supercritical branching rate processes. An equipartition theorem is proved for the supercritical processes. A strong departure from classical theorems for Markov sources occurs for supercritical branching processes as the typical sets have supergeometric growth rates. The combinatorics of the set of all trees that can be generated from the context-free substitution rules is also studied. >"
