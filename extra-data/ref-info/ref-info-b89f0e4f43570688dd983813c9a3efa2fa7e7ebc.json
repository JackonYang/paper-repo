The algorithm operates by estimating the eigen light-field of the subject's head from the input gallery or probe images. Matching between the probe and gallery is then performed using the eigen light-fields.

For face identification, we use the shape and texture parameters of the model that are separated from imaging parameters, such as pose and illumination. In addition to the identity, the system provides a measure of confidence. We report experimental results for more than 4000 images from the publicly available CMU-PIE database."

This paper presents appearance-based methods which, unlike previous appearance-based approaches, require only a small set of training images to generate a rich representation that models this variability. Specifically, from as few as three images of an object in fixed pose seen under slightly varying but unknown lighting, a surface and an albedo map are reconstructed. These are then used to generate synthetic images with large variations in pose and illumination and thus build a representation useful for object recognition. Our methods have been tested within the domain of face recognition on a subset of the Yale Face Database B containing 4050 images of 10 faces seen under variable pose and illumination. This database was specifically gathered for testing these generative methods. Their performance is shown to exceed that of popular existing methods."

We then present the CMU-Pittsburgh AU-Coded Face Expression Image Database, which currently includes 2105 digitized image sequences from 182 adult subjects of varying ethnicity, performing multiple tokens of most primary FACS action units. This database is the most comprehensive testbed to date for comparative studies of facial expression analysis."

To demonstrate this, we develop a statistical shape-fromshading model to recover face shape from a single image, and to synthesize the same face under new illumination. We then use this to build a simple and fast classifier that was not possible before because of a lack of training data."

The system consists of a two-level hierarchy of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. On the first level, component classifiers independently detect components Of a face. On the second level, a single classifier checks if the geometrical configuration of the detected components in the image matches a geometrical model of a face. We propose a method for automatically learning components by using 3-D head models, This approach has the advantage that no manual interaction is required for choosing and extracting components. Experiments show that the component-based system is significantly more robust against rotations in depth than a comparable system trained on whole face patterns."

Component-based face classifiers are then combined in a second stage to yield a hierarchical SVM classifier. Experimental results in face classification show considerable robustness against rotations in depth and suggest performance at significantly better level than other face detection systems. Novel aspects of our approach are: a) an algorithm to learn component-based classification experts and their combination, b) the use of 3-D morphable models for training, and c) a maximum operation on the output of each component classifier which may be relevant for biological models of visual recognition."
