The only dataset used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

Emphasis is put on exploring the uniqueness of the problem and comparing the assumptions, implementations, and merits of various solutions in the literature. An attempt is made to compile a list of critical issues to consider when designing a relevance feedback algorithm. With a comprehensive review as the main portion, this paper also offers some novel solutions and perspectives throughout the discussion."

The camera metadata, typically stored in an EXIF header, contains a rich set of information reflecting the conditions under which the photograph was captured. This set of rich information can be potentially useful for improvement in digital photography but its multi-dimensionality and heterogeneous data structure make it difficult to be useful. Knowledge discovery, on the other hand, is usually associated with data mining to extract potentially useful information from complex data sets. In this paper we use a knowledge discovery framework based on data mining to automatically associate combinations of high-dimensional, heterogeneous metadata with scene types. In this way, we can perform very simple and efficient scene classification for certain types of photographs. We have also provided an interactive user interface in which a user can type in a query on metadata and the system will retrieve from our image database the images that satisfy the query and display them. We have used this approach to associate EXIF metadata with specific scene types like back-lit scenes, night scenes and snow scenes. To improve the classification results, we have combined an initial classification based only on the metadata with a simple, histogram based analysis for quick verification of the discovered knowledge. The classification results, in turn, can be used to better manage, assess, or enhance the photographs."

Specifically, we identify the challenging issues that are particular to the evaluation of retrieval employing relevance feedback.\n Next, we propose three guidelines to move toward more effective evaluation benchmarks. We focus particularly on assessing feedback methods more directly in terms of their goal of identifying the relevant target class with a small number of samples, and show how to compensate for query targets of varying difficulty by measuring efficiency at generalization."

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

While different systems clearly have their particular strengths, they tend to use different collections to highlight the advantages of their algorithms. Consequently, a degree of bias may exist, and it also makes it difficult to make comparisons concerning the relative superiority of different algorithms. In order for the field of visual information search to make further progress, a need therefore exists for a standardised benchmark suite to be developed. By having a uniform measure of search performance, research progress can be more easily recognised and charted, and the resultant synergy will be essential to further development of the field. This paper presents concrete proposals concerning the development of such a benchmark, and by adopting an extensible framework, it is able to cater for a wide variety of applications paradigms and to lend itself to incremental refinement."
