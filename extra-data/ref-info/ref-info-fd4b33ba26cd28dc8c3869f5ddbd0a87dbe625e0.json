It has repeatedly been observed, however, that geniculocortical terminations in the monkey constitute only about 30% of the total number of synapses even in layer 4 (Peters, 1987, in Volume 6 of this series).

Such oscillatory activity is not unique to man but has been seen in many mammalian forms during attentive states (Bouyer et al, 1987) and during physiological stimulation of the olfactory (Bressler and Freeman, 1980) or the visual systems (Eckhorn et al., 1988; Gray and Singer, 1989). However, these 40-Hz activity recording were restricted to localized brain areas and on occasion to small cell groups, to include a few cortical columns. Even in those studies where EEG and MEG recordings were attained, data analysis was restricted to a single time slice at the maximum positive or negative peak of an averaged evoked response. Nevertheless, these studies indicate that 40-Hz coherent neuronal activity large enough to be detected from the scalp is generated during cognitive tasks (cf. Sheer, 1989)."

Having more visual areas probably increases visual abilities, perhaps in part by allowing more stimulus parameters to be considered. Proposals that each visual area computes and thereby detects a specific stimulus attribute have so far dealt with attributes that most mammals can detect and thus do not relate to the issue of species differences in numbers of areas. The problem of forming and maintaining complex patterns of interconnections between many different sets of distinct processing models within an area may limit multiplying functions within a field. In addition, the adding of new visual areas is a way of avoiding constraints on modifying existing visual areas that are imposed by the ongoing functional requirements. Thus, increasing the number of visual or other cortical areas is an effective and apparently common mechanism for evolving new capacities."

MFT has a temporal resolution better than 1 msec and a spatial accuracy of 2-5 mm at the cortical level, which deteriorates to 1-3 cm at depths of 6 cm or more. MFT is used here to visualize the origin of a spatiotemporally organized pattern of coherent 40-Hz electrical activity. This coherence, initially observed during auditory input, was proposed to be generated by recurrent corticothalamic oscillation. In support of this hypothesis, we illustrate well-defined 40-Hz coherence between cortical-subcortical sites with a time shift that is consistent with thalamocortical conduction times. Studies on Alzheimer patients indicate that, while a similar activity pattern is present, the cortical component is reduced in these subjects."

The oscillatory field potential and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity generated by the model was compared with actual physiological results. The model was able to produce patterns of activity similar to those recorded physiologically in response to both weak and strong electrical shocks to the afferent input. The model also generated activity patterns similar to EEGs recorded in behaving animals. 3. In addition to replicating known physiological responses, it has been possible to use the simulations to explore the interactions of network components that might underlie these responses. This analysis suggests that the physiological properties of the cortex are dependent on the complex interaction of both network and cellular properties. In particular, we have found that the relationship between conduction velocities in intrinsic cortical fiber systems and the time constants of excitatory and inhibitory effects are critical for replicating physiological results. 4. Analysis of the model also suggests a correspondence between the 40-Hz oscillatory patterns of activity induced by low levels of odor-like stimulation and oscillatory patterns seen in lightly anesthetized cortex in response to weak electrical shocks to the afferent fiber system. 5. The specific relationships we have found between the different components of the model also support several speculations on their functional significance. The simulations suggest that during each 40-Hz cycle of EEG activity there is a convergence in rostral cortex of afferent information from the olfactory bulb and recurrent association fiber information from caudal cortex. This convergence could underlie an iterative process central to the recognition of complex olfactory stimuli."

On the basis of 28 complete axon reconstructions, several characteristic features have been identified. (1) Individual axons arborize in multiple layers: 1, 2, 5, and (inconstantly) 3. A single axon may have numerous terminal clusters in layers 1 and 2, but at most one in layer 3. (2) Axons typically ascend to layer 1, turn asymmetrically in one direction, and travel for long distances in this layer (1.10\u20134.30 mm; dimensions uncorrected for shrinkage). A few axons (three of 28 reconstructed) were found to have a single terminal cluster (0.3\u20130.5 mm wide) in layers 1 and 2. (3) Collaterals in layer 5 seem to extend over shorter distances (0.60 mm or less). (4) Delicate sprays of boutons (both beads and spines) are clustered along the main trunk. Spacing is variable but usually ranges from 0.35 mm to 0.65 mm. (5) In addition to clustered boutons, there can be linear collaterals, continuously studded with boutons, parallel to the main axon in layer 1."

The local axon collaterals of corticothalamic (CT) projection cells in the posteromedial barrel subfield area of primary somatosensory cortex were labeled by the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into the ipsilateral thalamus. Thalamocortical (TC) axon terminals in the same region of cortex were labeled by lesion induced degeneration. CT axon terminals synapsed preferentially with dendritic shafts, whereas TC axon terminals synapsed mainly with dendritic spines. Some dendrites received both CT and TC synapses. Dendrites postsynaptic to CT axon terminals were reconstructed from serial thin sections; on the basis of their shapes and synaptic connections, these dendrites were interpreted to belong to nonspiny multipolar cells. These results indicate that a reciprocal synaptic relationship exists in the cortex between nonspiny multipolar cells and CT projection cells. Both CT projection cells and nonspiny multipolar neurons have been shown previously to receive TC synapses (White and Hersh: J. Neurocytol. 11:137\u2013157, '82; White, Benshalom, and Hersch: J. Comp. Neurol 229:311\u2013320, '84). These findings imply that a0 triadic relationship involving afferent input and populations of CT projection and intrinsic neurons is a basic feature of the synaptic organization of the cerebral cortex."

This model is built up within a computer by 'recoding' a body of information from an ordinary dictionary into a complex network of elements and associations. Then the ability of a program to use the resulting model memory effectively for simulating human performance provides a test of its design. One simulation program, now running, is given the model memory and is required to compare and contrast the meanings of arbitrary pairs of English words. For each pair, the program locates any relevant semantic information within the model memory, draws inferences on the basis of this, and thereby discovers various relationships between the meanings of the two words. Finally, it creates English text to express its conclusions. The design principles embodied in the memory model together with some of the methods used by the program constitute a theory of how human memory for semantic and other conceptual material may be formatted, organized, and used.

In considering how these properties are generated, we have focused on the intrinsic cortical circuitry, and particularly on the projection to layer 4 from layer 6. Layer 6 pyramidal cells were injected with horseradish peroxidase and examined at the light and electron microscopic level. The labeled axon terminals were found to form asymmetric synapses and to show a strong preference for contacting dendritic shafts. Serial reconstruction of dendrites postsynaptic to labeled layer 6 cell axon terminals showed that a large proportion of the postsynaptic dendrites belonged to smooth and sparsely spiny stellate cells, suggesting a selective innervation of these cell types. In contrast, the geniculate projection to layer 4 made synapses primarily with dendritic spines and, as a result, the large majority of terminals ended on spiny cells. Since smooth and sparsely spiny stellate cells are thought to mediate inhibition within the cortex, we suggest that one effect of the layer 6 to layer 4 projection could be to contribute to inhibitory features of the receptive fields of layer 4 cells."

This strategy can be used for resolving computational problems arising in the domains of stereopsis, directed visual attention, and the perception of moving images. In each of these situations, some means of dynamically controlling how retinal outputs map onto higher-level targets is desirable--in order to achieve binocular fusion, to allow shifts of the focus of attention, and to prevent blurring of moving images. The proposed solution involves what we term \"shifter circuits,\" which allow for dynamic shifts in the relative alignment of input and output arrays without loss of local spatial relationships. The shifts are produced in increments along a succession of relay stages that are linked by diverging excitatory inputs. The direction of shift is controlled at each stage by inhibitory neurons that selectively suppress appropriate sets of ascending inputs. The shifter hypothesis is consistent with available anatomical and physiological evidence on the organization of the primate visual pathway, and it offers a sensible explanation for a variety of otherwise puzzling facts, such as the plethora of cells in the geniculorecipient layers of V1."

When I first began to study computer vision about ten years ago, I read parts of this book but did not really understand his insight. However, as I worked in the field, every time I felt I saw what was going on in a broader perspective or saw some theme which seemed to pull together the field as a whole, it turned out that this theme was part of what Grenander called pattern theory. It seems to me now that this is the right framework for these areas, and, as these fields have been growing explosively, the time is ripe for making an attempt to reexamine recent progress and try to make the ideas behind this unification better known. This article presents pattern theory from my point of view, which may be somewhat narrower than Grenander\u2019s, updated with recent examples involving interesting new mathematics."

The receptive field, or retinal response area, of an individual visual neuron moves with the eyes so that after an eye movement it covers a new portion of visual space. For some parietal neurons, the location of the receptive field is shown to shift transiently before an eye movement. In addition, nearly all parietal neurons respond when an eye movement brings the site of a previously flashed stimulus into the receptive field. Parietal cortex both anticipates the retinal consequences of eye movements and updates the retinal coordinates of remembered stimuli to generate a continuously accurate representation of visual space."

The proposed Coupled-Membrane model applies the weak membrane approach to an image WI(\u03c3,\u03b8, x, y), derived from the power responses of a family of selfsimilar quadrature Gabor wavelets. While segmentation breaks are allowed in x and y only, coupling is introduced to in all 4 dimensions. The resulting spatial and spectral diffusion prevents minor variations in local textures from producing segmentation boundaries. Experiments showed that the model is adequate in segmenting a class of synthetic and natural texture images."
