We give a new linear-time algorithm to calculate the fill-in produced by any elimination ordering, and we give two new related algorithms for finding orderings with special properties. One algorithm, based on breadth-first search, finds a perfect elimination ordering, if any exists, in $O(n + e)$ time, if the problem graph has n vertices and e edges. An extension of this algorithm finds a minimal (but not necessarily minimum) ordering in $O(ne)$ time. We conjecture that the problem of finding a minimum ordering is NP-complete"

                "text": "Abstract : According to present genetic theory, the fine structure of genes consists of linearly ordered elements. A mutant gene is obtained by alteration of some connected portion of this structure. By examining data obtained from suitable experiments, it can be determined whether or not the blemished portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and thus intersection data for a large number of mutants can be represented as an undirected graph. If this graph is an interval graph, then the observed data is consistent with a linear model of the gene. The problem of determining when a graph is an interval graph is a special case of the following problem concerning (0, 1)-matrices: When can the rows of such a matrix be permuted so as to make the 1's in each colum appear consecutively. A complete theory is obtained for this latter problem, culminating in a decomposition theorem which leads to a rapid algorithm for deciding the question, and for constructing the desired permutation when one exists."

A triangulation T is minimal (minimum) if there exists no triangulation $\\hat T$ such that $\\hat{T} \\subset \\subset T(|\\hat{T}| < |T|)$, where $ \\subset \\subset $ denotes the strict inclusion, and an ordering $\\alpha $ is optimal (optimum) if a minimal (minimum) triangulation is generated by a.

This step-by-step method facilitates both the testing of H and the calculation of , the estimated expected frequencies in the m-way table under H. The method introduced herein for calculating is easier to apply than the usual iterative-scaling method in many cases."

Any such hypergraph may be associated with a graph, its 2-section, and we will discuss the relation between the decomposability of C and properties of this graph. We find, for example, that the family of all decomposable classes C may be identified with the family of graphs called triangulated by Berge (1973), page 368, rigid circuit (Dirac, 1961) or chordal graphs (Gavril, 1972), a class of graphs apparently first investigated by Hajnal and Suranyi (1958)."

A hierarchical log-linear model for such a contingency table is uniquely specified by the (generating) class S of pairwise incomparable subsets of C, whose marginals {nc: c \u00a3 6} constitute the minimal sufficient statistics for the model; see Haberman (1974) for background and further details. A problem considered by Haberman (1974) is the following: for which classes Q does there exist an explicit formula for the maximum likelihood estimator m, of m = E{\u00ab}, under the model defined by 6? For example, an explicit formula exists for S3 = {{1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}}, but not for 6 4 = {{1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,1}}."
