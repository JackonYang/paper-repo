In a distributed neural network architecture each symbol is represented by activity in many units and each unit contributes to the representation of many symbols. Manipulating symbols using this type of distributed representation is not as easy as with a local representation whore each unit denotes one symbol, but there is evidence that the distributed approach is the one chosen by nature. We describe a working implementation of a production system interpreter in a neural network using distributed representations for both symbols and rules. The research provides a detailed account of two important symbolic reasoning operations, pattern matching and variable binding, as emergent properties of collections of neuron-like elements. The success of our production system implementation goes some way towards answering a common criticism of connectionist theories: that they aren't powerful enough to do symbolic reasoning."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

In my estimate, the most fundamental contribution so far of artificial intelligence and computer science to the joint enterprise of cognitive science has been the notion of a physical symbol system, i.e., the concept of a broad class of systems capable of having and manipulating symbols, yet realizable in the physical universe. The notion of symbol so defined is internal to this concept, so it becomes a hypothesis that this notion of symbols includes the symbols that we humans use every day of our lives. In this paper we attempt systematically, but plainly, to lay out the nature of physical symbol systems. Such a review is in ways familiar, but not thereby useless. Restatement of fundamentals is an important exercise.The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or the U.S. Government.Herb Simon would be a co-author of this paper, except that he is giving his own paper at this conference. The key ideas are entirely joint, as the references indicate."

I describe a framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined non-linearly. This non-linearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances have little or no effect under other conditions. Two attempts to rule out an interactive account in favor of models in which individual components of the language processing system act autonomously are considered in light of the interactive activation framework. In both cases, the facts are as expected from the principles of interactive activation. In general, existing facts do not rule out an interactive account, but they do not require one either. To demonstrate that more definitive tests of interaction are possible. I describe an experiment that demonstrates a new kind of influence of a higher level factor (lexical membership) a lower level of processing (phoneme identification). The experiment illustrates one reason why feedback from higher levels is computationally desirable; it allows lower levels to be tuned by contextual factors so that they can supply more accurate information to higher levels."

We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply the model to \"categorical perception.\" Finally, we discuss probability learning. The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy."

Consideration is given to linear algebra in PDP, the logic of additive functions, resource requirements of standard and programmable nets, and the P3 parallel-network simulating system."

Very rarely, a book is published which not only advances our knowledge of a particular topic, but fundamentally recasts our methods of investigating and thinking about large tracts of the map of learning. Linguists remember 1957 as the publication year of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic structures-a book whose ostensible subjects were the structure of English grammatical rules and the goals of grammatical description, but which can be seen with hindsight as the first shot in an intellectual revolution which ended by radically changing the texture of day-to-day research activity and discourse throughout almost all of linguistics, and in substantial parts of other cognition-related disciplines. In decades to come, perhaps 1986 will be remembered by academics as the year of publication of the pair of volumes reviewed here: they constitute the first large-scale public statement of an intellectual paradigm fully as revolutionary as the generative paradigm ever was (there have been scattered journal articles in the preceding four or five years). I would go further and suggest that, if the promises of this book can be redeemed, the contrast in linguistics and neighboring disciplines between the 1990's and the 1970's will be significantly greater than the contrast between the 1970's and the 1950's. (I need hardly add, of course, that it is one thing to fire an opening salvo, but another to achieve ultimate predominance.) The new paradigm is called Parallel Distributed Processing by the sixteen writers who contributed to this book, many of whom work either at the University of California, San Diego, or at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Some other researchers (e.g. Feldman 1985) use the term 'connectionism' for the same concept. These two volumes comprise 26 chapters which, among them, (i) explain the over-all nature and aims of PDP/connectionist models, (ii) define a family of specific variants of the general paradigm, and (iii) exemplify it by describing experiments in which PDP models were used to simulate human performance in various cognitive domains. The experiments, inevitably, treat their respective domains in a simplified, schematic way by comparison with the endless complexity found in any real-life cognitive area; but simplification in this case does not mean trivialization. There are also auxiliary chapters on relevant related topics; thus Chap. 9, by M. I. JORDAN, is a tutorial on linear algebra, a branch of mathematics having special significance for the PDP paradigm.

The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established.

Children are typically said to pass through a three-phase acquisition process in which they first learn past tense by rote, then learn the past tense rule and over regularize, and then finally learn the exceptions to the rule. We show that the acquisition data can be accounted for in more detail by dispensing with the assumption that the child learns rules and substituting in its place a simple homogeneous learning procedure. We show how rule-like behavior can emerge from the interactions among a network of units encoding the root form to past tense mapping. A large computer simulation of the learning process demonstrates the operating principles of our alternative account, shows how details of the acquisition process not captured by the rule account emerge, and makes predictions about other details of the acquisition process not yet observed.

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

                "text": "This paper presents a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results. The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967) proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure and processing into a computer."

Such continuous semantic constraints were examined in two experiments in which subjects judged the likelihood of obtaining each of the interpretations of ambiguous sentences. The sentences were factorially generated by independently varying the degree to which semantic constraints for each interpretation were satisfied. In one experiment, the semantic constraints were manipulated by varying critical words within the ambiguous sentence; in the other experiment, a preceding context sentence was used. The results of both experiments supported the hypotheses that the judged likelihood was a direct function of the relative sensibleness of the interpretations, that semantic constraints determined the degree of sensibleness of each interpretation, and that these semantic constraints are continuous restrictions which are independent of each other and stable from sentence to sentence in which they occur."
