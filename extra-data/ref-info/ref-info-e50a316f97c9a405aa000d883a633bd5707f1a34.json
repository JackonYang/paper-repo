More realistic retrieval systems take into account dependencies between certain term pairs and possibly between term triples. In this study, methods are outlined for generating dependency factors for term pairs and term triples and for using them in retrieval.

It is found that a simple duplication, by automatic means, of the standard, manual document indexing and retrieval operations will not produce acceptable output results. New mechanized approaches to document handling are proposed, including document ranking methods, automatic dictionary and word list generation, and user feedback searches.

Retrieval experiments with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents. The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative strategy."

The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collection have long been used as indicators of term importance for indexing purposes. In particular, very rare or very frequent terms are normally believed to be less effective than the medium frequency terms. Accordingly, it has been suggested that query term weights should first increase and then decrease as the document frequencies of the query terms increase. Three term weighting models (utility weights, precision weights, and discrimination value weights) are studied and they all substantiate the suggested behavior. A fourth scheme, the inverse document frequency system, is shown to be a close approximation of the precision system under certain circumstances. \nTwo of the three models require relevance information. The precision and utility weights are based on the occurrence characteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant, documents in the collection. Methods are suggested for estimating the relevant properties of the terms based on the overall occurrence characteristics in the collection. Empirical evaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the term relevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies. Experimental evidence indicates that relevance feedback is a most promising strategy. \nThe last part of the thesis demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of the Boolean and vector representations of queries. A more general framework which encompasses both the fuzzy set approach and the vector space approach is outlined. The new scheme is derived from the concept of p-norms. It is shown that the fuzzy set approach is the extreme case when p = (INFIN) while the vector space approach represents the other extreme case when p = 1."

As previous attempts have appeared not to be fully successful, the present paper suggests a more rigorous approach.

                "text": "In order for an automatic information retrieval system to effectively retrieve documents related to a given subject area, the content of each document in the system''s database must be represented accurately. This study examines the hypothesis that better representations of document content can be constructed if the content analysis method takes into consideration the syntactic structure of document and query texts. Two methods of automatically generating phrases for use as content indicators have been implemented and tested experimentally. The non-syntactic (or statistical) method is based on simple text characteristics such as word frequency and the proximity of words in text. The syntactic method uses augmented phrase structure rules (production rules) to selectively extract phrases from parse trees generated by an automatic syntactic analyzer. Experimental results show that the effect of non-syntactic phrase indexing is inconsistent. For the five collections tested, increases in average precision ranged from 22.7% to 2.2% over simple, single term indexing. The syntactic phrase indexing method was tested on two collections. Precision figures averaged over all test queries indicate that non-syntactic phrase indexing performs significantly better than syntactic phrase indexing for one collection, but that the difference is insignificant for the other collection. More detailed analysis of individual queries, however, indicates that the performance of both methods is highly variable, and that there is evidence that syntax-based indexing has certain benefits not available with the non-syntactic approach. Possible improvements of both methods of phrase indexing are considered. It is concluded that the prospects for improving the syntax-based approach to document indexing are better than for the non-syntactic approach. The PLNLP system was used for syntactic analysis of document and query texts, and for implementing the syntax-based phrase construction rules. The SMART information retrieval system was used for retrieval experimentation."

The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods."

The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of the system to respond to patron requests. This paper discusses this process, and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory. The basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both models are fully defined in this paper. Though the main purpose of this paper is to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that may prove to be of value for an automated operating system. The paper concludes with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of view of decision theory."

The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. For this reason, the vector space model adopted by Salton for the SMART system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors. In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme. We also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector based information retrieval systems. The preliminary experimental results obtained from the new model are very encouraging."

Its main concern is with the weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."

The successes of these models are unlikely to be accidental; it is of interest therefore to examine the similarities between the two models. The disadvantage of the BLE model is the exponential number of terms appearings in the full expression, while a truncated BLE system may produce negative probability values. The disadvantage of the tree dependence model is the restriction to dependencies between certain term pairs only and the exclusion of higher-order dependencies. A generalized term dependence model is introduced in this study which does not carry the disadvantages of either the tree dependence or the BLE models. Sample evaluation results are included to demonstrate the usefulness of the generalized system."

Mel'chuk et. al. is the special lexicon or ECD ('explanatory and combinatory' dictionary). This component can be thought of as a collection independent thesaurus, and can be applied to improve the effectiveness of an information retrieval system.After outlining the MTM and related work, this paper briefly describes the SMART type of information retrieval system. Applicability of the above-mentioned lexicon to such a system is discussed. In particular, the list of lexical relations included in the ECD is expanded and organized to be more effective for retrieval, partially along the lines suggested by Evens and Smith.Finally, an experimental analysis of the utility of lexical relations in an information retrieval system is discussed. It is shown that lexical relations generally enhance system performance. When all lexical relations are considered in the comparison, the resulting performance is shown, by statistical methods, to make a significant improvement (up to 16.5% at a single recall level); when all lexical relations except for antonyms are considered, the improvement is even greater (up to 20.2% at a single recall level)."

The assumptions of these models are met when documents are randomly selected from the database or when retrieving all available documents. A more suitable model for retrieval of a single document assumes that the best document available is to be retrieved first. Models of document retrieval systems assuming random selection and best-first selection are developed and compared under binary independence and two Poisson independence feature distribution models. Under the best-first model, feature discrimination varies with the number of documents in each relevance class in the database. A weight similar to the Inverse Document Frequency weight and consistent with the best-first model is suggested which does not depend on knowledge of the characteristics of relevant documents."

Within the environment of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with the K group of eight index languages which used single terms. The group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance , while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary. Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance. The use of precision devices such as links gave no advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination. All results have to be considered within the context of the experimental environment, but they can be said to substantiate or clarify many of the findings of Cranfield I. It is conclusively shown that an inverse relationship exists between recall and precision, whatever the variable may be that is being changed. The two factors which appear most likely to affect performance are the level of exhaustivity of indexing and the level of specificity of the terms in the index language. For any given operational situation, the optimum levels cannot be categorically stated in advance, but can only be determined by an evaluation of the system, the main consideration probably being the subject field. It would be unusual if the characteristics of the subject field used for this test were such as to make it unique, so the high performance obtained with the single terms in natural language can be considered to be of some importance in regard to the use of natural language text as input to mechanised systems. PREFACE It was intended that this should be the final volume of the Report on Cranfield II. This may still be the case, but as the results were being prepared for publication, we were continually aware of the gaps that needed to be filled. The delay in the appearance of this volume is partly due to attempts to obtain some of the missing data, but a great deal still remains to be done. The detailed analysis of the reasons for failure to retrieve relevant documents or for the retrieval of non-relevant documents was an important part of Cranfield \u2026"

While any document is in principle retrievable by a Boolean query, the amount of output obtainable by Boolean processing is difficult to control, and the retrieved items are not ranked in any presumed order of importance to the user population. In the vector processing model of retrieval, the retrieved items are easily ranked in decreasing order of the query-record similarity, but the queries themselves are unstructured and expressed as simple sets of weighted index terms. A new, extended Boolean information retrieval system is introduced which is intermediate between the Boolean system of query processing and the vector processing model. The query structure inherent in the Boolean system is preserved, while at the same time weighted terms may be incorporated into both queries and stored documents; the retrieved output can also be ranked in strict similarity order with the user queries. A conventional retrieval system can be modified to make use of the extended system. Laboratory tests indicate that the extended system produces better retrieval output than either the Boolean or the vector processing systems."
