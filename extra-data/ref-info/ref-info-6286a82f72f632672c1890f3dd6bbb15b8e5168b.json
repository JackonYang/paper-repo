The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

Our work is motivated by the continuing effort in content-based image retrieval to extract and to model the semantic content of images. The basic idea of the semantic modeling is to classify local image regions into semantic concept classes such as water, rocks, or foliage. Images are represented through the frequency of occurrence of these local concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the image representation is well suited for modeling the semantic content of heterogenous scene categories, and thus for categorization and retrieval.The image representation also allows us to rank natural scenes according to their semantic similarity relative to certain scene categories. Based on human ranking data, we learn a perceptually plausible distance measure that leads to a high correlation between the human and the automatically obtained typicality ranking. This result is especially valuable for content-based image retrieval where the goal is to present retrieval results in descending semantic similarity from the query."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g, bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information. In this paper we propose a prototype based model that can successfully combine both sources of information. To test our approach we created a dataset of 67 indoor scenes categories (the largest available) covering a wide range of domains. The results show that our approach can significantly outperform a state of the art classifier for the task."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

Intuitively, annotations provide evidence for the class label, and the class label provides evidence for annotations. For example, an image of class highway is more likely annotated with words \u201croad,\u201d \u201ccar,\u201d and \u201ctraffic\u201d than words \u201cfish,\u201d \u201cboat,\u201d and \u201cscuba.\u201d In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic model for jointly modeling the image, its class label, and its annotations. Our model treats the class label as a global description of the image, and treats annotation terms as local descriptions of parts of the image. Its underlying probabilistic assumptions naturally integrate these two sources of information. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithms based on variational methods, as well as efficient approximations for classifying and annotating new images. We examine the performance of our model on two real-world image data sets, illustrating that a single model provides competitive annotation performance, and superior classification performance."

Our first method - \u201cattribute\u201d classifiers - uses binary classifiers trained to recognize the presence or absence of describable aspects of visual appearance (e.g., gender, race, and age). Our second method - \u201csimile\u201d classifiers - removes the manual labeling required for attribute classification and instead learns the similarity of faces, or regions of faces, to specific reference people. Neither method requires costly, often brittle, alignment between image pairs; yet, both methods produce compact visual descriptions, and work on real-world images. Furthermore, both the attribute and simile classifiers improve on the current state-of-the-art for the LFW data set, reducing the error rates compared to the current best by 23.92% and 26.34%, respectively, and 31.68% when combined. For further testing across pose, illumination, and expression, we introduce a new data set - termed PubFig - of real-world images of public figures (celebrities and politicians) acquired from the internet. This data set is both larger (60,000 images) and deeper (300 images per individual) than existing data sets of its kind. Finally, we present an evaluation of human performance."

We define an event in a static image as a human activity taking place in a specific environment. In this paper, we use a number of sport games such as snow boarding, rock climbing or badminton to demonstrate event classification. Our goal is to classify the event in the image as well as to provide a number of semantic labels to the objects and scene environment within the image. For example, given a rowing scene, our algorithm recognizes the event as rowing by classifying the environment as a lake and recognizing the critical objects in the image as athletes, rowing boat, water, etc. We achieve this integrative and holistic recognition through a generative graphical model. We have assembled a highly challenging database of 8 widely varied sport events. We show that our system is capable of classifying these event classes at 73.4% accuracy. While each component of the model contributes to the final recognition, using scene or objects alone cannot achieve this performance."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Our goal is to examine how many concepts would be needed, and how they should be selected and used. Simulating performance of video retrieval under different assumptions of concept detection accuracy, we find that good retrieval can be achieved even when detection accuracy is low, if sufficiently many concepts are combined. We also derive suggestions regarding the types of concepts that would be most helpful for a large concept lexicon. Since our user study finds that people cannot predict which concepts will help their query, we also suggest ways to find the best concepts to use. Ultimately, this paper concludes that \"concept-based\" video retrieval with fewer than 5000 concepts, detected with a minimal accuracy of 10% mean average precision is likely to provide high accuracy results in broadcast news retrieval."

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets.

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

The model is made up of several texture-mapped planar billboards and has the complexity of a typical children's pop-up book illustration. Our main insight is that instead of attempting to recover precise geometry, we statistically model geometric classes defined by their orientations in the scene. Our algorithm labels regions of the input image into coarse categories: \"ground\", \"sky\", and \"vertical\". These labels are then used to \"cut and fold\" the image into a pop-up model using a set of simple assumptions. Because of the inherent ambiguity of the problem and the statistical nature of the approach, the algorithm is not expected to work on every image. However. it performs surprisingly well for a wide range of scenes taken from a typical person's photo album."

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

We describe a method based on $\\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression, in which the neighborhood of any given node is estimated by performing logistic regression subject to an $\\ell_1$-constraint. The method is analyzed under high-dimensional scaling in which both the number of nodes $p$ and maximum neighborhood size $d$ are allowed to grow as a function of the number of observations $n$. Our main results provide sufficient conditions on the triple $(n,p,d)$ and the model parameters for the method to succeed in consistently estimating the neighborhood of every node in the graph simultaneously. With coherence conditions imposed on the population Fisher information matrix, we prove that consistent neighborhood selection can be obtained for sample sizes $n=\\Omega(d^3\\log p)$ with exponentially decaying error. When these same conditions are imposed directly on the sample matrices, we show that a reduced sample size of $n=\\Omega(d^2\\log p)$ suffices for the method to estimate neighborhoods consistently. Although this paper focuses on the binary graphical models, we indicate how a generalization of the method of the paper would apply to general discrete Markov random fields."

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis\u2010of\u2010variance problem as the most important and well\u2010known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non\u2010negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non\u2010negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods."
