In such an environment, writing, drawing, and gesturing with a stylus become the primary means of communication between the user and the underlying system. One approach is to treat electronic ink as a first-class datatype [Aref et al. 1995a]. It is possible to imagine a system that directly supports handwritten documents and file names, hand-drawn pictures, handwritten email messages, and the like. Representing, maintaining, and efficiently handling this new form of data raises some interesting research questions. For example, users will need to refer to files using their handwritten names, and search for information\u2014 either textual or graphical-previously saved in a document. Here we discuss a new paradigm for pen computing based on bringing key functionality closer to the user, implementing it directly via electronic ink."

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

The recognition-based approach reported here is novel in that it expands documents in a fashion analogous to query expansion: Individual documents are expanded using N-best lists which embody additional statistical information from a hidden Markov model (HMM) based handwriting recognizer used to transcribe each of the handwritten documents. This additional information enables the retrieval methods to be robust to machine transcription errors, retrieving documents which otherwise would be unretrievable. Cross-writer experiments on a database of 10985 words in 108 documents from 108 writers, and within-writer experiments in a probabilistic framework, on a database of 537724 words in 3342 documents from 43 writers, indicate that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved. The second database is the largest database of on-line handwritten documents known to its."

We propose a stringmatching-based method for word-spotting in on-line documents.The retrieval algorithm achieves a precision of92.3% at a recall rate of 90% on a database of 6,672 wordswritten by 10 different writers.

This field continues to draw a lot of attention from researchers because there are a number of applications where the pen is the most convenient form of input. These include: 1. preparing a first draft of a document and concentrating on content creation; 2. a socially acceptable form of capturing information in meetings, that is quieter than typing and creates minimal visual barrier; 3. applications that need privacy; 4. entering letters in ideographic languages like Chinese and Japanese and non-letter entries like graphics, music and gestures; and 5. interaction with multi-modal systems. The advent of electronic tablets in the late 1950s precipitated considerable activity in the area of pen computing. This interest ebbed in the 1970's, and was renewed in the 1980's, primarily due to advances in pen hardware technology and improvement in user-interfaces and handwriting recognition algorithms. There are still however, a number of challenges that need to be addressed before pen computing can address the needs listed above to a acceptable level of user satisfaction. In the paper, an overview of three aspects of pen computing are presented: pen input hardware, handwriting recognition and pen computer applications."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

The pen trajectory is recorded by a touch sensitive pad, such as those used by note-pad computers. The input to the system contains the pen trajectory information, encoded as a time-ordered sequence of feature vectors. Features include X and Y coordinates, pen-lifts, speed, direction and curvature of the pen trajectory. A time delay neural network with local connections and shared weights is used to estimate a posteriori probabilities for characters in a word. A hidden Markov model segments the word into characters in a way which optimizes the global word score, taking a dictionary into account. A geometrical normalization scheme and a fast but efficient dictionary search are also presented. Trained on 20000 unconstrained cursive words from 59 writers and using a 25000 word dictionary the authors reached a 89% character and 80% word recognition rate on test data from a disjoint set of writers.<<ETX>>"

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

The basic idea is to segment each cursive string into a set of strokes. Each of these strokes can be described with a set of features and, thus, can be stored as points in the feature space. The Karhuraen-Lor%e transform is then used to minimize the number of features used (data dimensionality) and thus the index size. Feature vectors are stored in an R-tree. Similarity search can be performed by executing a few range queries and then applying a simple voting algorithm to the output to select the strings that are most similar to the query. The proposed index can support similarity queries as well as substring mat thing. It is resilient to the kind of errors that result from the segmentation process, namely, stroke insertion/deletion and m-n substitution. The proposed index achieves substantial saving in search time over the sequential search. Moreover, it improves the matching rate up to 46~0 over the the sequential search."

Because of the large overlap of the character sets found in English and major Western European languages such as French and German, some extensions of the basic English capability to those languages have taken place. However, automatic language identification prior to optical character recognition is not commonly available and adds utility to such systems. Languages and their scripts have attributes that make it possible to determine the language of a document automatically. Detection of the values of these attributes requires the recognition of particular features of the document image and, in the case of languages using Latin-based symbols, the character syntax of the underlying language. We have developed techniques for distinguishing which language is represented in an image of text. This work is restricted to a small but important subset of the world's languages. The method first classifies the script into two broad classes: Han-based and Latin-based. This classification is based on the spatial relationships of features related to the upward concavities in character structures. Language identification within the Han script class (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is performed by analysis of the distribution of optical density in the text images. We handle 23 Latin-based languages using a technique based on character shape codes, a representation of Latin text that is inexpensive to compute."

The proposed algorithm is a fast and satisfactorily accurate procedure for isolating text lines without loss of information. The algorithm is based on the analysis of horizontal run projections and connected component grouping and splitting on a partition of the input image into vertical strips, in order to deal with undulating or skewed text. The goal of the algorithm is to prevent the ascending and descending characters from being corrupted by arbitrary cuts. The algorithm has been designed for cursive text and can also be applied to handwritten text.

In an attempt to move toward a paperless office, large quantities of printed documents are often scanned and archived as images, without adequate index information. One way to provide traditional data-base indexing and retrieval capabilities is to fully convert the document to an electronic representation which can be indexed automatically. Unfortunately, there are many factors which prohibit complete conversion including high cost, low document quality, and the fact that many nontext components cannot be adequately represented in a converted form. In such cases, it can be advantageous to maintain a copy of and use the document in image form. In this paper, we provide a survey of methods developed by researchers to access and manipulate document images without the need for complete and accurate conversion. We briefly discuss traditional text indexing techniques on imperfect data and the retrieval of partially converted documents. This is followed by a more comprehensive review of techniques for the direct characterization, manipulation, and retrieval, of images of documents containing text, graphics, and scene images."

The proposed technique involves two major stages: symbol recognition and structural analysis. A multiple-classifier consists of both parametric and nonparametric classifier has been used for recognition of symbols. Parametric classifier is based on hidden Markov model (HMM), whereas, non-parametric classifier uses Nearest Neighbor classification scheme. Structural analysis uses several online and offline features to identify the spatial relationships among symbols. A context free grammar has been designed to convert input expressions into their corresponding Latex strings. Contextual information has been used to correct several errors occurring at both recognition and structural analysis stage. A new method for evaluating performance of the proposed systems has been formulated. Experiments on a dataset of considerable size show high efficiency of the proposed system."

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models, are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and for making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough in characterizing printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice \"elastic matching\" property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database that contains about 26000 words. Currently, the authors achieve a recognition accuracy of 99% when words in testing and training sets are of the same font size, and 96% when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM achieves only a 70% accuracy rate. >"

An efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis, and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables, images, drawings, and rulers. We use the traditional bottom-up approach based on the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval, transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation, segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2550/spl times/3300 image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise."

There are three major applications for such a process. Archives of publications containing both text and line illustrations; human-machine interface; and integration of electronic CAD systems with the paper archives. The automation of this process involves the following steps: (1) Digitization (2) Conversions into binary form (3) Discrimination between solid, halftone, and line area and extraction of line information. (4) Discrimination between symbols (text) and graphics. (5) Recognition of text. (6) Normalization of graphics. (7) Recognition of graphics. The major challenges are the use of gray scale images to extract line information (relevant to steps 2 and 3) and the recognition of schematics and graphics (relevent to steps 6 and 7)."

The framework uses the writer independent system to get an initial alignment of the writer's data. The system described reduces the error rate by an average of 65%.

Fast processing is essential since the user expects to receive the results of a keyword search many times faster than the actual length of the speech. A number of computational short-cuts to the standard Viterbi word-spotter are presented. These are based on exploiting the background Viterbi phone recognition path that is computed to provide a normalisation base. An initial approximation using the phone transition boundaries reduces the retrieval time by a factor of 5, while achieving a slight improvement in word-spotting performance. To further reduce retrieval time, pattern matching, feature selection, and Gaussian selection techniques are applied to this approximate pass to give a total /spl times/50 increase in speed with little loss in performance. In addition, a low memory requirement means that these approaches can be implemented on any platform, including hand-held devices."

In this model, on-line handwriting is considered as a modulation of a simple cycloidal pen motion, described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of the writing. By slow modulations of the amplitudes and phase lags of the two oscillators, a general pen trajectory can be efficiently encoded. These parameters are then quantized into a small number of values without altering the writing intelligibility. A general procedure for the estimation and quantization of these cycloidal motion parameters for arbitrary handwriting is presented. The result is a discrete motor control representation of the continuous pen motion, via the quantized levels of the model parameters. This motor control representation enables successful word spotting and matching of cursive scripts. Our experiments clearly indicate the potential of this dynamic representation for complete cursive handwriting recognition."

The main criticism of the existing techniques is that most of them rely on either connected component analysis or character segmentation. We go on to present a new method based on texture analysis for script identification which does not require character segmentation. A uniform text block on which texture analysis can be performed is produced from a document image via simple processing. Multiple channel (Gabor) filters and grey level co-occurrence matrices are used in independent experiments in order to extract texture features. Classification of test documents is made based on the features of training documents using the K-NN classifier. Initial results of over 95% accuracy on the classification of 105 rest decrements from 7 scripts are very promising. The method shows robustness with respect to noise, the presence of foreign characters or numerals, and can be applied to very small amounts of text."

The NPen++ recognition engine is based on a multi-state time delay neural network and yields recognition rates from 96% for a 5,000 word dictionary to 93.4% on a 20,000 word dictionary and 91.2% for a 50,000 word dictionary. The proposed tree search and pruning technique reduces the search space considerably without losing too much recognition performance compared to an exhaustive search. This enables the NPen++ recognizer to be run in real-time with large dictionaries. Initial recognition rates for whole sentences are promising and show that the MS-TDNN architecture is suited to recognizing handwritten data ranging from single characters to whole sentences."

The general approach is a ``bottom-up'' clustering of discrete strokes into small groups that are then merged into isolated lines of text. Initial clustering of strokes into groups is based on combined temporal and spatial stroke proximity. Spatial stroke proximity is gauged relative to estimated inter-line distance and mean character height. Two methods applicable to off-line or on-line data are described for estimating the inter-line distance: autocorrelation (self-convolution) of the Y-axis projection histogram, and a fitting function. Inter-line distance is accurately determined for 99% of all text pages. Text line extraction accuracy on letters (correspondence) is 98.7% and on tables is 94.9%."

A visual word spotting scheme that would serve these purposes is a challenging task even when the transcription of the document image is available. We propose a framework for mapping each word in the transcript to the associated word image in the document. Coarse word mapping based on document constraints is used for lexicon reduction. Then, word mappings are refined using word recognition results by a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the best match while satisfying the constraints."

The prototypical T-Recs system (Table RECognition System) relies on the word level layout (bounding box geometry) as primary input. It moreover considers the textual information and potentially available delineations as further input. This article resumes the basic ideas and system features as described in [1] and [2] (downloadable from our demo page: www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ kieni/t recs/). This page also allows to interactivly load and change some prede ned documents which demonstrate the main features and strengths of the approach. Next, we will sketch some problems which encounter when applying T-Recs to business letters like o ers, invoices etc. and discuss appropriate solutions for that problem. 1 SUMMARY OF CURRENT SYSTEM Based on the word level layout information which can be derived from either OCR documents (e.g. the Xerox XDOC-format) or plain ASCII les by using a built-in preprocessor, the TRecs system performs a direct bottom-up clustering of word segments to blocks (not the conventional word-line-block order!) and thus transforms the document representation from the word level layout to a partial logical representation (see Figure 1).

This is especially true in the case of documents that are exchanged over the Internet, which could be accessed and modified by intruders. The most popular methods used for authentication of digital documents are public key encryption-based authentication and digital watermarking. Traditional watermarking techniques embed a pre-determined character string, such as the company logo, in a document. We propose a fragile watermarking system, which uses an on-line signature of the author as the watermark in a document. The embedding of a biometric characteristic such as signature in a document enables us to verify the identity of the author using a set of reference signatures, in addition to ascertaining the document integrity. The receiver of the document reconstructs the signature used to watermark the document, which is then used to verify the author's claimed identity. The paper presents a signature encoding scheme, which facilitates reconstruction by the receiver, while reducing the chances of collusion attacks."

                "text": "Gesture-based interfaces, in which the user specifies commands by simple freehand drawings, offer an alternative to traditional keyboard, menu, and direct manipulation interfaces. The ability to specify objects, an operation, and additional parameters with a single intuitive gesture makes gesture-based systems appealing to both novice and experienced users. \nUnfortunately, the difficulty in building gesture-based systems has prevented such systems from being adequately explored. This dissertation presents work that attempts to alleviate two of the major difficulties: the construction of gesture classifiers and the integration of gestures into direct-manipulation interfaces. Three example gesture-based applications were built to demonstrate this work. \nGesture-based systems require classifiers to distinguish between the possible gestures a user may enter. In the past, classifiers have often been hand-coded for each new application, making them difficult to build, change, and maintain. This dissertation applies elementary statistical pattern recognition techniques to produce gesture classifiers that are trained by example, greatly simplifying their creation and maintenance. Both single-path gestures (drawn with a mouse or stylus) and multiple-path gestures (consisting of the simultaneous paths of multiple fingers) may be classified. On a 1 MIPS workstation, a 30-class single-path recognizer takes 175 milliseconds to train (once the examples have been entered), and classification takes 9 milliseconds, typically achieving 97% accuracy. A method for classifying a gesture as soon as it is unambiguous is also presented. \nThis dissertation also describes GRANDMA, a toolkit for building gesture-based applications based on Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller paradigm. Using GRANDMA, one associates sets of gesture classes with individual views or entire view classes. A gesture class can be specified at runtime by entering a few examples of the class, typically 15. The semantics of a gesture class can be specified at runtime via a simple programming interface. Besides allowing for easy experimentation with gesture-based interfaces, GRANDMA sports a novel input architecture, capable of supporting multiple input devices and multi-threaded dialogues. The notion of virtual tools and semantic feedback are shown to arise naturally from GRANDMA's approach."

To extract the shape information, a number of shape estimators are applied to each stroke to provide a soft decision about how similar it is to a particular shape type. Then, two strokes are matched according to a specific set of features for each shape type. The proximity of the corresponding strokes is used to account for the geometric relationship between multiple strokes during the matching stage. Our approach is robust to different drawing styles, thus making our retrieval system user-independent. Sketch retrieval is useful in applications where a user can easily search through a database of hand-draw sketches by inputting a sketch about what he/she is looking for, without the trouble of describing it using keywords."

Rotation invariant texture features are computed based on an extension of the popular multi-channel Gabor filtering technique, and their effectiveness is tested with 300 randomly rotated samples of 15 Brodatz textures. These features are then used in an attempt to solve a practical but hitherto mostly overlooked problem in document image processing-the identification of the script of a machine printed document. Automatic script and language recognition is an essential front-end process for the efficient and correct use of OCR and language translation products in a multilingual environment.

Automatic recognition of mathematical expressions is one of the key vehicles in the drive towards transcribing documents in scientific and engineering disciplines into electronic form. This problem typically consists of two major stages, namely, symbol recognition and structural analysis. In this survey paper, we will review most of the existing work with respect to each of the two major stages of the recognition process. In particular, we try to put emphasis on the similarities and differences between systems. Moreover, some important issues in mathematical expression recognition will be addressed in depth. All these together serve to provide a clear overall picture of how this research area has been developed to date."

For each candidate destination address block (DAB), the address block location (ABL) system determines the line segmentation, global orientation, block skew, an indication of whether the address appears to be handwritten or machine printed, and a value indicating the degree of confidence that the block actually contains the destination address. With 20-MHz Sparc processors, the average time per mail piece for the combined hardware and software system components is 0.210 seconds. The system located 89.0% of the addresses as the top choice. Recent developments in the system include the use of a top-down segmentation tool, address syntax analysis using only connected component data, and improvements to the segmentation refinement routines.

In this framework, a logical document structure is a message communicated by encoding the structure as an ideal image, transmitting the ideal image through a noisy channel, and decoding the degraded image into a logical structure as close to the original message as possible, on average. Thus document image decoding is document image recognition where the recognizer performs optimal reconstruction by explicitly modeling the source of logical structures, the encoding procedure, and the channel noise. In previous work, we modeled the source and encoder using probabilistic finite-state automata and transducers. In this paper, we generalize the source and encoder models using context-free attribute grammars. We employ these models in a document image decoder that uses a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the probability of error between original and reconstructed structures. The dynamic programming algorithm is a generalization of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami parsing algorithm."

Our method is based on the use of a multiscale Bayesian framework. This framework is chosen because it allows accurate modeling of both the image characteristics and contextual structure of each region. The parameters which describe the characteristics of typical images are extracted from a database of training images which are produced by scanning typical documents and hand segmenting them into the desired components. This training procedure is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and results in approximate maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the model parameters for region textures and contextual structure at various resolutions. Once the training procedure is performed, scanned documents may be segmented using a fine-to-coarse-to-fine procedure that is computationally efficient."

Digital audio, video, and pictures are increasingly furnished with distinguishing but imperceptible marks, which may contain a hidden copyright notice or serial number or even help to prevent unauthorized copying directly. Military communications systems make increasing use of traffic security techniques which, rather than merely concealing the content of a message using encryption, seek to conceal its sender, its receiver, or its very existence. Similar techniques are used in some mobile phone systems and schemes proposed for digital elections. Criminals try to use whatever traffic security properties are provided intentionally or otherwise in the available communications systems, and police forces try to restrict their use. However, many of the techniques proposed in this young and rapidly evolving field can trace their history back to antiquity, and many of them are surprisingly easy to circumvent. In this article, we try to give an overview of the field, of what we know, what works, what does not, and what are the interesting topics for research."

Unconstrained Devanagari writing is more complex than English cursive due to the possible variations in the order, number, directional and shape of the constituent strokes. An online pen computing environment has numerous application in providing an easy human interface for a complex script like Devanagari. A Devanagari character recognition experiment with 20 different writers with each writer writing 5 samples of each character in a totally unconstrained way, has been conducted. An accuracy of 86.5% with no rejects is achieved through the combination of multiple classifiers that focus on either local online properties, or global off-line properties. Further improvements in performance are expected by using word-level contextual information. We also explore the use of writer dependent models to improve the recognition accuracy."

The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap."

While there is not yet an \u201cAltaVista\u201d for the audio data type, many workers are finding ways to automatically locate, index, and browse audio using recent advances in speech recognition and machine listening. This paper reviews the state of the art in audio information retrieval, and presents recent advances in automatic speech recognition, word spotting, speaker and music identification, and audio similarity with a view towards making audio less \u201copaque\u201d. A special section addresses intelligent interfaces for navigating and browsing audio and multimedia documents, using automatically derived information to go beyond the tape recorder metaphor."

In this model, the velocity of handwriting trajectory is modeled as the impulse response of a time varying second order system. For mathematical tractability, the entire trajectory is segmented into several non-overlapping frames, while the natural frequency and the damping factor of the system are assumed to vary linearly with time in each frame and are continuous along the entire trajectory. In other words, handwriting is regarded as an oscillation modulated by a continuous and piecewise linear signal. The parameters of this model are estimated by Powell's optimization algorithm which does not require the computation of the first order derivative. The number and lengths of the frames are decided by a modified binary search algorithm along with the estimation of parameters. This model has achieved very high data compression rate as well as accurate reproduction of real handwriting."

A document recognition problem is viewed as consisting of three elements-an image generator, a noisy channel, and an image decoder. A document image generator is a Markov source which combines a message source with an imager. The message source produces a string of symbols which contains the information to be transmitted. The imager is modeled as a finite-state transducer, which converts the message into an ideal bitmap. The channel transforms the ideal image into a noisy observed image. The decoder estimates the message from the observed image by finding the a posteriori most probable path through the combined source and channel models using a Viterbi-like algorithm. Application of the proposed method to decoding telephone yellow pages is described.<<ETX>>"

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval, a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color, shape, or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition, cancer cell detection, etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact, semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics. In practice, the design of such primitives is non-trivial, and is driven by a number of conflicting real-world constraints (e.g. computation time vs. accuracy). The virage engine provides an open framework for developers to 'plug-in' primitives to solve specific image management problems. The architecture has been designed to support both static images and video in a unified paradigm. The infrastructure provided by the Virage engine can be utilized to address high-level problems as well, such as automatic, unsupervised keyword assignment, or image classification."

Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition, who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular, context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations, and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures, presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory. The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages, and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978). As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows."

The most common utility of a watermarked image is (1) for image viewing and display, and (2) for extracting the embedded watermark in subsequent copy protection applications. The issue is often centered on the robustness of the watermark for detection and extraction. In addition to robustness studies, a fundamental question will center on the utilization value of the watermarked images beyond perceptual quality evaluation. Essentially we have to study how the watermarks inserted affect the subsequent processing and utility of images, and what watermarking schemes we can develop that will cater to these processing tasks. This work focuses on the study of watermarking on images used in automatic personal identification technology based fingerprints. We investigate the effects of watermarking fingerprint images on the recognition and retrieval accuracy using a proposed invisible fragile watermarking technique for image verification applications on a specific fingerprint recognition system. We shall also describe the watermarking scheme, fingerprint recognition and feature extraction techniques used. We believe that watermarking of images will provided value-added protection, as well as copyright notification capability, to the fingerprint data collection processes and subsequent usage."

This method is intended for use in image verification applications to determine whether the content of an image has been altered, due perhaps, to the act of a malicious party. It consists of both a watermarking pro- cess which stamps a watermark into a source image without visual degradation, and a watermark extraction process which extracts a watermark from a stamped image. The extracted watermark can be compared with the embedded watermark to determine whether the image has been altered. The processing used in the watermarking and watermark extraction processes will be presented in this paper. In addition, we shall describe some modifications that provide better security, and an adaptation of the scheme to watermark JPEG im- ages. Experimental results are reported. Some advantages of this technique over other invisible watermarking techniques for verifica- tion will be discussed; these include a high degree of invisibility, color preservation, ease of extraction, and a high degree of protec- tion against the retention of a correct watermark after alteration by a malicious party. \u00a9 1998 SPIE and IS&T.

Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means.

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

Retrieval by shape similarity, given a user-sketched template is particularly challenging, owing to the difficulty to derive a similarity measure that closely conforms to the common perception of similarity by humans. In this paper, we present a technique which is based on elastic matching of sketched templates over the shapes in the images to evaluate similarity ranks. The degree of matching achieved and the elastic deformation energy spent by the sketch to achieve such a match are used to derive a measure of similarity between the sketch and the images in the database and to rank images to be displayed. The elastic matching is integrated with arrangements to provide scale invariance and take into account spatial relationships between objects in multi-object queries. Examples from a prototype system are expounded with considerations about the effectiveness of the approach and comparative performance analysis."

The crux of the method is the representation of a word by a spatial (planar) point process evolving on a regular lattice of coordinate pairs. This is accomplished by extracting the coordinate pairs, i.e. pixel locations, where the binary bitmap values of the word are non-zero. With this representation the word is completely determined by the spatial intensity function, i.e. the unnormalized spatial probability density function, associated with the extracted set of coordinate pairs. In this work, we use a finite number of moments of the intensity function to characterize the word. Location and scale invariance are obtained by transforming the coordinate pairs to have zero mean and unit variance. Finally, optimal detection strategies are applied to the moments to make the decision."

We specifically address the problem of fragile digital watermarking for the tamper proofing of still images. Applications of our problem include authentication for courtroom evidence, insurance claims, and journalistic photography. We present a novel fragile watermarking approach which embeds a watermark in the discrete wavelet domain of the image by quantizing the corresponding coefficients. Tamper detection is possible in localized spatial and frequency regions. Unlike previously proposed techniques, this novel approach provides information on specific frequencies of the image that have been modified. This allows the user to make application-dependent decisions concerning whether an image, which is JPEG compressed for instance, still has credibility. Analysis is provided to evaluate the performance of the technique to varying system parameters. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed method to existing fragile watermarking techniques to demonstrate the success and potential of the method for practical multimedia tamper proofing and authentication."

                "text": "Handwriting production is viewed as a constrained modulation of an underlying oscillatory process. Coupled oscillations in horizontal and vertical directions produce letter forms, and when superimposed on a rightward constant velocity horizontal sweep result in spatially separated letters. Modulation of the vertical oscillation is responsible for control of letter height. Modulation of the horizontal oscillation is responsible for control of corner shape through altering phase or amplitude. The vertical velocity zero crossing in the velocity space diagram is important from the standpoint of control. Changing the horizontal velocity value at this zero crossing controls corner shape. Changing the slope at this zero crossing controls writing slant. The corner shape and slant constraints completely determine the amplitude and phase relations between the two oscillations. This theory applies generally to a number of acceleration oscillation patterns such as sinusoidal rectangular and trapezoidal oscillations. The oscillation theory also provides an explanation for how handwriting might degenerate with speed. An implementation of the theory in the context of the spring muscle model is developed. Here sinusoidal oscillations arise from a purely mechanical source; orthogonal antagonistic spring pairs generate particular cycloids depending on the initial conditions. Modulating between cycloids can be achieved by changing the spring zero settings at the appropriate times. Frequency can be modulated either by shifting between coactivation and alternating activation of the antagonistic springs or by presuming variable spring constant springs. An acceleration and position measuring apparatus was developed for measurements of human handwriting. Measurements of human writing are consistent with the oscillation theory."

The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification)."

A digital watermark is information that is imperceptibly and robustly embedded in the host data such that it cannot be removed. A watermark typically contains information about the origin, status, or recipient of the host data. In this tutorial paper, the requirements and applications for watermarking are reviewed. Applications include copyright protection, data monitoring, and data tracking. The basic concepts of watermarking systems are outlined and illustrated with proposed watermarking methods for images, video, audio, text documents, and other media. Robustness and security aspects are discussed in detail. Finally, a few remarks are made about the state of the art and possible future developments in watermarking technology."

The approach takes the structure of layout elements in books and journals to be part of a semiotic system, which therefore can be described using methods developed for the description of other semiotic systems, e.g. languages. It differs from previous research in the domain of document analysis and understanding as it deals in an exhaustive way with rather generic classes of multi\u2010page printed objects, i.e. books (monographs) and journals. To achieve this aim, abstract relations instead of document specific formatting rules are taken into account."

Prior knowledge of an object shape is described by a prototype template which consists of the representative contour/edges, and a set of probabilistic deformation transformations on the template. A Bayesian scheme, which is based on this prior knowledge and the edge information in the input image, is employed to find a match between the deformed template and objects in the image. Computational efficiency is achieved via a coarse-to-fine implementation of the matching algorithm. Our method has been applied to retrieve objects with a variety of shapes from images with complex background. The proposed scheme is invariant to location, rotation, and moderate scale changes of the template."

We present a fingerprint image watermarking method that can embed facial information into host fingerprint images. This scheme has the advantage that in addition to fingerprint matching, the recovered face during the decoding can be used to establish the authenticity of the fingerprint and the user. By computing the ROC curves on a fingerprint database of 160 individuals, we show the advantages of the proposed watermarking scheme. Further, our scheme does not introduce any significant degradation in the fingerprint matching performance."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

To achieve segmentation, we propose a hierarchical approach which at each step minimizes a cost function on the space of partitions with connected components of a graph.

The adjective \"unsupervised\" is justified by two properties of the algorithm: 1) it is capable of selecting the number of components and 2) unlike the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, it does not require careful initialization. The proposed method also avoids another drawback of EM for mixture fitting: the possibility of convergence toward a singular estimate at the boundary of the parameter space. The novelty of our approach is that we do not use a model selection criterion to choose one among a set of preestimated candidate models; instead, we seamlessly integrate estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. Our technique can be applied to any type of parametric mixture model for which it is possible to write an EM algorithm; in this paper, we illustrate it with experiments involving Gaussian mixtures. These experiments testify for the good performance of our approach."

A quadratic law is derived to predict the movement time as a function of the various parameters describing the neuromuscular synergy. Conditions for a simplified description of the process, using a power law, are also presented. It is predicted that movement time can be controlled at the input level by the ratio of the agonist to antagonist commands or at the system level by modifying the total log-time delay or the log-response time of the agonist or antagonist neuromuscular networks. Adapting this approach to the specific case of movements executed under different spatial accuracy demands, it is found that movement time is linked to the inverse of the relative spatial error by similar laws. The whole approach is used to explain within a single framework all the observations that have been reported concerning speed/accuracy trade-offs. Strategies for controlling movement amplitude and duration are analyzed, and other predictions dealing with EMG, acceleration patterns, load effects and changes in the asymmetry of the velocity profile are also discussed."

The theory relies on a model of a synergy made up of two neuromuscular systems, one agonist and the other antagonist to the movement. Representing these systems with lognormal impulse responses, it is predicted that the velocity profile of a fast movement will be described by a delta-lognormal equation. So far, many studies have been conducted to test and empirically validate the theory. This paper presents an extended mathematical proof of the model. The proof is based on the Central Limit Theorem under the assumption that a law of proportionate effect governs the cumulative time delays of a sequence of dependent subprocesses constituting a neuromuscular system. Furthermore, a detailed interpretation of the parameters of the delta-lognormal equation, in terms of movement time and amplitude, response time and time delays, is discussed, providing new insights into the properties of the model with respect to neuromuscular system activity and movement generation."

This paper describes the kinematic and kinetic properties of simple rapid movements using a single and unique framework based on a delta-lognormal law (Plamondon 1993a,b, 1995a,b). Predictions concerning isotonic measurements are made using the properties of acceleration profiles, as described by the first time derivative of the delta-lognormal law. Predictions dealing with isometric measurements are directly analyzed using the delta-lognormal law, after demonstrating the experimental equivalence between isometric forces and virtual velocity profiles. The theory is also used to make statistical predictions about the variability of numerous kinematic and kinetic variables. The overall approach can be viewed as if, at some level of representation, the central nervous system were planning, executing and evaluating simple rapid movements in terms of momentum and energy instead of forces. The unifying perspective provided by the theory constitutes a powerful tool with which to study and analyze movements under numerous experimental conditions, using a single analytical law.\n"

It is shown that these systems have a log-normal impulse response that results from the limiting behavior of a large number of interdependent neuromuscular networks, as predicted by the central limit theorem. The delta log-normal law that follows from this model is very general and can reproduce almost perfectly the complete velocity patterns of an end-effector. The theory accounts for the invariance and rescalability of these patterns, as well as for the various observations that have been reported concerning the change in maximum and mean velocities, time to maximum velocity, etc., under different experimental conditions. Movement time, load effects, and control strategies are discussed in a companion paper."

I was called to the KGB office in the hospital, where the officer in charge proclaimed my freedom in a ceremonial way. He suggested that I remain in Russia as a free doctor; I would be offered a good position owing to my experience and fluent Russian. I could settle down to start a new life. The officer warned me that north Russia was the safest place at that time as Russia had just joined the war against the Nazis. I expressed my thanks and explained that my parents were in Yoshkar Ola and my duty was to find them, and that I would look for a job in a hospital to be near enough to help. The officer shook hands with me and wished me every success. I was soon on my way to Tockoye to join the new Polish army, which was assemblingthere. I subsequently served with this body in Uzbekistan, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Kenya, and Egypt. It was while in Egypt in April 1946 that I received news from my parents, who had returned to Poland from exile in Russia, that my wife, Zosia, had died in the Belzec concentration camp. Having now no reason to return to Poland, I resolved to settle in Britain and landed at Southampton from the hospital ship El Nil on 24 November 1947. I have lived in Britain ever since. Recently I received an invitation to visit the Collegium Novum in Cracow to receive an honorary degree. In view of the improving political climate there I may well go despite the strong emotions that such a visit to my native country would generate even now, nearly 50 years after I last set foot there."
