The basic terminology and concepts of probability theory include: random experiments, sample or outcome spaces (discrete and continuous case), events and their algebra, probability measures, conditional probability A First Course in Probability (8th ed.) by S. Ross. This is a lively text that covers the basic ideas of probability theory including those needed in statistics. Theoretical concepts are introduced via interesting concrete examples. In 394 I will begin my lectures with the basics of probability theory in Chapter 2. However, your first assignment is to review Chapter 1, which treats elementary counting methods. They are used in applications in Chapter 2. I expect to cover Chapters 2-5 plus portions of 6 and 7. You are encouraged to read ahead. In lectures I will not be able to cover every topic and example in Ross, and conversely, I may cover some topics/examples in lectures that are not treated in Ross. You will be responsible for all material in my lectures, assigned reading, and homework, including supplementary handouts if any."
