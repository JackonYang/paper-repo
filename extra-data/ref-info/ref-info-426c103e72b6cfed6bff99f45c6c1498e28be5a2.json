The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

The input to the system comprises blocks of text and graphics, obtained using standard image processing techniques. The fixed point model uses contextual information and features of each block to learn the layout of newspaper images and attains a contraction mapping to assign a unique label to every block. We use a hierarchical model which works in two stages. In the first stage, a semantic label (heading, sub-heading, text-blocks, image and caption) is assigned to each segmented block. The labels are then used as input to the next stage to group the related blocks into news articles. Experimental results show the applicability of our algorithm in newspaper labeling and article extraction."

The performance of our table detection system is tested on a set of document images picked from UW-III (University of Washington) dataset, UNLV dataset, video images of NPTEL videos, and our own dataset. Our approach demonstrates improved detection for different types of table layouts, with or without ruling lines. We have obtained correct table localization on pages with multiple tables aligned side-by-side."

This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

From each group of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines, a set of 26 low-level features are extracted and an SVM classifier is used to test if it belongs to a table or not. The performance of the method is evaluated on a heterogeneous corpus of French, English and Arabic documents that contain various types of table structures and compared with that of the Tesseract OCR system."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

A binary decision tree is used to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. The training and testing data sets for the algorithm include images drawn from the UWCDROM-III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, text classes (of font size pt and font size pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. The improved zone classification method raised the accuracy rate to from and reduced the median false alarm rate to from . 1 Problem Statement Let ! be a set of zone entities. Let \" be a set of content labels, such as text, table, math, etc. The function #%$&!(')\" associates each element of * with a label. The function +,$-!.'0/ specifies measurements made on each element of ! , where / is the measurement space. The zone content classification problem can be formulated as follows: Given a zone set ! and a content label set \" , find a classification function #1$2!3'4\" , that has the maximum probability: 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8 (1) In our current approach, we assume conditional independence between the zone classifications, so the probability in Equation 1 may be decomposed as 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8= @ A B 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 (2) The problem can be solved by maximizing each individual probability 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 in Equation 2, where CFE ! . In our zone content classification experiment, the elements in set ! are zone groundtruth entities from UWCDROM III document image database [6]. The elements of set \" are text with font size GIH J pt, text with font size KLH M pt, math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. + 6DC 8 is a feature vector generated for C , where CNE ! . We used a decision tree classifier to compute the probability in Equation 2 and make the assignment. 2 Related Work and Paper Organization A complete document image understanding system can transform paper documents into a hierarchical representation of their structure and content. The transformed document representation enables document interchange, editing, browsing, indexing, filing and retrieval. The zone classification technique plays the key role in the success of such a document understanding system. Not only is it useful for successive applications such as OCR, table understanding, etc, but it can be used to assist and validate document segmentation. In the literature, Sivaramakrishnan et. al [7] extracted features for each zone such as run length mean and variance, spatial mean and variance, fraction of the total number of black pixels in the zone, and the zone width ratio for each zone. They used the decision tree classifier to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. They did their experiments on MPO M document images from UWCDROM I image database. Liang et. al [5] developed a feature based zone classifier using only the knowledge of the widths and the heights of the connected components within a given zone. Le et. al [4] proposed an automated labeling of zones from scanned images with labels such as titles, authors, affiliations and abstracts. The labeling is based on features calculated from optical character recognition(OCR) output, neural network models, machine learning methods, and a set of rules that is derived from an analysis of the page layout for each journal and from generic typesetting knowledge for English text. We developed a novel background-analysis-based table identification technique. We repeated Sivaramakrishnan et. al\u2019s work [7] on a larger database with a goal to improve its performance on table zone classification. Although some background analysis techniques can be found in the literature([1],[2]), none of them, to our knowledge, has been used in the table identification problem. We added two new features: the total area of large horizontal and vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the given zone, to the original feature vector. We improved the accuracy rate and reduced the false alarm rates for most of the nine classes. The rest of this paper is divided into Q sections. section 3 gives the definitions of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks. The two new features are described in section 4. A brief introduction to the decision tree classifier is given in section 5. The experimental results are reported in section 6. Our conclusion and statement of future work are discussed in section 7."

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

In order to explore, retrieve, and reuse that data, tables should be identified and the data extracted. Table recognition is an old field of research. However, due to the diversity of table styles, the results are still far from satisfactory, and not a single algorithm performs well on all different types of tables. In this paper, we randomly take samples from the CiteSeerX to investigate diverse table styles for automatic table extraction. We find that table headers are one of the main characteristics of complex table styles. We identify a set of features that can be used to segregate headers from tabular data and build a classifier to detect table headers. Our empirical evaluation on PDF documents shows that using a Random Forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 92%.\n \n"

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables.

Some problems, such as halftone or dark area segmentation, can be in large part solved by a sequence of threshold reductions. Aspects of the approach are illustrated by the problem of identifying italic and bold words in text, using word-level extraction at lowered resolution. The computational costs of the basic operations are given, so that algorithm efficienc y can be estimated, and the importance of operating at the lowest feasable resolution is demonstrated.

In contrast to most systems which recognize tables by grouping layout information, our system uses predefined information about which table types may appear. This enables a very accurate detection able to cope with distorted tables and tables providing little layout information, e.g., no lines, bad alignment, or few rows. Table recognition starts with the detection of the table header. Afterwards, this header is compared with table headers of known reference tables. Having determined the correct reference table, the information kept in the knowledge base is utilized to compute the complete table structure. A graphical user interface allows an easy and fast specification of reference tables."

Although much work has been conducted in the domain of machine-print including books, scientific papers, etc., little has been done to address the case of handwritten inputs. In this paper, we study table detection in scanned handwritten documents subject to challenging artifacts and noise. First, we separate text components (machine-print, handwriting) from the rest of the page using an SVM classifier. We then employ a correlation-based approach to measure the coherence between adjacent text lines which may be part of the same table, solving the resulting page decomposition problem using dynamic programming. A report of preliminary results from ongoing experiments concludes the paper."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

We put forward a flexible representation scheme for complex tables, based on a clear distinction between the physical layout of a table and its logical structure. Relying on this scheme, we develop a new method for the detection and the extraction of tables by an analysis of the graphic lines. To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited."

We begin, as we do in our previous algorithm, finding and validating each detected table candidates. We proceed to compute a set of probability measurements for each of the table entities. The computation of the probability measurements takes into consideration tables, table text separators and table neighboring text blocks. Then, an iterative updating method is used to optimize the page segmentation probability to obtain the final result. This new algorithm shows a great improvement over our previous algorithm. The training and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10, 934 cell entities. Compared with our previous work, it raised the accuracy rate to 95.67% from 90.32% and to 97.05% from 92.04%."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

Recently, layered models with sequential classifiers/regressors have gained an increasing amount of interests for structural prediction. Here, we design an algorithm with a new perspective on layered models; we aim to find a fixed-point function with the structured labels being both the output and the input. Our approach alleviates the burden in learning multiple/different classifiers in different layers. We devise a training strategy for our method and provide justifications for the fixed-point function to be a contraction mapping. The learned function captures rich contextual information and is easy to train and test. On several widely used benchmark datasets, the proposed method observes significant improvement in both performance and efficiency over many state-of-the-art algorithms."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
