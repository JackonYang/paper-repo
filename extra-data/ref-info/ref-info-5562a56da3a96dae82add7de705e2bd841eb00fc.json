Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Using a fast left-right slicing method, we generate a segmentation graph that describes all possible ways to segment a word into letters. The NN computes the observation probabilities for each letter hypothesis in the segmentation graph. Then, the HMM compute the likelihood for each word in the lexicon by summing the probabilities over all possible paths through the graph. We present the preprocessing and the recognition process as well as the training procedure for the NN-HMM hybrid system. Another recognition system based on discrete HMM is also presented for performance comparison. The latter is also used for bootstrapping the NN-HMM hybrid system. Recognition performances of the two recognition systems using two image databases of French isolated words are presented. This paper is one of the first publications using the IRONOFF database, and thus can be used as a reference for future work on this database."

However, in spite of many years of research, optical readers that can recognize handwritten materials at a satisfactory rate are rare. Reasons for difficulty in reading hand-printed alphanumeric data include the variety of handwritten characters and the ambiguity in the distinction of characters. This paper proposes a new and improved recognition module designed to read the courtesy amount on Brazilian checks. This system focuses on a neural network classifier with a structural system to verify recognition which have both been designed and tailored in a unique way.

In an attempt to determine when current learning methods will cease to benefit from additional training data, we analyze residual errors made by learners when issues of sparse data have been significantly mitigated. Finally, in the context of our results, we discuss possible directions for the empirical natural language research community."
