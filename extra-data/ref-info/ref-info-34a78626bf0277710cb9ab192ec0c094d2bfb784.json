The benchmarkis designed for evaluating the performance of graphics recognition systems on images that containstraight lines (solid or dashed), circles (solid or dashed), circular arcs (solid or dashed), and textblocks. This benchmark enables an objective assessment and comparison of vectorization software.It uses practical performance evaluation methods that can be applied to complete vectorizationsystems. At a recent graphics recognition contest, three systems were evaluated using this bench-mark. The results of the contest are summarized in this paper. We hope that this benchmark willhelp assess the state of the art in graphics recognition, and highlight the strengths and weaknessesof current vectorization technology and evaluation methods. 1: Introduction Performance evaluation and benchmarking have been gaining acceptance in all areas of com-puter vision. An overview of this area is available at [1]. However, the performance evaluationof graphics recognition is still a very young \ufb01eld. Although graphics recognition systems haveexisted for several years (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5]), there has been no way to compare their performancequantitatively (some qualitative and subjective comparisons do exist, e.g., [6]). Objective and quan-titative methods for evaluation of graphics recognition systems have been proposed very recently[7,8,9,10].Kong et al. [7] propose a quantitative method for evaluating the recognition of dashed lines. Horiand Doermann [8] propose a quantitative performance measurement methodology for task-speci\ufb01craster to vector conversion. Wenyin and Dori [9] present a protocol for evaluating the recognitionof straight and circular lines. These methods do not lend themselves to an objective evaluationof a complete graphics recognition system. Some of the methods evaluate low level algorithmsand not complete systems. Other methods, although quite comprehensive, use performance metricsthat favor good recognition algorithms over good recognition systems. For instance, often the most"

The metric includes a positive set and a negative set of indices, at both the character and the character string (text) levels, _and it evaluates the detection accuracy of the location, width, height, orientation, skew, string length, and the fragmentation of both characters and strings. Assigning a Segmentation Difficulty (SD) value to the ground truth characters, the performance indices are normalized with respect to the character SD and are therefore independent of the ground truth complexity. The evaluation provides an overall, objective, and comprehensive metric of the text segmentation capability of various algorithms aimed at performing this task."

In designing and building image analysis systems, comparison of several algorithms is often required. Unfortunately, many methods of comparison do not give quantitative performance measurements, but rather qualitative, and often subjective, evaluations. Our key observation is that there is a need for domain, or task-dependent evaluation of the output. By specifying the input data in the same parameter space as the intended output of the system, we are able to evaluate the quality of the output and how well it conforms to the intended representation. We provide a set of basic metrics, but we emphasize that in general, such metrics may be task-specific. In this paper, the performance of three approaches to raster-to-vector conversion \u2014 thinning, medial line finding, and line fitting \u2014 are compared using this methodology."

Extracting these primitives during the lexical analysis phase is a prerequisite to syntactic and semantic understanding of engineering drawings within the machine drawing understanding system. Bars are detected by the orthogonal zig-zag vectorization algorithm. Some of the detected bars are linear approximations of arcs. As such, they provide the basis for arc segmentation. An arc is detected by finding a chain of bars and a triplet of points along the chain. The arc center is first approximated as the center of mass of the triangle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the chords these points define. The location of the center is refined by recursively finding more such triplets and converging to within no more than a few pixels from the actual arc center after two or three iterations. The high performance of the algorithm, demonstrated on a set of real engineering drawings, is due to the fact that it avoids both raster-to-vector and massive pixel-level operations, as well as any space transformations. >"

                "text": "Printing, photocopying and scanning processes degrade the image quality of a document. Although research in document understanding started in the sixties, only two document degradation models have been proposed thus far. Furthermore, no attempts have been made to rigorously validate them. In document understanding research, models for image degradations are crucial in many ways. Models allow us to (i) conduct controlled experiments to study the break-down points of the systems, (ii) create large data sets with groundtruth for training classifiers, (iii) design optimal noise removal algorithms, (iv) choose values for the free parameters of the algorithms, etc. \nIn this thesis two document degradation models are described. The first model accounts for local pixel-level degradations that occur while printing, photocopying and scanning a document. The second model accounts for the perspective and illumination distortions that occur while photocopying or scanning a thick, bound document. The local distortion model allows us the create large data sets of synthetically generated documents, in any language, along with the associated groundtruth information quite easily. Unlike isolated character databases, our data sets are a much better representation of the real world since they account for the real-world character and word occurrence probabilities, and character and word bi-gram probabilities naturally. Moreover, since our methodology puts the text, layout, formatting, resolution, and font details of the document image under the experimenter's control, a large variety of controlled experiments that were not possible earlier are now possible. \nNext, an automatic document registration and character groundtruthing procedure is described. This procedure produces very accurate character groundtruth for scanned documents in any language, which had not been possible until now. The method essentially registers the ideal image to a scanned version and then transforms the groundtruth associated with the ideal image through the registration transformation. This method can be used to generate groundtruth for documents in any language, and even FAXed documents. A data set having 33 English scanned document images with character groundtruth for 62000 symbols was created using this procedure. \nA non-parametric statistical procedure for estimating the parameters of the local degradation model from a sample of real degraded documents is then discussed. The estimation procedure allows researchers to generate large data sets from small samples of real data. Such procedures for estimating parameters do not exist for other document degradation models. In fact, our approach can be easily adapted to estimate the parameters of other models as well. \nFinally, a statistical methodology that can be used to validate the local degradation models is described. This method is based on a non-parametric, two-sample permutation test. A variant of the method allows approximate validation tests instead. Another standard statistical device--the power function--is then used to choose between algorithm variables such as distance functions. Since the validation and power function procedures are independent of the model, they can be used to validate any other degradation model. A method for comparing any two models is also described. It uses p-values associated with the estimated models to select the model that is closer to the real world."

Accurate arc segmentation, essential for high-level engineering drawing understanding, is very difficult due to noise, clutter, tangency, and intersections with other geometry objects. We present an application of a generic methodology for recognition of multicomponent graphic objects in engineering drawings to the segmentation of circular arcs. The underlying mechanism is a sequential stepwise recovery of components that are segmented as wire fragments during the sparse-pixel vectorization process and meet a set of continuity conditions. Proper threshold selection and consistent checking of co-circularity of the assumed arc pieces result in an accurate arc segmentation method. Experimental results are presented, evaluated by an objective protocol, and discussed."

Perspective distortion is modeled by studying the underlying perspective geometry of the optical system of photocopiers and scanners. An illumination model is described to account for the nonlinear intensity change occurring across a page in a perspective\u2010distorted document. The optical distortion process is modeled morphologically. First, a distance transform on the foreground is performed; this is followed by a random inversion of binary pixels in which the probability of flip is a function of the distance of the pixel to the boundary of the foreground. Correlating the flipped pixels is modeled by a morphological closing operation.\u00a91994 John Wiley & Sons Inc"

This is contrary to conventional object-oriented approaches, that use different tools to describe the structure and the behaviour of the system. The underlying observation of the OPA paradigm is that every thing in the universe of interest is either an object or a process, and that a process is not necessarily a method of a single object class. This opens the door for the possibility of modelling systems so that both their structural and procedural relations are represented within the same frame of reference, without suppressing each other. The two major differences between OPA and OOA are OPA's detachment of processes from objects and its recursive scaling capability. The OPA methodology has proven to model faithfully complex systems, such as computer integrated manufacturing, documentation and inspection and an intelligent computer-assisted instruction shell. This work lays down the foundations of OPA. It provides concise definitions of the basic building blocks of the method: objects, processes, classes, features, and the structural and procedural relations among them. The object-process diagram (OPD) is presented as an effective visualization tool that incorporates elements from both DFD and OOA. Due to synergy, both the information content and expressive power of OPD are greater than those of DFD and OOA diagrams combined."
