In particular, we model the semantic composition of pairs of adjacent English Adjectives and Nouns from the British National Corpus. We build a vector-based semantic space from a lemmatised version of the BNC, where the most frequent A-N lemma pairs are treated as single tokens. We then extrapolate three different models of compositionality: a simple additive model, a pointwise-multiplicative model and a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model. We propose two evaluation methods for the implemented models. Our study leads to the conclusion that regression-based models of compositionality generally out-perform additive and multiplicative approaches, and also show a number of advantages that make them very promising for future research."

Possible applications of this method for language processing are described.

A key observation is that the monoidal category of (finite dimensional) vector spaces, linear maps and the tensor product, as well as any pregroup, are examples of compact closed categories. Since, by definition, a pregroup is a compact closed category with trivial morphisms, its compositional content is reflected within the compositional structure of any non-degenerate compact closed category. The (slightly refined) category of vector spaces enables us to compute the meaning of a compound well-typed sentence from the meaning of its constituents, by \u2018lifting\u2019 the type reduction mechanisms of pregroup semantics to the whole category. These sentence meanings live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence we can use the inner-product to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences. A variation of this procedure which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in the well-known Montague semantics."

Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors."

A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task."

                "text": "Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incorporated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval,"

By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts.

Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources.

This learning problem might be solved by using distributional cues to word boundaries \u2014 for example, by computing the transitional probabilities between sounds in the language input and using the relative strengths of these probabilities to hypothesize word boundaries. The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance. These results suggest that distributional cues may play an important role in the initial word segmentation of language learners. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc."

The device thus requires a memory only one symbol long. In addition, it must retain the uncancelled residue of the sentence after each scan, in order to cycle through it on the next scan; and storage is also needed for the various string-representations which a given sentence can have."

Ist sie eine Beziehung? eine Beziehung zwischen Gegenstanden? oder zwischen Namen oder Zeichen fur Gegenstande? Das letzte hatte ich in meiner Begriffsschrift angenommen. Die Grunde, die dafur zu sprechen scheinen, sind folgende: a=a und a=b sind offenbar Satze von verschiedenem Erkenntniswerte: a=a gilt a priori und ist nach Kant analytisch zu nennen, wahrend Satze von der Form a=b oft sehr wertvolle Erweiterungen unserer Erkenntnis enthalten und a priori nicht immer zu begrunden sind. Die Entdeckung, das nicht jeden Morgen eine neue Sonne aufgeht, sondern immer dieselbe, ist wohl eine der folgenreichsten in der Astronomie gewesen. Noch jetzt ist die Wiedererkennung eines kleinen Planeten oder eines Kometen\nnicht immer etwas Selbstverstandliches."
