Perhaps these maps represent an early stae in the analysis of visual information by the brain. Electrophysiological studies have shown that depth is analysed in V2 (area 18)(ref. 1), that colour-coded cells occur mainly in V4 and that motion in the visual field is analysed in the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus2 (Fig. 1). We report here an experiment which suggests that colour and movement are handled separately in the visual system and that information defined by wavelength cannot be processed by the brain's motion-detecting mechanisms. This finding is consistent with Zeki's demonstration that \u201ccells of the movement area are not concerned with colour\u201d2,3."

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask\u2019s central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2\u00bd-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum\u2019s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, co-operativity is necessary for the matching process."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

This description can account for fixation, tracking and some instances of spontaneous pattern preference behaviour. The phenomenological theory outlines the basic logical organization of the visual control system of the fly. It requires the neural network between the receptors and the flight muscles to perform two main computations on the visual input. One computation extracts movement information (the term r (\u03c8)\u03c8 b of the phenomenological equation). The other provides position information (the term D (\u03c8))."

These motion-in-depth channels include some that are selectively sensitive to the relative velocities of the left and right retinal images. We propose that the visual pathway contains stereoscopic (cyclopean) motion filters that respond to only a narrow range of the directions of motion in depth. Turning to the single-neuron level we report that, in addition to neurons tuned to position in depth, cat visual cortex contains neurons that emphasize information about the direction of motion at the expense of positional information. We describe psychophysical evidence for the existence of channels that are sensitive to changing size, and are separate from the channels both for motion and for flicker. These changing-size channels respond independently of whether the stimulus is a bright square on a dark ground or a dark square on a bright ground. At the physiological level we report single neurons in cat visual cortex that respond selectively to increasing or to decreasing size independently of the sign of stimulus contrast. Adaptation to a changing-size stimulus produces two separable after-effects: an illusion of changing size, and an illusion of motion in depth. These after-effects have different decay time constants. We propose a psychophysical model in which changing-size filters feed a motion-in-depth stage, and suppose that the motion-in-depth after-effect is due to activity at the motion-in-depth stage, while the changing-size after-effect is due to activity at the changing-size and more peripheral stages. The motion-in-depth after-effect can be cancelled either by a changing-size test stimulus or by relative motion of the left and right retinal images. Opposition of these two cues can also cancel the impression of motion in depth produced by the adapting stimulus. These findings link the stereoscopic (cyclopean) motion filters and the changing-size filters : both feed the same motion-in-depth stage."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

                "text": "Motion parallax is the optical change of the visual field of an observer which results from a change of his viewing position. It is often denned as the set of \"apparent motions\" of stationary objects which arise during locomotion. Psychologists assert that it is a \"cue\" for perceiving the depth of the objects, but the optical fact of motion parallax must be distinguished from its capacity to induce perceptions. It has not been experimentally demonstrated that motions in the field of view will actually yield corresponding judgments of depth. This is a purely psychological problem. The optics of motion parallax, on the other hand, is a problem for geometry and ecology. Recently, the suggestion has been made that a continuous gradient of motions in the field of view will induce the perception of slant-depth (J. J. Gibson, Olum, \u2022& Rosenblatt, 1955) inasmuch as the perception of depth is intimately connected with the perception of surfaces (J. J. Gibson, ^950). This statement also needs experimental test. The purpose of the present study is to investigate what kinds of motion in the light entering an eye do in fact consistently arouse certain judgments of depth, and what do not. The experiments must be carried out with artificial motions in a field of view rather than those obtained 1 This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research under Contract NONR 401 (14) with Cornell University.

Government. in a natural environment if we wish to study the effect of motion parallax in isolation from other cues or stimuli for depth. The variables of size, density, linear perspective, differential blur, and binocular parallax should be eliminated or so reduced as to be ineffective in the array of light entering O's eye. A method of achieving this result has been devised, and a suitable control employed. The experimental method should also preclude actual movement or locomotion of 0. If the cue of motion parallax is so defined as to require active head movement or locomotion, proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation is also present. This definition is unjustified, since passive locomotion in trains and airplanes should be admitted as circumstances when motion parallax occurs. Certain patterns of motion in the field of view of 0 do induce impressions of being moved through space if we accept as evidence the illusions of locomotion obtained in viewing a panoramic motion picture, or in a training device for simulating aerial flight."

Spatial frequency contrast sensitivity functions for the fundamental and second harmonic responses of Y cells to alternating phase gratings were determined. 3. The fundamental spatial frequency response was predicted by the Fourier transform of the sensitivity profile of the Y cell. The high spatial frequency cut\u2010off of a Y cell's fundamental response was in this way related to the centre of the cell's receptive field. 4. The second harmonic response of a Y cell did not cut off at such a low spatial frequency as the fundamental response. This result indicated that the source of the second harmonic was a spatial subunit of the receptive field smaller in spatial extent than the centre. 5. Contrast sensitivity vs. spatial phase for a Y cell was measured under three conditions: a full grating, a grating seen through a centrally located window, a grating partially obscured by a visual shutter. The 2nd/1st harmonic sensitivity ratio went down with the window and up with the shutter. These results implied that the centre of Y cells was linear and also that the nonlinear subunits extended into the receptive field surround. 6. Spatial localization of the nonlinear subunits was determined by means of a spatial dipole stimulus. The nonlinear subunits overlapped the centre and surround of the receptive field and extended beyond both. 7. The nature of the Y cell nonlinearity was found to be rectification, as determined from measurements of the second harmonic response as a function of contrast. 8. Spatial models for the Y cell receptive field are proposed."

                "text": "1. Responses to stimulation of retinal regions remote from the classical receptive field were recorded from optic tract fibres in lightly anaesthetized cats. 2. X\u2010 and Y\u2010cells gave reliably different responses to the sudden reversal of the phase of a high contrast grating that fell on the retina more than 15 deg from the centre of the receptive field. 3. The mechanism that generates these responses ('shift effect' or 'periphery effect') in Y\u2010cells is insensitive to the spatial phase of the stimulating grating. It can resolve gratings of higher spatial frequency than can be resolved by the classical receptive field mechanisms of Y\u2010cells but its temporal resolution is poorer. 4. Signals that contribute to peripherally evoked responses are accumulated over a region that extends to at least 35 deg from the centre of the receptive field. Although this region is not uniformly sensitive, regions in the periphery of the visual field are as effective as regions around the area centralis in eliciting the responses, and do not require coarser gratings. 5. In some Y\u2010cells the response to peripheral stimulation was amplified by increasing (on\u2010centre units) or decreasing (off\u2010centre units) the steady illumination of the centre of the receptive field. This confirms Kr\u00fcger & Fisher (1973), but the effect is only found in a proportion of cells. 6. The mechanism that generates peripherally evoked responses is tentatively identified with the 'rectifying subunits' postulated by Hochstein & Shapley (1976b) to account for the spatial non\u2010linearity in the receptive fields of Y\u2010cells. Transient (bistratified) amacrine cells are known to have many of the properties attributed to these mechanisms (Chan & Naka, 1976)."

Receptive fields of these units were mapped out, in the light-adapted state, with small sports of light. In their general arrangement geniculate receptive fields resembled those of retinal ganglion cells, having an excitatory ('on') centre and inhibitory ('off') preriphery, or reverse. The two portions of a receptive field were mutually antagonistic; the decrease in centre responses cauded by inclusion of peripheral portions of receptive fields was termed peripheral suppression. Cells recorded in layers A and B of the lateral geniculate body were driven from the contralateral eye; cells in layer A1 from the ipsilateral eye. In penetrations normal to the layers receptive fields of cells in a single layer were close together or superimposed, and from one layer to the next occupied exactly homologous positions in the two retinas. Binocular interaction was not observed in any of the cells studied. All three layers of the lateral geniculate contained both 'on'-centre and 'off'-centre units. Cells in layers A and A1 were similar both in their firing patterns and in average receptive field size. Cells in layer B were more sluggish in their responses to light stimuli, and tended to have larger receptive field centres. Cells with receptive fields within or near the area centralis tended to have smaller field centres and stronger suppression by the receptive field periphery than cells with their fields situated in more peripheral regions of the retina."

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

Common properties were found in the dimension of the smallest stimulus displacement giving a direction-selective response and in the role of inhibition in suppressing the response as the stimulus moved in the nonpreferred direction. However, the effectiveness of this inhibition varied in the two cell types since it suppressed both driven and spontaneous activity in the simple cell, but only driven firing in the complex cell. It is argued that direction selectivity must enter the response before the complex cell if the inhibition responsible for it's generation fails to influence the spontaneous activity of the cell. The consequences of this finding are considered in the terms of parallel or sequential processing of visual information in striate cortex."

First, relay cells of the LGNd have either onor off-center receptive fields (16), because each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either onor off-center retinal ganglion cells (6, 16). Second, retinal ganglion cells fall into two groups (X-cells and Y-cells) according to whether they sum the influences of the center and surround regions of their receptive fields linearly or nonlinearly (8). Most LGNd relay cells can be similarly classified because most receive direct excitatory drive from either Xor Y-type retinal ganglion cells (6). Third, each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either fastor slow-conducting retinal afferents, and its own axon is correspondingly either fast or slow conducting (6, 36). The two latter parameters are closely correlated since Y-cells have been shown to have fast axons and Xcells, slow axons (6, 11). The on/off organization is independent of the other two parameters, however. Roth Y-cells and Xcells can have either onor off-center fields. This report examines several features of the LGNd relay in the normal cat, extending previous concepts and establishing a spectrum of normal properties against which the properties of the LGNd in deprived cats (described in the following paper (3W can be compared. First, the separate relay in the LGNd of the Xand Y-cell activity of the retina is described. Second, several properties of Xand Y-cells of the LGNd were observed to vary con-"

Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating. 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on\u2010off' response, or frequency doubling, at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase, while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7. The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity. X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells. The nonlinearity index was most reliable because it was least dependent on retinal eccentricity."

The smallest stimulus displacement for which a direction-selective discrimination can be made cannot be smaller than the threshold for the detection of the displacement itself. It is shown that retinal image quality is an important limiting factor in respect to the thresholds both for stimulus displacement and direction selectivity."

Action potentials were recorded from optic nerve fibres of lightly anaesthetized cats while parts of the retina remote from the receptive field were stimulated by a shifting grating. 2. Vigorous responses can be obtained under these conditions, confirming McIlwain (1966), Kr\u00fcger & Fischer (1973), and others. 3. These 'shift responses' are not caused by fluctuations of stray light because (a) they cannot be reduced by deliberately increasing or decreasing the light falling on the receptive field synchronously with the shifting grating; (b) a steady adapting light applied to the receptive field does not raise the threshold for the responses, whereas adapting light on the peripheral retina does, and (c) the threshold for the responses is elevated more following bleaching adaptation of the periphery than following bleaching adaptation of the centre. 4. Shift responses are strong, of short latency, and brief in duration in brisk\u2010transient (Y\u2010type) neurones. With few exceptions they are weak but long\u2010lasting in brisk\u2010sustained (X\u2010type) neurones. 5. Shift responses are unlike responses from the main receptive field in having a distinct threshold; the magnitude of the response to weak gratings is not simply proportional to contrast, as is the case with weak stimuli applied to the receptive field. 6. It is thought that the excitatory pathway may involve amacrine cells, and that this mechanism may be concerned with the detection of the shifts of the image that occur with saccadic eye movements."

                "text": "1. The iontophoretic application of the GABA antagonist bicuculline to simple and complex cells in the striate cortex of the cat produced extensive modifications of receptive field properties. These modifications appear to relate to a block or reduction of GABA\u2010mediated intracortical inhibitory influences acting on the cells examined. 2. For simple cells the effects of bicuculline on receptive field properties involved a loss of the subdivision of the receptive field into antagonistic \"on\" and \"off\" regions, a reduction in orientation specificity and a reduction or elimination of directional specificity. 3. The effect on the \"on\" and \"off\" subdivisions of the simple cell receptive field was such that all stationary flashing stimuli, whether covering the whole receptive field, or located within the receptive field over a previously determined \"on\" or \"off\" region, resulted in an \"on and off\" response. 4. The orientation specificity of complex cells was reduced during the application of bicuculline such that in many cases the original specificity of the cell was virtually lost with the response to the orientation at 90 degrees to the optimal being of similar magnitude to the optimal. The directional specificity of complex cells was generally less affected than that of simple cells. Often when large changes in orientation specificity were observed the directional specificity was relatively unaffected. 5. For some cells apparently showing to all visual stimuli only inhibitory responses, the application of bicuculline resulted in the appearance of excitatory responses. 6. In all cases receptive field properties reverted to the original state after termination of the bicuculline application. It was not generally possible to duplicate the effects of bicuculline by raising neuronal excitability with iontophoretically applied glutamate. 7. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the normal subdivision of the simple cell receptive field into separate \"on\" and \"off\" regions and its directional specificity are dependent on intracortical inhibitory processes that are blocked by bicuculline. The orientational tuning of simple cells conversely appears to be largely determined by the excitatory input but normally enhanced by lateral type inhibitory processes acting in the orientation domain. 8. It also appears that the excitatory input to some complex cells is not orientation specific. This suggests that for these cells it is extremely unlikely that they receive an orientation specific excitatory input from simple cells."

CX-type cells became more broadly tuned in the deeper cortical layers: S-type cells were equally well tuned throughout the cortex. 3. Sharpness of orientation selectivity for S-type cells was similar at all retinal eccentricities studied (0 degrees - 20 degrees from the fovea):in CX-type cells orientation selectivity decreased slightly with increasing eccentricity. 4. The orientation tuning of binocular cells was similar when mapped separately through each eye. 5. Orientation selectivity and direction selectivity are independent of each other, suggesting that separate neural mechanisms give rise to them. 6. More CX-type cells can be binocularly activated than S-type cells (88% versus 49%). The ocular dominance of S-type cells is similar in all cortical layers: for CX-type cells there is an increase in the number of cells in ocular-dominance category 4 in layers 5 and 6."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

Much is known about the impressive effectiveness of binocular disparity. However, the excellent perception of threedimensional form in monocular vision has remained essentially unexplained. It has been proposed that some patterns of stimulation on the retina give rise to three-dimensional experiences, because visual processes differ in the spontaneous organization that results from certain properties of the retinal pattern. Rules of organization are supposed to exist according to which most retinal projections of three-dimensional forms happen to produce three-dimensional percepts and most retinal images of flat forms lead to flat forms in experience also. This view has been held mainly by gestalt psychologists. Another approach to this problem maintains that the projected stimulus patterns are interpreted on the basis of previous experience, either visual"

The moving of cells studied were not selective for bar width or for the spatial frequency of square-wave gratings. 3. Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

The question addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motion of objects can be inferred from the two dimensional transformations of their projected images when no three dimensional information is conveyed by the individual projections. The following scheme is proposed: (i) divide the image into groups of four elements each; (ii) test each group for a rigid interpretation; (iii) combine the results obtained in (ii). It is shown that this scheme will correctly decompose scenes containing arbitrary rigid objects in motion, recovering their three dimensional structure and motion. The analysis is based primarily on the \u02bbstructure from motion\u2019 theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed."

Phi movement between two granular patterns, one being the photographic negative of the other, appeared to be rater&, towards the direction of the earlier stimulus. Moving objects, displayed on a TV picture which was made positive and negative on alternate frames, appeared to move backwards. (The backward movement could generate its own after effect of movement.) Conclusion: phi movement was perceived between nearby points of similar brightness, itrespective of form or colour. Phi movement was studied between two positive random-dot Julesz patterns. Pairs that gave stereo when presented dichoptically also gave phi movement when presented alternatively to one eye. When one pattern was degraded with noise, both stereo and phi broke down at the same noise level. Conclusion: phi, like stereo, depended upon point-by-point comparison of brightness between two patterns. It could precede the perception of form. RbunA-QueUe ressemblance doit-il etister entre deux figures present&s successivement pour que l\u2019on perceive un mouvement phi entre etles? Entre dew figures granulaires dont l\u2019une est Ie negatif photographique de I\u2019autre, le mouvement phi apparalt inversi, dans la direction du premier stimulus. Des objets mobiles, vus en TV de facon que Ies images soient ahemativement positives et negatives, semblent se d&placer a l\u2019envers. (Ce mouvement a I\u2019envers peut engendrer son propre effet consecutif de mouvement.) On conclut que le mouvement phi est percu entre des points voisins de luminositi semblable, ind6pendamment de la forme et de la couleur. On itudie le mouvement phi entre deux figures de Julesz composees de points positifs au hasard. Lea paires qui donnent l\u2019effet stereo quand on les pr&eate chacune a un oeil, donnent aussi le mouvement phi quand on lea p&sente altemativement au m&me oeil. Quand on degrade tme figure par du bruit, la stereo et le mouvement phi disparaissent au mt?me. niveau de bruit. On en d&it que le mouvcment phi, comme la sttrCo, depend dune comparaison point par point de luminositt entre deux figures; elte peut p&&r la perception de la forme. Zmammenfassung-Wie weit miissen zwei emander folgend Muster emander iihneln, um die B-Rewegung hervorzurufen? Die B-Bewegung zwischen zwei k&n&en Mustem, deren eines das photograph&he Negativ des andem war, schien umgekehrt zu sein, d.h. sich in der Richtung des frbheren Reizes zu bewegen. Bewegungsgegenstshde, welche auf einem Femsehschirm abwechselnd positiv und negativ dargestellt wrtrcn, schinen sich zurfkkzubewegen. (Die Rtickbewegung konnteihreneigenen Nacheffekt erzeugen.) Folgerung: die B-Bewegung war zwischen benachbarten Put&ten ghnlicher Hell@& ohne Rticksicht auf Form oder Earbe zu sehen. Die kBewegung wurde zwischen zwei poritiven Juleszschen Zufallspunktmustem untersucht. Die Paare, welche bei&ugig das Tiefensehen erlaubten, etzeugten such die B-Bewegung, wenn wechselnd jedem der biden Augen dargeboten.

The iontophoretic application of the alkaloid bicuculline to neurones in area 17 of the cat's visual cortex effectively antagonized the inhibitory action of iontophoretically applied GABA in fifty\u2010four out of sixty\u2010two neurones examined. It had little or no effect on the inhibitory action of iontophoretically applied glycine. 2. At the stage that the iontophoretic application of bicuculline blocked the inhibitory action of GABA it also reduced or blocked visually evoked inhibitory influences acting on forty\u2010three of the fifty\u2010four cells. This effect on visually evoked inhibition was not reproduced by simply raising the neural spontaneous activity with iontophoretically applied glutamate. 3. For those seven neurones where the iontophoresis of bicuculline failed to block the inhibitory action of iontophoretically applied GABA it also failed to produce any change in visually evoked inhibition. 4. In all cases where a visually evoked inhibition of a cells resting discharge was reduced by the iontophoretic application of bicuculline, the inhibitory response was replaced by an excitatory response. The application of bicuculline also revealed excitatory responses to certain of the visual stimuli that previously appeared to exert neither inhibitory nor excitatory effects on a cell, and often where cells normally exhibited small excitatory responses it produced large increases in the magnitude of the evoked response. 5. These results indicate that the normal responses of the neurones examined in the present work, to the particular visual stimuli used, reflect an interaction between simultaneously evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs. It is suggested that the iontophoretic application of bicuculline by blocking or reducing the inhibitory input moves the balance between the inputs in favour of the excitatory input. 6. The present results support the view that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in the visual cortex."

If studied empirically, the directionally selective unit that we describe in figure 2c would be classified by Schiller et al. 1976a as an SI cell, responding to a single contrast edge moving in one direction. The size of its sensitive region would be of the order of w for an X cell, about 15' at 4? eccentricity in the monkey, which is in rough agreement with the findings of Schiller et al. More complex units, like their S2 unit (a directionally selective 'bar' detector), can be built up in similar ways (e.g. X + Y X- Y-X + would detect a dark bar moving to the right). According to our earlier calculations, our proposed unit would be reliable for velocities up to at least 3?/s, being limited at the lower end only by the sensitivity of the Y channel. The most sensible design for the Y channel is therefore to make it as sensitive as possible to small values of a(V2G*I)/at, the price of sensitivity being poor resolution in speed. Consequently, one would expect the Y channel to saturate early (as well as earlier for higher contrasts), giving a flat response curve for a given contrast as a function of velocity. Goodwin et al. (1975, tbl. 1) report velocity sensitivities down to 0.18?/s. in the cat, and psychophysical data (King-Smith et al. 1978) show that humans are sensitive down to about 1'/s. Both these articles support our ideas about the flatness of the velocity sensitivity curve. Our proposed unit will respond not only to continuous movement but also to discrete jumps. The response of simple cells to small jumps led Pettigrew et al. (I968) to suggest that the overall unit is assembled from smaller directionally selective subunits. This would not be necessary for the unit that we are proposing. Because it is a single unit and not a composite of two adjacent detectors connected, for example, through some kind of delay, it will respond to any jump that is small enough and fast enough. The size of the jump must be such that both the initial and final positions lie between the centres of the X+ and X- receptive fields; and the interval between presentations of the initial and final cells cannot much exceed 60 ms, because of the temporal characteristics of the Y channel. Goodwin & Henry (1975) found in the cat that a jump of 0."
