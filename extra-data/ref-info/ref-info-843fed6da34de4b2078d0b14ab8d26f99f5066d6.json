A recent paper [1] describes a number of techniques to find maximal complete subgraphs of a given undirected graph. In this paper, we present two backtracking algorithms, using a branchand-bound technique [4] to cut off branches that cannot lead to a clique. The first version is a straightforward implementation of the basic algorithm. It is mainly presented to illustrate the method used. This version generates cliques in alphabetic (lexicographic) order. The second version is derived from the first and generates cliques in a rather unpredictable order in an attempt to minimize the number of branches to be traversed. This version tends to produce the larger cliques first and to generate sequentially cliques having a large common intersection. The detailed algorithm for version 2 is presented here. Description o f the algorithm--Version 1. Three sets play an important role in the algorithm. (1) The set compsub is the set to be extended by a new point or shrunk by one point on traveling along a branch of the backtracking tree. The points that are eligible to extend compsub, i.e. that are connected to all points in compsub, are collected recursively in the remaining two sets. (2) The set candidates is the set of all points that will in due time serve as an extension to the present configuration of compsub. (3) The set not is the set of all points that have at an earlier stage already served as an extension of the present configuration of compsub and are now explicitly excluded. The reason for maintaining this set trot will soon be made clear. The core of the algorithm consists of a recursively defined extension operator that will be applied to the three sets Just described. It has the duty to generate all extensions of the given configuration of compsub that it can make with the given set of candidates and that do not contain any of the points in not. To put it differently: all extensions of compsub containing any point in not have already been generated. The basic mechanism now consists of the following five steps:"

Here \u201creduced\u201d means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed."

During the procedure, from any given graph two graphs, the representative graph and the reordered graph, are derived. The representative graph is a homomorphic image of the original graph; the reordered graph is constructed from the representative graph to be isomorphic to the given graph. Unique labels are assigned to the vertices of both derived graphs. It follows that two repre- sentative graphs or two reordered graphs are isomorphic if and only if they are identical. A conjecture states that the representative graphs exhibit the automorphism partitioning of the given graph. The representative graphs form a necessity condition for isomorphism; namely, if the representative graphs are not identical, then the given graphs are not isomorphic. The converse is true for trees and follows from the conjecture for other types of graphs. It is also shown that the reordered graphs form a sufficiency condition for isomorphism; namely, if the reordered graphs are identical, then the given graphs are isomorphic. The converse follows from the conjecture. The time required to determine both derived graphs depends on a power of n, the order of the given graph. This power is a function of an adjacency property known as the strong regu- larity of the given graph. For graphs that do not contain a strongly regular transitive sub- graph, the power is, at worst, five."
