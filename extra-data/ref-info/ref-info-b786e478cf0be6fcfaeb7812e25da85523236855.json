When computing space-time descriptors, however, the result may strongly depend on the relative motion between the object and the camera. To compensate for this variation, we present a method that automatically adapts the features to the local velocity of the image pattern and, hence, results in a video representation that is stable with respect to different amounts of camera motion. Experimentally we show that the use of velocity adaptation substantially increases the repeatability of interest points as well as the stability of their associated descriptors. Moreover, for an application to human action recognition we demonstrate how velocity-adapted features enable recognition of human actions in situations with unknown camera motion and complex, non-stationary backgrounds."

Joint statistics of space-time filters are employed to define histograms which characterize the activities to be recognized. These histograms provide the joint probability density functions required for recognition using Bayes rule. The result is a technique for recognition of activities which is robust to partial occlusions as well as changes in illumination. In this paper the framework and background for this approach is first described. Then the family of spatio-temporal receptive fields used for characterizing activities is presented. This is followed by a review of probabilistic recognition of patterns from joint statistics of receptive field responses. The approach is validated with the results of experiments in the discrimination of persons walking in different directions, and the recognition of a simple set of hand gestures in an augmented reality scenario."

We introduce a novel motion descriptor based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two forms of data-based action synthesis \"do as I do\" and \"do as I say\". Results are demonstrated on ballet, tennis as well as football datasets."

We propose to extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for its interpretation. To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points. For the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how the proposed method allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic backgrounds."

The basis of the representation is a temporal template | a static vector-image where the vector value at each point is a function of the motion properties at the corresponding spatial location in an image sequence. Using 18 aerobics exercises as a test domain, we explore the representational power of a simple, two component version of the templates: the rst value is a binary value indicating the presence of motion, and the second value is a function of the recency of motion in a sequence. We then develop a recognition method which matches these temporal templates against stored instances of views of known actions. The method automatically performs temporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real-time on a standard platform. We recently incorporated this technique into the KidsRoom: an interactive, narrative play-space for children."

The basis of the representation is a temporal template-a static vector-image where the vector value at each point is a function of the motion properties at the corresponding spatial location in an image sequence. Using 18 aerobics exercises as a test domain, we explore the representational power of a simple, two component version of the templates: the first value is a binary value indicating the presence of motion, and the second value is a function of the recency of motion in a sequence. We then develop a recognition method which matches these temporal templates against stored instances of views of known actions. The method automatically performs temporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real-time on a standard platform. We recently incorporated this technique into the KIDSROOM: an interactive, narrative play-space for children."

Support vector machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

Based on this, we design a simple statistical distance measure between video sequences (possibly of different lengths) based on their behavioral content. This measure is non-parametric and can thus handle a wide range of dynamic events. We use this measure for isolating and clustering events within long continuous video sequences. This is done without prior knowledge of the types of events, their models, or their temporal extent. An outcome of such a clustering process is a temporal segmentation of long video sequences into event-consistent sub-sequences, and their grouping into event-consistent clusters. Our event representation and associated distance measure can also be used for event-based indexing into long video sequences, even when only one short example-clip is available. However, when multiple example-clips of the same event are available (either as a result of the clustering process, or given manually), these can be used to refine the event representation, the associated distance measure, and accordingly the quality of the detection and clustering process."

This interest is motivated by a wide spectrum of applications, such as athletic performance analysis, surveillance, man-machine interfaces, content-based image storage and retrieval, and video conferencing. The paper gives an overview of the various tasks involved in motion analysis of the human body. The authors focus on three major areas related to interpreting human motion: 1) motion analysis involving human body parts, 2) tracking of human motion using single or multiple cameras, and 3) recognizing human activities from image sequences. Motion analysis of human body parts involves the low-level segmentation of the human body into segments connected by joints, and recovers the 3D structure of the human body using its 2D projections over a sequence of images. Tracking human motion using a single or multiple camera focuses on higher-level processing, in which moving humans are tracked without identifying specific parts of the body structure. After successfully matching the moving human image from one frame to another in image sequences, understanding the human movements or activities comes naturally, which leads to a discussion of recognizing human activities. The review is illustrated by examples."

Each process is discussed and divided into subprocesses and/or categories of methods to provide a reference to describe and compare the more than 130 publications covered by the survey. References are included throughout the paper to exemplify important issues and their relations to the various methods. A number of general assumptions used in this research field are identified and the character of these assumptions indicates that the research field is still in an early stage of development. To evaluate the state of the art, the major application areas are identified and performances are analyzed in light of the methods presented in the survey. Finally, suggestions for future research directions are offered."

The approach builds on and extends work on eigenspace representations, robust estimation techniques, and parameterized optical flow estimation. First, we note that the least-squares image reconstruction of standard eigenspace techniques has a number of problems and we reformulate the reconstruction problem as one of robust estimation. Second we define a \u201csubspace constancy assumption\u201d that allows us to exploit techniques for parameterized optical flow estimation to simultaneously solve for the view of an object and the affine transformation between the eigenspace and the image. To account for large affine transformations between the eigenspace and the image we define a multi-scale eigenspace representation and a coarse-to-fine matching strategy. Finally, we use these techniques to track objects over long image sequences in which the objects simultaneously undergo both affine image motions and changes of view. In particular we use this \u201cEigenTracking\u201d technique to track and recognize the gestures of a moving hand."

As presented, their method is restricted to the case where W, the weighted adjacency matrix, is positive definite. Although many common measures of image similarity (i.e. kernels) are positive definite, a popular example being Gaussian-weighted distance, there are important cases that are not. In this work, we present a modification to Nystrom-NCut that does not require W to be positive definite. The modification only affects the orthogonalization step, and in doing so it necessitates one additional O(m3) operation, where m is the number of random samples used in the approximation. As such it is of interest to know which kernels are positive definite and which are indefinite. In addressing this issue, we further develop connections between NCut and related methods in the kernel machines literature. We provide a proof that the Gaussian-weighted chi-squared kernel is positive definite, which has thus far only been conjectured. We also explore the performance of the approximation algorithm on a variety of grouping cues including contour, color and texture."
