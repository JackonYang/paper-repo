We show how MDL can be used to develop highly redundant population codes. Each hidden unit has a location in a low-dimensional implicit space. If the hidden unit activities form a bump of a standard shape in this space, they can be cheaply encoded by the center ofthis bump. So the weights from the input units to the hidden units in an autoencoder are trained to make the activities form a standard bump. The coordinates of the hidden units in the implicit space are also learned, thus allowing flexibility, as the network develops a discontinuous topography when presented with different input classes. Population-coding in a space other than the input enables a network to extract nonlinear higher-order properties of the inputs. Most existing unsupervised learning algorithms can be understood using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1989). Given an ensemble of input vectors, the aim of the learning algorithm is to find a method of coding each input vector that minimizes the total cost, in bits, of communicating the input vectors to a receiver. There are three terms in the total description length: \u2022 The code-cost is the number of bits required to communicate the code that the algorithm assigns to each input vector."

The primary goal of an unsupervised learning procedure is to optimize the quality of a system's internal representation. In this thesis, we present a general framework for describing unsupervised learning procedures based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle states that the best model is one that minimizes the summed description length of the model and the data with respect to the model. Applying this approach to the unsupervised learning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracy of a representation (i.e., how concise a description of the input may be generated from it) and its succinctness (i.e., how compactly the representation itself can be described). \nViewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of the framework exposes their implicit assumptions about the type of structure assumed to underlie the data. While these existing algorithms typically minimize the data description using a fixed length representation, we use the framework to derive a class of objective functions for training self-supervised neural networks, where the goal is to minimize the description length of the representation simultaneously with that of the data. Formulating a description of the representation forces assumptions about the structure of the data to be made explicit, which in turn leads to a particular network configuration as well as an objective function that can be used to optimize the network parameters. We describe three new learning algorithms derived in this manner from the MDL framework. Each algorithm embodies a different scheme for describing the internal representation, and is therefore suited to a range of datasets based on the structure underlying the data. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms on some simple computational vision tasks."

By employing mean field theory, the stochastic settling to thermal equilibrium can be replaced by efficient deterministic settling to a steady state. The analogous deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learning rule performs steepest descent in an appropriately defined error measure under certain circumstances and has been empirically shown to solve a variety of non-trivial supervised, input-output problems.However, by applying \u2018naive\u2019 mean field theory to a finite system with non-random interactions, the true stochastic system is not well described, and representational problems result that significantly limit the situations in which the DBM procedure can be successfully applied. It is shown that the independence assumption is unacceptably ..."
