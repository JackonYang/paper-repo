We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

Most solutions proposed so far such as those based on color histograms and local texture statistics cannot capture a scene's global configuration, which is critical in perceptual judgments of scene similarity. We present a novel approach, \"configural recognition\", for encoding scene class structure. The approach's main feature is its use of qualitative spatial and photometric relationships within and across regions in low resolution images. The emphasis on qualitative measures leads to enhanced generalization abilities and the use of low-resolution images renders the scheme computationally efficient. We present results on a large database of natural scenes. We also describe how qualitative scene concepts may be learned from examples."

The algorithm extends the representational efficiency of eigenimage methods to binary features, which are less sensitive to illumination changes than gray-level values normally used with eigenimages. Binary features (square subtemplates) are automatically chosen on each training image. Using features rather than whole templates makes the algorithm more robust to background clutter and partial occlusions. Instead of representing the features with real-valued eigenvector principle components, we use binary vector quantization to avoid floating point computations. The object is detected in the image using a simple geometric hash table and Hough transform. On a test of 1000 images, the algorithm works on 99.3%. We present a theoretical analysis of the algorithm in terms of the receiver operating characteristic, which consists of the probabilities of detection and false alarm. We verify this analysis with the results of our 1000-image test and we use the analysis as a principled way to select some of the algorithm's important operating parameters."

We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

Dynamic programming ensures global optimality of the solution, is numerically stable, and allows for hard constraints to be enforced on the behavior of the solution within a natural and straightforward structure. As a specific example of the approach's efficacy, applying dynamic programming to the energy-minimizing active contours is described. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multistage decision process and is solved by a time-delayed discrete dynamic programming algorithm. A parallel procedure for decreasing computational costs is discussed. >"
