By using efficient, nearly arc-factored inference and a bidirectional-LSTM composed with a multi-layer perceptron, our base system is able to significantly improve the state of the art for semantic dependency parsing, without using hand-engineered features or syntax. We then explore two multitask learning approaches\u2014one that shares parameters across formalisms, and one that uses higher-order structures to predict the graphs jointly. We find that both approaches improve performance across formalisms on average, achieving a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and available at https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/NeurboParser."

It particularly features the structural property of multi-head, which allows nodes to have multiple heads, resulting in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) parsing problem. Yet most statistical parsers focused exclusively on shallow bi-lexical tree structures, DAG parsing remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a neural transition-based parser, using a variant of list-based arc-eager transition algorithm for dependency graph parsing. Particularly, two non-trivial improvements are proposed for representing the key components of the transition system, to better capture the semantics of segments and internal sub-graph structures. We test our parser on the SemEval-2016 Task 9 dataset (Chinese) and the SemEval-2015 Task 18 dataset (English). On both benchmark datasets, we obtain superior or comparable results to the best performing systems. Our parser can be further improved with a simple ensemble mechanism, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance."

However, strict surface-structure dependency trees tend to follow the linguistic structure of sentences too closely and frequently fail to provide direct relations between content words. To mitigate this problem, the original Stanford Dependencies representation also defines two dependency graph representations which contain additional and augmented relations that explicitly capture otherwise implicit relations between content words. In this paper, we revisit and extend these dependency graph representations in light of the recent Universal Dependencies (UD) initiative and provide a detailed account of an enhanced and an enhanced++ English UD representation. We further present a converter from constituency to basic, i.e., strict surface structure, UD trees, and a converter from basic UD trees to enhanced and enhanced++ English UD graphs. We release both converters as part of Stanford CoreNLP and the Stanford Parser."

Recent work shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic dependencies to logical forms. However, this work is limited to English, and cannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such as control. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a semantic interface for UD, which maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent fashion and can process dependency graphs. We perform experiments on question answering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation. Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets. For English, it achieves a 4.9 F1 point improvement over the state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions."

The purpose of this shared task was to evaluate dependency graphs on three downstream tasks. Through our submissions, we evaluated the usability of several representations derived from English Universal Dependencies (UD), as well as the Stanford Dependencies (SD), Predicate Argument Structure (PAS), and DM representations. We further compared two parsing strategies: Directly parsing to graph-based dependency representations and a two-stage process of first parsing to surface syntax trees and then applying rule-based augmentations to obtain the final graphs. Overall, our systems performed very well and our submissions ranked first and third. In our analysis, we find that the two-stage parsing process leads to better downstream performance, and that enhanced UD, a graph-based representation, consistently outperforms basic UD, a strict surface syntax representation, suggesting an advantage of enriched representations for downstream tasks."

We use a larger but more thoroughly regularized parser than other recent BiLSTM-based approaches, with biaffine classifiers to predict arcs and labels. Our parser gets state of the art or near state of the art performance on standard treebanks for six different languages, achieving 95.7% UAS and 94.1% LAS on the most popular English PTB dataset. This makes it the highest-performing graph-based parser on this benchmark---outperforming Kiperwasser Goldberg (2016) by 1.8% and 2.2%---and comparable to the highest performing transition-based parser (Kuncoro et al., 2016), which achieves 95.8% UAS and 94.6% LAS. We also show which hyperparameter choices had a significant effect on parsing accuracy, allowing us to achieve large gains over other graph-based approaches."

The next step would be to get more of syntactic analysis , and the \" enhanced dependencies \" sketched in the UD 2.0 guidelines is a promising attempt in that direction. In this work we propose to go further and enrich the enhanced dependency scheme along two axis: extending the cases of recovered arguments of non-finite verbs, and neutralizing syntactic alternations. Doing so leads to both richer and more uniform structures, while remaining at the syntactic level, and thus rather neutral with respect to the type of semantic representation that can be further obtained. We implemented this proposal in two UD treebanks of French, using deterministic graph-rewriting rules. Evaluation on a 200 sentence gold standard shows that deep syntactic graphs can be obtained from surface syntax annotations with a high accuracy. Among all arguments of verbs in the gold standard, 13.91% are impacted by syntactic alternation normalization, and 18.93% are additional deep edges."

Combining pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) with an internal stack, the proposed model first reads and encodes the whole sentence, then builds the dependency tree top-down (from root-to-leaf) in a depth-first fashion. The stack tracks the status of the depth-first search and the pointer networks select one child for the word at the top of the stack at each step. The StackPtr parser benefits from the information of whole sentence and all previously derived subtree structures, and removes the left-to-right restriction in classical transition-based parsers. Yet the number of steps for building any (non-projective) parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence just as other transition-based parsers, yielding an efficient decoding algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity. We evaluate our model on 29 treebanks spanning 20 languages and different dependency annotation schemas, and achieve state-of-the-art performances on 21 of them"

WCGL18 is Wang et al.\u2019s (2018) transition-based system. Table 1 compares our performance with these systems. Our fully factorized basic system already substantially outperforms Peng et al.\u2019s single-task baseline and also beats out their much more complex multi-task approach. Simply adding in either a character-level word embedding model (similar to Dozat et al.\u2019s (2017)) or a lemma embedding matrix likewise improves performance quite a bit, and including both together generally pushes performance even higher."

Our system is characterized by a feature-rich linear model, that includes scores for first and second-order dependencies (arcs, siblings, grandparents and co-parents). For decoding this second-order model, we solve a linear relaxation of that problem using alternating directions dual decomposition (AD 3 ). The experiments have shown that, even though the parser\u2019s performance in Chinese and Czech attains around 80% (not too far from English performance), domain shift is a serious issue, suggesting domain adaptation as an interesting avenue for future research."

In this paper, we describe v1 of the universal guidelines, the underlying design principles, and the currently available treebanks for 33 languages."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

This form of training, which accounts for model predictions at training time rather than assuming an error-free action history, improves parsing accuracies for both English and Chinese, obtaining very strong results for both languages. We discuss some modifications needed in order to get training with exploration to work well for a probabilistic neural-network."

Semantic annotations are produced by parsing with a broad-coverage precision grammar, followed by manual disambiguation. The selection of the preferred analysis for each item (and hence its semantic form) builds on a notion of semantic discriminants, essentially localized dependencies extracted from a full-fledged, underspecified semantic representation. 1. Background \u2014 Motivation Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 1999) has gained popularity in computational semantics for its balance of formal and computational properties. Much like similar approaches (Reyle, 1993, Bos, 1995, inter alia), MRS facilitates underspecification of common scope ambiguities by means of separating dominance relations and \u2018regular\u2019 argument binding. Based on a designated type of \u2018handle\u2019 variables plus dominance constraints on how these can be realized over an otherwise flat multi-set of semantic relations, scopal relations are effectively factored out from the \u2018gist\u2019 of the semantics. MRS is used as the meaning representation language in the Norwegian LOGON project, a research initiative aiming for high-quality machine translation of tourism texts (Oepen et al., 2004).1 LOGON pursues a relatively conventional approach to MT based on semantic transfer. A Norwegian sentence is analyzed into its MRS form. This semantic representation of the content of the Norwegian sentence is mapped into an MRS representations of the target language through semantic transfer, and subsequently realized using grammar-based generation for English. For analysis, an existing Norwegian parser (NorGram; Dyvik, 1999, Butt, Dyvik, King, Masuichi, & Rohrer, 2002) based on LFG and implemented in XLE was extended and equipped with an MRS projection (in the LFG co-description approach). For English generation, the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger, 2000) and DELPH-IN HPSG tools2 were applied. All interface terms among LOGON components are MRS formulae. Despite current streams of fashion of using purely satistical methods for MT, the LOGON approach assumes that long-term success in MT will require integration of symbolic and stochastic approaches. In addition to the rule-based semantic transfer architecture, LOGON applies statistical methods for selecting and ranking between alternatives both in its parsing and generation phases. See \u2018http://www.emmtee.net/\u2019 for background information on the LOGON initiative, including a comprehensive bibliography and access to the open-source core of the system. See \u2018http://www.delph-in.net/\u2019 for the DELPH-IN open-source repository of \u2018deep\u2019 NLP components and multilingual resources. Both for project-internal diagnostics and for training of domain-specific stochastic processes, the project requires a way of manually identifying intended analyses for a set of outputs obtained from batch parsing a development corpus. Besides, hand-picking the target reading(s) among parser outputs, of course, also helps identify (and thus suppress) legitimate but dis-preferred analyses. Such annotation immediately benefits the work on transfer (since transfer grammarians can focus on the analyses for each input that the NorGram developers find intended). Quite generally, it results in better quality MRSs (because of the regular in-depth scrutiny of each individual output). It further provides a foundation for work on training stochastic parse selection models, and we expect a medium-size MRS bank will suffice to train a domain-specific parse selection model for Norwegian. In a related spirit, Oepen, Flickinger, & Bond (2004) argue that maintaining a set of reference corpora in treebanked form throughout releases can be a valuable grammar engineering and regression testing facility. 2. Discriminant-Based Treebanking The LinGO Redwoods treebanking environment (Oepen et al., 2002; Oepen, Flickinger, Toutanova, & Manning, 2004) is a combination of two devices, viz. (i) a tree comparison tool for HPSG analyses (similar in spirit to the SRI Cambridge TreeBanker; Carter, 1997) and (ii) the [incr tsdb()] profiling environment (essentially a specialized database recording fine-grained parsing results obtained from a HPSG system; Oepen & Carroll, 2000). The LinGO Redwoods treebank of around 25,000 annotated utterances3 was constructed by batch processing domain corpora using the LinGO ERG, recording all results in [incr tsdb()], and subsequently having annotators select the preferred analysis for each input. Crucially, both the resulting preferences and all decisions made by annotators are recorded in the [incr tsdb()] database. The tree comparison tool presents annotators, one sentence at a time, with the full set of analyses produced by the grammar together with a condensed view of where the ambiguity The LinGO Redwoods treebank of English is another component in the open-source DELPH-IN repository; see \u2018http://www.delph-in.net/redwoods/\u2019 for specifics on the material included and its availability."

In this paper, we describe simple neural extensions of these techniques. First, we propose a natural generalization of the feature augmentation method that uses K + 1 LSTMs where one model captures global patterns across all K domains and the remaining K models capture domain-specific information. Second, we propose a novel application of the framework for learning shared structures by Ando and Zhang (2005) to domain adaptation, and also provide a neural extension of their approach. In experiments on slot tagging over 17 domains, our methods give clear performance improvement over Daum\u00e9 III (2009) applied on feature-rich CRFs."

It is a theoretically oriented treatment of a practical subject. Our motivation for making it so is threefold. \n \n(1) In an area as rapidly changing as Computer Science, sound pedagogy demands that courses emphasize ideas, rather than implementation details. It is our hope that the algorithms and concepts presented in this book will survive the next generation of computers and programming languages, and that at least some of them will be applicable to fields other than compiler writing. \n \n(2) Compiler writing has progressed to the point where many portions of a compiler can be isolated and subjected to design optimization. It is important that appropriate mathematical tools be available to the person attempting this optimization. \n \n(3) Some of the most useful and most efficient compiler algorithms, e.g. LR(k) parsing, require a good deal of mathematical background for full understanding. We expect, therefore, that a good theoretical background will become essential for the compiler designer. \n \nWhile we have not omitted difficult theorems that are relevant to compiling, we have tried to make the book as readable as possible. Numerous examples are given, each based on a small grammar, rather than on the large grammars encountered in practice. It is hoped that these examples are sufficient to illustrate the basic ideas, even in cases where the theoretical developments are difficult to follow in isolation. \n \nFrom volume 2 Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nCompiler design is one of the first major areas of systems programming for which a strong theoretical foundation is becoming available. Volume I of The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling developed the relevant parts of mathematics and language theory for this foundation and developed the principal methods of fast syntactic analysis. Volume II is a continuation of Volume I, but except for Chapters 7 and 8 it is oriented towards the nonsyntactic aspects of compiler design. \n \nThe treatment of the material in Volume II is much the same as in Volume I, although proofs have become a little more sketchy. We have tried to make the discussion as readable as possible by providing numerous examples, each illustrating one or two concepts. \n \nSince the text emphasizes concepts rather than language or machine details, a programming laboratory should accompany a course based on this book, so that a student can develop some facility in applying the concepts discussed to practical problems. The programming exercises appearing at the ends of sections can be used as recommended projects in such a laboratory. Part of the laboratory course should discuss the code to be generated for such programming language constructs as recursion, parameter passing, subroutine linkages, array references, loops, and so forth."

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning."
