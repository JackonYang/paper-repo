The sortings and explanations of 303 children, aged 5\u201311 years, and forty-two adults, aged 18\u201373 years, in grouping pictures of common objects, were analysed. The explanations were classified for both form and content. Five methods of explanation were distinguished, only two of which are recognised in logic. There were four main types of content, the most numerous at all ages being those concerned with spatial position and activity. The main developmental changes were found in methods of explanation. Older adults perform more like children than younger adults."

                "text": "Whether or not speech is special (as some would argue), it seems to us that there remain questions of great theoretical import concerning the relationship between speech and language; namely, What would language be like without speech? What properties of the complex phenomenon we call language-including its production and perception-are due to the mode of expression, i.e., due to the channel in which the more abstract entities are realized as physical, perceptible stuff, and what properties are due to some broader lingusitic faculty or to cognition in general? What sort of stamp does sound itself put on language? What would be the effect of other possible modes? Our small research group consisting of personnel a t The Salk Institute and a t the University of California a t San Diego is approaching these questions by using a n experimental situation provided by nature, that in which human beings are born deaf or become deaf during the prelingual period. We have purposely restricted our study to deaf people who are offspring of deaf parents and who learned as their first primary language the visual-gestural language called American Sign Language (ASL). By analyzing a language that utilizes a visual rather than a n auditory mode of perception, and a gestural rather than a vocal mode of production, we can begin to address the problem of the relationship between language and its physical realization. In this presentation we shall report on some of the findings of our studies including: I ) The status of sign language in terms of general visual symbolism and, in particular, the relationship between sign language and pantomime; 2) the way signs seem to be encoded and stored, according to results of experiments in the short-term memory paradigm and evidence from slips of the hand; 3) historical change in signs of ASL; and 4) the structure of sign language with special focus on the differences between sign language (ASL in particular) and spoken language (English in particular). Our emphasis will be on the interaction between the mode (in this case, the visual-gestural) and the more abstract linguistic and cognitive aspects of language. To begin with, however, it is best to dispel some misconceptions that commonly arise concerning the sign languages of the deaf. First, there is no single universal sign language. Rather, there are many different sign languages, just as there are many different spoken languages. These differ from one another most obviously in the form of the signs which they use, but also in the kinds of grammatical devices employed. Thus, despite the common written language in America and Great Britain, the sign"

It seems extraordinary, therefore, that so little progress has been made (and, indeed, that so little effort has been expended) toward the systematizing and quantifying of such factors. Our most precise knowledge of perception is in those areas which have yielded to psychophysical analysis (e.g., the perception of size, color, and pitch), but there is virtually no psychophysics of shape or pattern. Several difficulties may be pointed out at once: (a) Shape is a multidimensional variable, though it is often carelessly referred to as a \"dimension,\" along with brightness, hue, area, and the like, (b) The number of dimensions necessary to describe a shape is not fixed or constant, but increases with the complexity of the shape, (c) Even if we know how many dimensions are necessary in a given case, the choice of particular descriptive terms (i.e., of referenceaxes in the multidimensional space with which we are dealing) remains a problem; presumably some such terms have more psychological meaningfulness than others."

Yet students of language, especially psychologists and linguistic philosophers, have long been attuned to the fact that natural language concepts have vague boundaries and fuzzy edges and that, consequently, natural language sentences will very often be neither true, nor false, nor nonsensical, but rather true to a certain extent and false to a certain extent, true in certain respects and false in other respects."

                "text": "In this paper, we explore the rules that determine intuitive predictions and judgments of confidence and contrast these rules to the normative principles of statistical prediction. Two classes of prediction are discussed: category prediction and numerical prediction. In a categorical case, the prediction is given in nominal form, for example, the winner in an election, the diagnosis of a patient, or a person's future occupation. In a numerical case, the prediction is given in numerical form, for example, the future value of a particular stock or of a student's grade point average. In making predictions and judgments under uncertainty, people do not appear to follow the calculus of chance or the statistical theory of prediction. Instead, they rely on a limited number of heuristics which sometimes yield reasonable judgments and sometimes lead to severe and systematic errors (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972b, 3; Tversky & Kahneman, 1971, 2; 1973, 11). The present paper is concerned with the role of one of these heuristics \u2013 representativeness \u2013 in intuitive predictions. Given specific evidence (e.g., a personality sketch), the outcomes under consideration (e.g., occupations or levels of achievement) can be ordered by the degree to which they are representative of that evidence. The thesis of this paper is that people predict by representativeness, that is, they select or order outcomes by the degree to which the outcomes represent the essential features of the evidence."

                "text": "The present study compared sensitivity for auditory and visual signals in a simple detection task and in a related task in which ,9 was also imaging mental pictures and sounds. Sensitivity (rf') was reduced during imagery; within the imaging conditions, it was smaller when image and signal were both auditory or both visual than for cross-modal conditions and smaller with unfamiliar than familiar images. Likelihood ratio (Lx) was also smaller in the isomodal imaging conditions, as there were more visual false alarms during visual imagery and more auditory false alarms during auditory imagery. The data are not consistent with the assumption that d' is lower during imagery due to distraction; they do not entirely fit a channel competition model, but suggest that imagery functions as an internal signal which is confused with the external signal. Perky's (1910) effect has been difficult to explain: she found that if Os were asked to describe their images of common objects while dim facsimiles of the objects were presented before them, they reported only an \"imagery,\" not a \"perceptual,\" experience. This finding seemed paradoxical: in ordinary situations, imagery can be distinguished from real stimuli virtually 100% of the time; yet Perky's Os confused external stimuli with the images they were describing and seemed unable to discriminate the real physical signals. It is possible to explain the seeming inconsistency between Perky's experiment and everyday experience by inferring that the two events are at antipodal points on a continuum. The continuum would represent a class of conscious events characterized by activity in the sensory pathways and some central expectancies and memories, encompassing both"
