The projected image of such an object changes during rotation in a manner that is generally difficult to predict. An approach to this problem is suggested, using the 3D surface curvature at the points along the silhouette. The curvature information requires a single number for each point along the object\u2032s silhouette, the radial curvature at the point. We have implemented this method and tested it on images of complex 3D objects. Models of the viewed objects were acquired using three images of each object. The implemented scheme was found to give accurate predictions of the objects\u2032 appearances for large transformations. Using this method, a small number of (viewer-centered) models can be used to predict the new appearance of an object from any given viewpoint."

We propose a modeling system for generic objects to recognize different objects from the same category with only one generic model. We base our design of the modeling system upon the current psychological theories of categorization and human visual perception. The representation consists of a prototype represented by parts and their configuration. Parts are modeled by superquadric volumetric primitives which can be combined via Boolean operations to form objects. Variations between objects within a category are described by changes in structure and shape deformations of prototypical parts. Recovery of deformed supequadric models from sparse 3-D points is developed and some results are shown."

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

The first part of the paper reviews general approaches to visual object recognition and divides these approaches into three broad classes: invariant properties methods, object decomposition methods, and alignment methods. The second part presents the alignment method. In this approach the recognition process is divided into two stages. The first determines the transformation in space that is necessary to bring the viewed object into alignment with possible object-models. The second stage determines the model that best matches the viewed object. The proposed alignment method also uses abstract description, but unlike structural description methods, it uses them pictorially, rather than in symbolic structural descriptions."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

This problem is relevant not only to photographic surveying1 but also to binocular vision2, where the non-visual information available to the observer about the orientation and focal length of each eye is much less accurate than the optical information supplied by the retinal images themselves. The problem also arises in monocular perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for determining the distances of visible elements in the scene. I shall assume that the correspondence problem has been solved; the problem of reconstructing the scene then reduces to that of finding the relative orientation of the two viewpoints."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

In principle, this search space is enormous, and to control the potential combinatorial explosion, constraints between the data and model elements are needed. A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined. Known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems are used, together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy, three-dimensional sensory data, to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. It is shown that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously. The results are used to demonstrate the graceful degradation of the recognition technique with the presence of noise in the data, and to predict the number of data points needed, in general, to uniquely determine the object being sensed."

The zero crossings of \u22072G(x, y) \u2217 I(x, y) are located, as in Marr & Hildreth (1980). That is, the image is filtered through centre-surround receptive fields, and the zero values in the output are found. In addition, the time derivative \u2202[\u22072G(x, y) \u2217 l(x, y)]/\u2202t is measured at the zero crossings, and serves to constrain the local direction of motion to within 180\u00b0. The direction of motion can be determined in a second stage, for example by combining the local constraints. The second part of the paper suggests a specific model of the information processing by the X and Y cells of the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, and certain classes of cortical simple cells. A number of psychophysical and neurophysiological predictions are derived from the theory."
