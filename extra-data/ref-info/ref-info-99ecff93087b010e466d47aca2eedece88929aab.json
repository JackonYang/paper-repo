We describe the steps required in transforming the low-level PDF instructions into text segments, lines and boxes on a page. We propose three different classifications for published tables, and develop methods to detect these tables and correctly identify their respective rows and columns. We also explain how to recognize spanning rows and columns, and multi-line rows. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in converting a wide variety of tabular presentations into HTML for information extraction purposes."

Most information extraction (IE) systems ignore most of this visual information, processing the text as a linear sequence of words. Thus, much valuable information is lost. In this paper, we show how to make use of this visual information for IE. We present an algorithm that allows to automatically extract specific fields of the document (such as the title, author, etc.) based exclusively on the visual formatting of the document, without any reference to the semantic content. The algorithm employs a machine learning approach, whereby the system is first provided with a set of training documents in which the target fields are manually tagged and automatically learns how to extract these fields in future documents. We implemented the algorithm in a system for automatic analysis of documents in PDF format. We present experimental results of applying the system on a set of financial documents, extracting nine different target fields. Overall, the system achieved a 90% accuracy."

In this paper, we approach the problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attention from the tree-based representation of webpages to a variation of the two-dimensional visual box model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. The there by obtained topological and style information allows us to fill the gap created by missing domain-specific knowledge about content and table templates.

Although several sophisticated and indeed complex approaches were proposed, they are still limited in many aspects. In this paper the novel ontology-based system named XONTO, that allows the semantic extraction of information from PDF unstructured documents, is presented. The XONTO system is founded on the idea of self-describing ontologies in which objects and classes can be equipped by a set of rules named descriptors. These rules represent patterns that allow to automatically recognize and extract ontology objects contained in PDF documents also when information is arranged in tabular form. This way a self-describing ontology expresses the semantic of the information to extract and the rules that, in turn, populate itself. In the paper XONTO system behaviors and structure are sketched by means of a running example."

Therefore we developed a complete benchmarking environment, containing a user front-end to acquire ground truth data as well as mechanisms to evaluate the quality of the recognition results. The tasks involved in the analysis systems were the locating of table regions, identification of cells and mapping of cells to rows and columns. This paper presents our approach towards the comparison of recognition results with the ground truth. The established definitions of recall and precision did not meet our requirements, as we wanted to register even smallest improvements (or changes in general) in the results, even when both results were imperfect. We therefore extended the measures recall and precision in order to deal with recognition probabilities of objects rather than just with Boolean values."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations, and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies both the decisions made by a table recognizer and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overviewof pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval."
