The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods."

This framework is well suited for the task of learning object classifiers from weakly labeled image data, where only the presence of an object in an image is known, but not its location. Some recent work has explored the application of MIL algorithms to the tasks of image categorization and natural scene classification. In this paper we extend these ideas in a framework that uses MIL to recognize and localizeobjects in images. To achieve this we employ state of the art image descriptors and multiple stable segmentations. These components, combined with a powerful MIL algorithm, form our object recognition system called MILSS. We show highly competitive object categorization results on the Caltech dataset. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm further, we introduce the challenging Landmarks-18 dataset, a collection of photographs of famous landmarks from around the world. The results on this new dataset show the great potential of our proposed algorithm."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

We introduce LOCUS (learning object classes with unsupervised segmentation) which uses a generative probabilistic model to combine bottom-up cues of color and edge with top-down cues of shape and pose. A key aspect of this model is that the object appearance is allowed to vary from image to image, allowing for significant within-class variation. By iteratively updating the belief in the object's position, size, segmentation and pose, LOCUS avoids making hard decisions about any of these quantities and so allows for each to be refined at any stage. We show that LOCUS successfully learns an object class model from unlabeled images, whilst also giving segmentation accuracies that rival existing supervised methods. Finally, we demonstrate simultaneous recognition and segmentation in novel images using the learned models for a number of object classes, as well as unsupervised object discovery and tracking in video."

The first step of our method consists of clustering local scale-invariant descriptors to characterize object class appearance. Next, we train on the groups, and perform feature selection to determine the most discriminative parts. We use local regions to realize robust and sparse part and texture selection invariant to changes in scale, orientation and affine deformation and, as a result, we avoid image normalization in both training and prediction phases. We train our object models without requiring image parts to be labeled or objects to be separated from the background. Moreover, our method continues to work well when images have cluttered background and occluded objects. We evaluate our method on seven recently proposed datasets, and quantitatively compare the effect of different types of local regions and feature selection criteria on object recognition. Our experiments show that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for many different object classes. Our results also confirm the importance of appearance-based discriminative feature selection."

Transferring knowledge from such models to new object classes trained from a few or even as little as one training instance however is still in its infancy. This paper designs a shape-based model that allows to easily and explicitly transfer knowledge on three different levels: transfer of individual parts' shape and appearance information, transfer of local symmetry between parts, and transfer of part topology. Due to the factorized form of the model, knowledge can either be transferred for the complete model or just partial knowledge corresponding to certain aspects of the model. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the state-of-the-art and enables both full and partial knowledge transfer."

                "text": "Visual categorization problems, such as object classification or action recognition, are increasingly often approached using a detection strategy: a classifier function is first applied to candidate subwindows of the image or the video, and then the maximum classifier score is used for class decision. Traditionally, the subwindow classifiers are trained on a large collection of examples manually annotated with masks or bounding boxes. The reliance on time-consuming human labeling effectively limits the application of these methods to problems involving very few categories. Furthermore, the human selection of the masks introduces arbitrary biases (e.g. in terms of window size and location) which may be suboptimal for classification. In this paper we propose a novel method for learning a discriminative subwindow classifier from examples annotated with binary labels indicating the presence of an object or action of interest, but not its location. During training, our approach simultaneously localizes the instances of the positive class and learns a subwindow SVM to recognize them. We extend our method to classification of time series by presenting an algorithm that localizes the most discriminative set of temporal segments in the signal. We evaluate our approach on several datasets for object and action recognition and show that it achieves results similar and in many cases superior to those obtained with full supervision."

This method learns both a model of local part appearance and a model of the spatial relations between those parts. In contrast, other work using such a weakly supervised learning paradigm has not considered the problem of simultaneously learning appearance and spatial models. Some of these methods use a \u201cbag\u201d model where only part appearance is considered whereas other methods learn spatial models but only given the output of a particular feature detector. Previous techniques for learning both part appearance and spatial relations have instead used a highly supervised learning process that provides substantial information about object part location. We show that our weakly supervised technique produces better results than these previous highly supervised methods. Moreover, we investigate the degree to which both richer spatial models and richer appearance models are helpful in improving recognition performance. Our results show that while both spatial and appearance information can be useful, the effect on performance depends substantially on the particular object class and on the difficulty of the test dataset."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. This includes an innovative cue measuring the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure [17], and the combined measure to perform better than any cue alone. Finally, we show how to sample windows from an image according to their objectness distribution and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. In experiments on PASCAL VOC 07 we show this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by class-specific object detectors."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

While often a critical cue at the category-level, contour matches can be difficult to isolate reliably from edge clutter-even within labeled images from a known class, let alone unlabeled examples. We propose a shape discovery method in which local appearance (patch) matches serve to anchor the surrounding edge fragments, yielding a more reliable affinity function for images that accounts for both shape and appearance. Spectral clustering from the initial affinities provides candidate object clusters. Then, we compute the within-cluster match patterns to discern foreground edges from clutter, attributing higher weight to edges more likely to belong to a common object. In addition to discovering the object contours in each image, we show how to summarize what is found with prototypical shapes. Our results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the approach can successfully discover shapes from unlabeled images."

As in previous methods, we first use training images to extract fragments that contain common object parts. We then show how these parts can be segmented into their figure and ground regions in an automatic learning process. This is in contrast with previous approaches, which required complete manual segmentation of the objects in the training examples. The figure-ground learning combines top-down and bottom-up processes and proceeds in two stages, an initial approximation followed by iterative refinement. The initial approximation produces figure-ground labeling of individual image fragments using the unsegmented training images. It is based on the fact that on average, points inside the object are covered by more fragments than points outside it. The initial labeling is then improved by an iterative refinement process, which converges in up to three steps. At each step, the figure-ground labeling of individual fragments produces a segmentation of complete objects in the training images, which in turn induce a refined figure-ground labeling of the individual fragments. In this manner, we obtain a scheme that starts from unsegmented training images, learns the figure-ground labeling of image fragments, and then uses this labeling to segment novel images. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned segmentation achieves the same level of accuracy as methods using manual segmentation of training images, producing an automatic and robust top-down segmentation."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations.

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

To estimate the object's location, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost because the classifier or similarity function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch and bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of quality functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in linear or even sublinear time, in contrast to the quadratic scaling of exhaustive or sliding window search. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and image retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest-neighbor classifiers based on the lambda2 distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art localization performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars data set, the PASCAL VOC 2006 data set, and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

This paper is aimed at simultaneously solving the following related problems: (1) unsupervised identification of photometric, geometric, and topological (mutual containment) properties of multiscale regions defining objects in the category; (2) learning a region-based structural model of the category in terms of these properties from a set of training images; and (3) segmentation and recognition of objects from the category in new images. To this end, each image is represented by a tree that captures a multiscale image segmentation. The trees are matched to find the maximally matching subtrees across the set, the existence of which is itself viewed as evidence that a category is indeed present. The matched subtrees are fused into a canonical tree, which represents the learned model of the category. Recognition of objects in a new image and image segmentation delineating all object parts are achieved simultaneously by finding matches of the model with subtrees of the new image. Experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed approach has similar recognition and superior localization performance while it uses fewer training examples."

The proposed approach discovers highly probable regions of object instances by iteratively repeating the following two functions: (1) choose the exemplar set (i.e. a small number of highly ranked reference ROIs) across the dataset and (2) refine the ROIs of each image with respect to the exemplar set. These two subproblems are formulated as ranking in two different similarity networks of ROI hypotheses by link analysis. The experiments with the PASCAL 06 dataset show that our unsupervised localization performance is better than one of state-of-the-art techniques and comparable to supervised methods. Also, we test the scalability of our approach with five objects in Flickr dataset consisting of more than 200K images."

The most accredited hypothesis is that humans are able to exploit prior knowledge when learning a new related category. This paper presents an SVM-based model adaptation algorithm able to perform knowledge transfer for a new category when very limited examples are available. Using a leave- one-out estimate of the weighted error-rate the algorithm automatically decides from where to transfer (on which known category to rely), how much to transfer (the degree of adaptation) and if it is worth transferring something at all. Moreover a weighted least-squares loss function takes optimally care of data unbalance between negative and positive examples. Experiments presented on two different object category databases show that the proposed method is able to exploit previous knowledge avoiding negative transfer. The overall classification performance is increased compared to what would be achieved by starting from scratch. Furthermore as the number of already learned categories grows, the algorithm is able to learn a new category from one sample with increasing precision, i.e. it is able to perform one-shot learning."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

                "text": "We present a novel generative model for simultaneously recognizing and segmenting object and scene classes. Our model is inspired by the traditional bag of words representation of texts and images as well as a number of related generative models, including probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). A major drawback of the pLSA and LDA models is the assumption that each patch in the image is independently generated given its corresponding latent topic. While such representation provides an efficient computational method, it lacks the power to describe the visually coherent images and scenes. Instead, we propose a spatially coherent latent topic model (spatial-LTM). Spatial-LTM represents an image containing objects in a hierarchical way by over-segmented image regions of homogeneous appearances and the salient image patches within the regions. Only one single latent topic is assigned to the image patches within each region, enforcing the spatial coherency of the model. This idea gives rise to the following merits of spatial-LTM: (1) spatial-LTM provides a unified representation for spatially coherent bag of words topic models; (2) spatial-LTM can simultaneously segment and classify objects, even in the case of occlusion and multiple instances; and (3) spatial-LTM can be trained either unsupervised or supervised, as well as when partial object labels are provided. We verify the success of our model in a number of segmentation and classification experiments."

We r st evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classier s. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest.

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

We do not assume that the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance. When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be learned for this representation."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

In this paper, several different approaches to lifelong learning are described, and applied in an object recognition domain.

The key to our approach is to view the estimation of multiple motion models as the estimation of a single multibody motion model. This is possible thanks to two important algebraic facts. First, we show that all the image measurements, regardless of their associated motion model, can be fit with a real or complex polynomial. Second, we show that the parameters of the motion model associated with an image measurement can be obtained from the derivatives of the polynomial at the measurement. This leads to a novel motion segmentation algorithm that applies to most of the two-view motion models adopted in computer vision. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algebraic methods in terms of efficiency and robustness, and provides a good initialization for iterative techniques, such as EM, which is strongly dependent on correct initialization."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

                "text": "Algorithms for discrete energy minimization are of fundamental importance in computer vision. In this paper, we focus on the recent technique proposed by Wainwright et al. (Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"
