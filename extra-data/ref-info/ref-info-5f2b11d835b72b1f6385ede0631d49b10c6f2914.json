Impressive detection results have been achieved for many objects such as faces [11, 14, 9] and cars [11]. The robustness of these systems emerges from a training stage utilizing thousands of positive examples. One approach to enable learning from a small set of training examples is to find an efficient set of features that accurately represent the target object. Unfortunately, automatically selecting such a feature set is a difficult task in itself. In this paper we present a novel feature selection method that is based on the notion of object categories. We assume that when learning to recognize a new object (like an apple) we also know a category it belongs to (fruit). We further assume that features that are useful for learning other objects in the same category (e.g. pear or orange) will also be useful for learning the novel object. This leads to a simple criterion for selecting features and building classifiers. We show that our method gives significant improvement in detection performance in challenging domains."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

The results demonstrate the superiority of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality, using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning."

However, these methods usually rely on a huge training database (around 5,000 positive examples for good performance). While such huge databases may be feasible for building a system that detects a single object, it is obviously problematic for scenarios where multiple objects (or multiple views of a single object) need to be detected. Indeed, even for multi-viewface detection the performance of existing systems is far from satisfactory. In this work we focus on the problem of learning to detect objects from a small training database. We show that performance depends crucially on the features that are used to represent the objects. Specifically, we show that using local edge orientation histograms (EOH) as features can significantly improve performance compared to the standard linear features used in existing systems. For frontal faces, local orientation histograms enable state of the art performance using only a few hundred training examples. For profile view faces, local orientation histograms enable learning a system that seems to outperform the state of the art in real-time systems even with a small number of training examples."

Our main contribution is a novel object representation scheme using \u2018extended fragments\u2019 that enables us to achieve a high level of recognition performance and generalization across a wide range of viewing conditions. Extended fragments are equivalence classes of image fragments that represent informative object parts under different viewing conditions. They are extracted automatically from short video sequences during learning. Using this representation, the scheme is unique in its ability to generalize from a single view of a novel object and compensate for a significant change in viewing direction without using 3D information. As a result, novel objects can be recognized from viewing directions from which they were not seen in the past. Experiments demonstrate that the scheme achieves significantly better generalization and recognition performance than previously used methods."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

                "text": "We describe an approach to object classification based on the conjunction of multiple classspecific object fragments detected in the image. The method represents members of a given class (such as a face, or a car) using combinations of common sub-structures, termed fragments. These fragments are partial 2-D patterns extracted from examples views of objects belonging to the class in question. An object view is covered by multiple, overlapping fragments of several types, and at multiple levels of complexity. We describe the detection of the individual fragments, and the combination of the fragments to detect complete objects. The combination of fragments to form a consistent overall arrangement is based in this scheme on a number of simple mechanisms: the use of overlapping fragments, a spatial `voting' scheme, and by imposing some constraints on the tolerated location of the fragments within the overall object view. We present experimental results of the application of the method to the detection of face and car views in cluttered scenes and to partially occluded objects. We present evidence that by combining fragments from different objects the method can deal successfully with intra-object variability within a class. The method is more economical and more resistant to occlusion and deformations than methods relying on global object views. Introduction In this paper we study the challenging task of detecting different objects from a given class (such as a face or a car) in an image. In addition to the unknown location and illumination of the object, the method must deal with intra-class variability between objects from the same class. The detection process must therefore cover a range of possible shapes, missing parts and additional clutter. To deal with the problem of shape variability and detect novel shapes of a given class, Turk & Pentland (1991) used the principal components of registered face views. Views of novel objects can be approximated by the superposition of several basis functions, or 'eigenfaces'. Poggio & Sung (1994) used a distribution-based modeling scheme for detecting faces in cluttered scenes. They represented a face view as a gray level vector with 283 components, and trained a multi-layered preceptron network to classify such data as face/non-face vectors. The generalization to novel shapes within the class is obtained in these schemes by the inherent generalization capacity of the neural network mechanism.

Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes, and demonstrate how using this density as \"prior knowledge\" can be used to develop a classifier based on only a single training example for each class."

Each object is learned from a single training image and modeled by the visual appearance of a set of features, and their position with respect to a common reference frame. The recognition process computes identity and position of objects in the scene by finding the best interpretation of the scene in terms of learned objects. Features detected in an input image are either paired with database features, or marked as clutters. Each hypothesis is scored using a generative model of the image which is defined using the learned objects and a model for clutter. While the space of possible hypotheses is enormously large, one may find the best hypothesis efficiently \u2013 we explore some heuristics to do so. Our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art recognition systems."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

                "text": "Object recognition concerns itself with two questions: What is the form of object representation? and How do observers match object percepts to object representations? Many objects look similar and most contain no single feature that uniquely identifies them. Furthermore, objects are rarely seen under identical viewing conditions: Objects change their size, position, orientation, and relations between parts, viewers move about, and sources of illumination turn on and off or move. Successful object recognition requires generalizing across such changes. Two different approaches to these issues have been adopted. Viewpoint-invariant theories assume that there are specific invariant cues to object identity that may be recovered under almost all viewing conditions. Viewpoint-dependent theories suggest that no such general invariants exist and that object features are represented much as they appeared when originally viewed, thereby preserving shape information and surface appearance. Despite many differences, theories of object recognition include some common principles. These include the decomposition of an image into component features, the coding of the spatial relations between such features, multiple views to represent feature sets arising from different object viewpoints, generalization mechanisms to normalize over changes in viewing conditions, and the flexibility to support recognition tasks ranging from item-specific individuation to basic-level categorization. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nframes of reference; \nimage normalization; \nimage-based models; \nstructural description models; \nviewpoint-dependent recognition; \nviewpoint-invariant recognition"

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

For each viewpoint, we construct a decision rule that determines if the object is present at that specific orientation. Each decision rule uses the statistics of both object appearance and \u201cnon-object\u201d visual appearance. We represent each set of statistics using a product of histograms. Each histogram represents the joint statistics of a subset of wavelet coefficients and their position on the object. Our approach is to use many such histograms representing a wide variety of visual attributes. Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect faces that vary from frontal view to full profile view and the first algorithm that can reliably detect cars over a wide range of viewpoints."
