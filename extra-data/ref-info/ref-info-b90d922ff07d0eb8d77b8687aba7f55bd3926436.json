This paper extends Ferguson's result to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a parameter which determines the distribution from which observations are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay, discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given."

Implementation of Gibbs sampling in more general MDP models is an open and important problem because most applications call for the use of nonconjugate base measures. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for computational strategies. This framework provides a perspective on current methods, facilitates comparisons between them, and leads to several new methods that expand the scope of MDP models to nonconjugate situations. We discuss one in detail. The basic strategy is based on expanding the parameter vector, and is applicable for MDP models with arbitrary base measure and likelihood. Strategies are also presented for the important class of normal-normal MDP models and..."

We call it \u201canalysis of densities\u201d to emphasize the similarity with analysis of variance. The difference is that the usual analysis of variance models the variance of a scalar across subjects and here we model the variability of probability density functions across subjects. The probability density functions for different subjects are modelled as mixtures of Dirichlet processes. A common baseline prior distribution for the mixing distribution is assumed. The similarity between density estimates for different subjects is controlled by the precision parameters of the subjectspecific Dirichlet processes. The common baseline prior is also estimated using a mixture-of-Dirichlet-processes model. For this second Dirichlet process, the precision parameter controls how much detail from the individual density estimates is captured in the estimate of the baseline prior. Fitting the model involves a large Gibbs-sampling scheme to obtain samples of predictive densities from their posterior distribution. To measure how far any density deviates from the average, the Hellinger distance is used. Mainly, we present the results graphically to highlight structure in the data, but we also show how probability statements can be made based on the distribution of these distances."

It is shown that the DP partition distribution is a limiting case of a Dirichlet\u2013multinomial allocation model. Comparisons of posterior performance of DP and allocation models are made in the Bayesian paradigm and illustrated in the context of univariate mixture models. It is shown in particular that the unbalancedness of the allocation distribution, present in the prior DP model, persists a posteriori. Exploiting the model connections, a new MCMC sampler for general DP based models is introduced, which uses split/merge moves in a reversible jump framework. Performance of this new sampler relative to that of some traditional samplers for DP processes is then explored."

One new approach is to make Metropolis\u2014Hastings updates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of Gibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways of handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate priors."

Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian mixture models, such as Gibbs sampling, can become trapped in isolated modes corresponding to an inappropriate clustering of data points. This article describes a Metropolis-Hastings procedure that can escape such local modes by splitting or merging mixture components. Our algorithm employs a new technique in which an appropriate proposal for splitting or merging components is obtained by using a restricted Gibbs sampling scan. We demonstrate empirically that our method outperforms the Gibbs sampler in situations where two or more components are similar in structure."

Examples of random measures that have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter extension, the two-parameter Poisson\u2013Dirichlet process, finite dimensional Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure for fitting them. In this article we present two general types of Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler, referred to as a P\u00f3lya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with a known P\u00f3lya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure. The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We find that the blocked Gibbs avoids some of the limitations seen with the P\u00f3lya urn approach and should be simpler for nonexperts to use."

A Bayesian uses a prior distribution for P, and after observing X, solves the statistical inference problem by using the posterior distribution of P, which is the conditional distribution of P given X. For Bayesian nonparametrics to be successful one needs a large class of priors for which posterior distributions can be easily calculated. Unless X takes values in a finite space, the unknown distribution P varies in an infinite dimensional space. Thus one has to talk about measures in a complicated space like the space of all probability measures on a large space. This has always required a more careful attention to the attendant measure theoretic problems. A class of priors known as Dirichlet measures have been used for the distribution of a random variable X when it takes values in R sub K."

For example, the random distributions might be indexed by a categorical covariate indicating the treatment levels in a clinical trial and might represent random effects distributions under the respective treatment combinations. We propose a model that describes dependence across random distributions in an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-type fashion. We define a probability model in such a way that marginally each random measure follows a Dirichlet process (DP) and use the dependent Dirichlet process to define the desired dependence across the related random measures. The resulting probability model can alternatively be described as a mixture of ANOVA models with a DP prior on the unknown mixing measure. The main features of the proposed approach are ease of interpretation and computational simplicity. Because the model follows the standard ANOVAstructure, interpretation and inference parallels conventions for ANOVA models. This includes the notion of main effects, interactions, contrasts, and the like. Of course, the analogies are limited to structure and interpretation. The actual objects of the inference are random distributions instead of the unknown normal means in standard ANOVA models. Besides interpretation and model structure, another important feature of the proposed approach is ease of posterior simulation. Because the model can be rewritten as a DP mixture of ANOVAmodels, it inherits all computational advantages of standard DP mixture models. This includes availability of efficient Gibbs sampling schemes for posterior simulation and ease of implementation of even high-dimensional applications. Complexity of implementing posterior simulation is\u2014at least conceptually\u2014dimension independent."

They consider in particular the gamma process construction of Ferguson (1973) and the \u201cstick\u2010breaking\u201d construction of Sethuraman (1994). They propose a Dirichlet finite sum representation that strongly approximates the Dirichlet process. They assess the accuracy of this approximation and characterize the posterior that this new prior leads to in the context of Bayesian nonpara\u2010metric hierarchical models."

Analogous to parametric hierarchical models, the hierarchical extension formalizes borrowing strength across the related submodels. In the nonparametric context, modelling is complicated by the fact that the random quantities over which we define the hierarchy are infinite dimensional. We discuss a formal definition of such a hierarchical model. The approach includes a regression at the level of the nonparametric model. For the special case of Dirichlet process mixtures, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme to allow efficient implementation of full posterior inference in the given model."

For text collections, we posit that a document is generated by choosing a random set of multinomial probabilities for a set of possible \u201ctopics,\u201d and then repeatedly generating words by sampling from the topic mixture. This model is intractable for exact probabilistic inference, but approximate posterior probabilities and marginal likelihoods can be obtained via fast variational methods. We also present extensions to coupled models for joint text/image data and multiresolution models for topic hierarchies."

The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a finite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be infinite\u2014 consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text."

The structure of this set of parameters, in terms of independence, exchangeability, partial exchangeability, etc., is assumed to be unknown and a finite number of possible structures are entertained, each with an associated prior weight representing the degree of belief in that structure. Crucial is the criterion by which these structures are selected. The final inference for the parameter values is taken to be the average, with respect to the posterior weights, of the values obtained from each structure. This is performed within a Bayesian nonparametric framework where the form of the prior distribution for the parameters is unrestricted. Therefore we do not assume that the distributions associated with a partial structure are from the same family. Different types of experiment suggest different types of distributions of parameters associated with each type of experiment."

                "text": "The prior distribution is an essential ingredient of any Bayesian analysis, and it plays a major role in determining the final results. As such, Bayesians attempt to use prior distributions that have certain properties. Perhaps the main property is a desire to accurately reflect prior information, i.e., information external to the experiment at hand. We would supplement this vague property with a second equally vague property. The posterior distribution should exhibit behavior that is qualitatively acceptable. The second property for prior distributions is vague, but carries with it several implications. An immediate implication is that we should dispense with parametric Bayesian models in all but the simplest of settings! This perhaps surprising implication follows from an examination of various cases. As a case in point, consider a survival analysis setting where there is a follow-up period of limited duration. With large samples, one could hope to learn the survival distribution over the follow-up period, but there is no hope of learning the exact distribution of survival times beyond the follow-up period. In Bayesian terms, with large samples, the posterior distribution within the follow-up period would be concentrated near the actual survival distribution while the posterior distribution beyond the follow-up period would not concentrate. In the limit, as the experiment tended to one of infinite size, the posterior distribution would ideally tend to a degenerate (and correct) distribution within the follow-up period but would not tend to a degenerate distribution beyond the follow-up period. In a similar fashion, if event times are recorded on a scale of limited precision (for example, in terms of months), one might hope to learn the survival distribution on the monthly scale, but would have no hope of learning the exact distribution on a finer scale. Parametric prior distributions will typically provide degenerate inference over the entire survival distribution and to infinite precision with only limited precision, limited follow-up data. Often, one only needs a discrete observation space consisting of p + 1 possible values in order to obtain a degenerate posterior distribution in the limit for a p dimensional parametric model."

The generalized linear model is useful for data that have non-normal errors but where the errors are uncorrelated. A descendant of these two models generates a model for correlated data with non-normal errors, called the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Frequentist attempts to fit these models generally rely on approximate results and inference relies on asymptotic assumptions. Recent advances in computing technology have made Bayesian approaches to this class of models computationally feasible. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be used to obtain 'exact' inference for these models, as demonstrated by Zeger and Karim. In the linear or generalized linear mixed model, the random effects are typically taken to have a fully parametric distribution, such as the normal distribution. In this paper, we extend the GLMM by allowing the random effects to have a non-parametric prior distribution. We do this using a Dirichlet process prior for the general distribution of the random effects. The approach easily extends to more general population models. We perform computations for the models using the Gibbs sampler."

The effects of the explanatory variables on the response are modelled via both the parameters of the mean distribution function of the Dirichlet process and the total mass parameter. We discuss modelling options and relationships with other approaches.

A number of interesting differences from smoothing emerge. The insights gained from a probabilistic view of this problem point towards new directions for language modelling. The ideas of this paper are also applicable to other problems such as the modelling of triphomes in speech, and DNA and protein sequences in molecular biology. The new algorithm is compared with smoothing on a two million word corpus. The methods prove to be about equally accurate, with the hierarchical model using fewer computational resources."

These models provide natural settings for density estimation and are exemplified by special cases where data are modeled as a sample from mixtures of normal distributions. Efficient simulation methods are used to approximate various prior, posterior, and predictive distributions. This allows for direct inference on a variety of practical issues, including problems of local versus global smoothing, uncertainty about density estimates, assessment of modality, and the inference on the numbers of components. Also, convergence results are established for a general class of normal mixture models."

We shall say that a random probability measure P* on X has a Ferguson distribution with parameter p if for every finite partition (B1, * . *, B) of X the vector p*(B,), * * *, p*(B,) has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter (Bj), *--, cp(B,) (when p(B,) = 0, this means p*(B,) = 0 with probability 1). Ferguson (3) has shown that, for any p, Ferguson p* exist and when used as prior distributions yield Bayesian counterparts to well-known classical nonpa- rametric tests. He also shows that p* is a.s. discrete. His approach involves a rather deep study of the gamma process. One of us (1) has given a different and perhaps simpler proof that Ferguson priors concentrate on discrete distributions. In this note we give still a third approach to Ferguson distributions, exploiting their connection with generalized Polya urn schemes. We shall say that a sequence (X,, n > 1} of random variables with values in X is a Poilya sequence with parameter 1a if for every B c X (1) P(X1 e B) = p(B)/p(X) and (2) P{X,+1 e B I1 **,, X = pn(B)/1p(X) where p. = p + 3 l(Xi) and 3(x) denotes the unit measure concentrating at x. Note that, for finite X, the sequence {XJ} represents the results of successive draws from an urn where initially the urn has p(x) balls of color x and, after each draw, the ball drawn is replaced and another ball of its same color is added to the urn. Note also that, without the restriction to finite X, for any (Borel measurable) function zS on X, the sequence {0(X\")} is a P6lya sequence with parameter qSp, where q4(A) = p{l e Al. We now describe the connections between Polya sequences and Ferguson distributions."

We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation.

Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propagation algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectationmaximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM algorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models. It is shown how model selection tasks such as determining the dimensionality, cardinality, or number of variables are possible using VB approximations. Also explored are methods for combining sampling procedures with variational approximations, to estimate the tightness of VB bounds and to obtain more effective sampling algorithms. Chapter 6 applies VB learning to a long-standing problem of scoring discrete-variable directed acyclic graphs, and compares the performance to annealed importance sampling amongst other methods. Throughout, the VB approximation is compared to other methods including sampling, Cheeseman-Stutz, and asymptotic approximations such as BIC. The thesis concludes with a discussion of evolving directions for model selection including infinite models and alternative approximations to the marginal likelihood."

We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

In that paper the authors consider a location problem and base their procedure on a continuous loss function. This loss function takes into account the \u201cdistance\u201d, in parameter values, between the populations under consideration and the best one among the ones in the selected subset. In defining this \u201cdistance\u201d, they incorporate the notion of \u201ce-best\u201d studied by, e.g., Desu [2], Lam [3], van der Laan [4], Gill and Sharma [5] and Gill, Sharma and Misra [6]. As an example of their results, van der Laan and van Eeden [1] consider the case of two normal populations with equal known variances. The present paper develops a similar procedure for scale parameters. The case of two gamma populations with equal known shape parameters is studied in detail."

The method is adaptive: as sampling proceeds, the rejection envelope and the squeezing function converge to the density function. The rejection envelope and squeezing function are piecewise exponential functions, the rejection envelope touching the density at previously sampled points, and the squeezing function forming arcs between those points of contact. The technique is intended for situations where evaluation of the density is computationally expensive, in particular for applications of Gibbs sampling to Bayesian models with non-conjugacy. We apply the technique to a Gibbs sampling analysis of monoclonal antibody reactivity."

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field."

A Dirichlet process distribution is assigned to each of the response curves as a first stage prior. A second stage prior is then used to model the hyperparameters. We define parameters which will be used to compare the response curves. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to compute the resulting Bayesian estimates. To illustrate the methodology, we re-examine data from an experiment designed to test whether experimenter observation influences the ultimatum game. A major restriction of the original analysis was the shape constraint that the present technique allows us to greatly relax. We also consider independent priors and use Bayes factors to compare various models."

As part of The SNP Consortium Allele Frequency Projects, we characterized haplotype patterns across 51 autosomal regions (spanning 13 megabases of the human genome) in samples from Africa, Europe, and Asia. We show that the human genome can be parsed objectively into haplotype blocks: sizable regions over which there is little evidence for historical recombination and within which only a few common haplotypes are observed. The boundaries of blocks and specific haplotypes they contain are highly correlated across populations. We demonstrate that such haplotype frameworks provide substantial statistical power in association studies of common genetic variation across each region. Our results provide a foundation for the construction of a haplotype map of the human genome, facilitating comprehensive genetic association studies of human disease."

Haplotypes can be obtained, at considerable cost, experimentally or (partially) through genotyping of additional family members. Alternatively, a statistical method can be used to infer phase and to reconstruct haplotypes. We present a new statistical method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci from a population sample, that improves substantially on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced by > 50%, relative to its nearest competitor. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well in absolute terms, suggesting that reconstructing haplotypes experimentally or by genotyping additional family members may be an inefficient use of resources."

The probabilistic paradigm pays tribute to the inherent uncertainty in robot perception, relying on explicit representations of uncertainty when determining what to do. This article surveys some of the progress in the field, using in-depth examples to illustrate some of the nuts and bolts of the basic approach. My central conjecture is that the probabilistic approach to robotics scales better to complex real-world applications than approaches that ignore a robot's uncertainty."

On the other hand, the conditional distribution (41) suggests that the \u03b2 w ights are conjugate in some manner to the auxiliary variables mjk. This raises the question of the meaning of the mjk variables. The conditional distribution (40) of mjk gives us a hint. Consider again the Chinese restaurant franchise, in particular the prob ability that we obtainm tables corresponding to component k in mixture j, given that we know the component to which each data item in mixture j is assigned (i.e., we knowz), and we know\u03b2 (i.e., we are given the sampleG0). Notice that the number of tables in fact plays no role in the likelihood since we already know which component each data item comes from. Furthermore, the probab ility that i is assigned to some tablet such thatkjt = k is p(tji = t|kjt = k,mji,\u03b2, \u03b10) \u221d n \u2212i jt , (44) while the probability that i is assigned a new table under component k is p(tji = t |kjtnew = k,mji,\u03b2, \u03b10) \u221d \u03b10\u03b2k . (45) This shows that the distribution over the assignment of observations to tables is in fact equal to the distribution over the assignment of observations to components in an ordin ary Dirichlet process with concentration parameter \u03b10\u03b2k, given thatnjk samples are observed from the Dirichlet process. Antoniak (1974) has shown that this induces a distribution over the number of components:"
