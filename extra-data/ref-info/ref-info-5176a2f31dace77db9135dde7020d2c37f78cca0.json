The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical communityhas been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit- ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob- lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theoryand practice, has developed rapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move awayfrom exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools."
