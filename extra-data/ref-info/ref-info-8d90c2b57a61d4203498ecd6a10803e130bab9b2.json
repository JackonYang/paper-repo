A well-known person detector -- the Implicit Shape Model (ISM) approach introduced by Leibe et al. -- is shown not only to be well suited to detect persons, but can also be exploited to derive a person's pose. Therefore, we extend the original voting approach of ISM and let all visual words that contribute to a person hypothesis also vote for the positions of the person's body parts. Since this approach is not constrained to a certain feature type and different feature types can even be fused during the pose estimation process, the approach is highly flexible. We show preliminary evaluation results of our approach using on the public available HumanEva dataset which comprises ground-truth pose data and thereby provides training and evaluation data."

These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model. These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence. Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion. To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model. We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods."

Previous works either use local deformable models deviating from a certain template, or use a global mixture representation in the pose space. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical spatial model that can capture an exponential number of poses with a compact mixture representation on each part. Using latent nodes, it can represent high-order spatial relationship among parts with exact inference. Different from recent hierarchical models that associate each latent node to a mixture of appearance templates (like HoG), we use the hierarchical structure as a pure spatial prior avoiding the large and often confounding appearance space. We verify the effectiveness of this model in three ways. First, samples representing human-like poses can be drawn from our model, showing its ability to capture high-order dependencies of parts. Second, our model achieves accurate reconstruction of unseen poses compared to a nearest neighbor pose representation. Finally, our model achieves state-of-art performance on three challenging datasets, and substantially outperforms recent hierarchical models."

This is extremely challenging because of variation in pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

Without assuming a priori knowledge of scale, pose or appearance, this problem is extremely challenging and demands the use of all possible sources of information. We develop a framework which can incorporate arbitrary pairwise constraints between body parts, such as scale compatibility, relative position, symmetry of clothing and smooth contour connections between parts. We detect candidate body parts from bottom-up using parallelism, and use various pairwise configuration constraints to assemble them together into body configurations. To find the most probable configuration, we solve an integer quadratic programming problem with a standard technique using linear approximations. Approximate IQP allows us to incorporate much more information than the traditional dynamic programming and remains computationally efficient. 15 hand-labeled images are used to train the low-level part detector and learn the pairwise constraints. We show test results on a variety of images."

In this paper, we consider the use of multiple tree models, rather than a single tree model for human pose estimation. Our model can alleviate the limitations of a single tree-structured model by combining information provided across different tree models. The parameters of each individual tree model are trained via standard learning algorithms in a single tree-structured model. Different tree models can be combined in a discriminative fashion by a boosting procedure. We present experimental results showing the improvement of our approaches on two different datasets.

Unfortunately, articulated objects are also very difficult to detect. Knowledge about the articulated nature of these objects, however, can substantially contribute to the task of finding them in an image. It is somewhat surprising, that these two tasks are usually treated entirely separately. In this paper, we propose an Articulated Part-based Model (APM) for jointly detecting objects and estimating their poses. APM recursively represents an object as a collection of parts at multiple levels of detail, from coarse-to-fine, where parts at every level are connected to a coarser level through a parent-child relationship (Fig. 1(b)-Horizontal). Parts are further grouped into part-types (e.g., left-facing head, long stretching arm, etc) so as to model appearance variations (Fig. 1(b)-Vertical). By having the ability to share appearance models of part types and by decomposing complex poses into parent-child pairwise relationships, APM strikes a good balance between model complexity and model richness. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiment results on public datasets show that APM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show results on PASCAL 2007 - cats and dogs - two highly challenging articulated object categories."

We extend existing techniques in several ways: real time prediction of multiple 3D joints, explicit learning of voting weights, vote compression to allow larger training sets, and a comparison of several decision-tree training objectives. Key aspects of our work include: regression directly from the raw depth image, without the use of an arbitrary intermediate representation; applicability to general motions (not constrained to particular activities) and the ability to localize occluded as well as visible body joints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces state of the art results on several data sets including the challenging MSRC-5000 pose estimation test set, at a speed of about 200 frames per second. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster."

We argue that this representation of parts is not necessarily appropriate for human parsing. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical poselets\u2013a new representation for human parsing. Hierarchical poselets can be rigid parts, but they can also be parts that cover large portions of human bodies (e.g. torso + left arm). In the extreme case, they can be the whole bodies. We develop a structured model to organize poselets in a hierarchical way and learn the model parameters in a max-margin framework. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach on two datasets with aggressive pose variations."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

While large, manually collected datasets exist, the captured variations w.r.t. appearance, shape and pose are often uncontrolled thus limiting the overall performance. In order to overcome this limitation we propose a new technique to extend an existing training set that allows to explicitly control pose and shape variations. For this we build on recent advances in computer graphics to generate samples with realistic appearance and background while modifying body shape and pose. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of articulated human detection and articulated pose estimation. We report close to state of the art results on the popular Image Parsing [25] human pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate superior performance for articulated human detection. In addition we define a new challenge of combined articulated human detection and pose estimation in real-world scenes."

There are two kinds of edges defined in the body part relation graph: Strong (tree) edges corresponding to the body plan that can enforce any type of constraint, and weak (non-tree) edges that express exclusion constraints arising from inter-part occlusion and symmetry conditions. We express optimal part localization as a multiple shortest path problem in a set of correlated trellises constructed from the graph model. Strong model edges generate the trellises, while weak model edges prohibit implausible poses by generating exclusion constraints among trellis nodes and edges. The optimization may be expressed as an integer linear program and solved using a novel two-stage relaxation scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method has a high chance of obtaining the globally optimal pose at low computational cost."

To achieve tractability, the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example, by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions. These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data. On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars."

Pose accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the part detectors but more accurate detectors are likely to be also more computationally expensive. We propose to use multiple, heterogeneous part detectors with varying accuracy and computation requirements, ordered in a hierarchy, to achieve more accurate and efficient pose estimation. For inference, we propose an algorithm to localize articulated objects by exploiting an ordered hierarchy of detectors with increasing accuracy. The inference uses branch and bound method to search for each part and use kinematics from neighboring parts to guide the branching behavior and compute bounds on the best part estimate. We demonstrate our approach on a publicly available People dataset and outperform the state-of-art methods. Our inference is 3 times faster than one based on using a single, highly accurate detector."

In this paper we develop a new algorithm for detecting people using poselets. Unlike that work which used 3D annotations of keypoints, we use only 2D annotations which are much easier for naive human annotators. The main algorithmic contribution is in how we use the pattern of poselet activations. Individual poselet activations are noisy, but considering the spatial context of each can provide vital disambiguating information, just as object detection can be improved by considering the detection scores of nearby objects in the scene. This can be done by training a two-layer feed-forward network with weights set using a max margin technique. The refined poselet activations are then clustered into mutually consistent hypotheses where consistency is based on empirically determined spatial keypoint distributions. Finally, bounding boxes are predicted for each person hypothesis and shape masks are aligned to edges in the image to provide a segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting system is the current best performer on the task of people detection and segmentation with an average precision of 47.8% and 40.5% respectively on PASCAL VOC 2009."

Conceptually, both of these problems can be addressed within the pictorial structures framework (Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher in Int. J. Comput. Vis. 61(1):55\u201379, 2005; Fischler and Elschlager in IEEE Trans. Comput. C-22(1):67\u201392, 1973), even though previous approaches have not shown such generality. A principal difficulty for such a general approach is to model the appearance of body parts. The model has to be discriminative enough to enable reliable detection in cluttered scenes and general enough to capture highly variable appearance. Therefore, as the first important component of our approach, we propose a discriminative appearance model based on densely sampled local descriptors and AdaBoost classifiers. Secondly, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model and compute marginal posteriors for each part using belief propagation. Thirdly, non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between the parts. Additionally, in order to cope with shortcomings of tree-based pictorial structures models, we augment our model with additional repulsive factors in order to discourage overcounting of image evidence. We demonstrate that the combination of these components within the pictorial structures framework results in a generic model that yields state-of-the-art performance for several datasets on a variety of tasks: people detection, upper body pose estimation, and full body pose estimation."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

Typical PS models assume an object can be represented by a set of rigid parts connected with pairwise constraints that define the prior probability of part configurations. These models are widely used to represent non-rigid articulated objects such as humans and animals despite the fact that such objects have parts that deform non-rigidly. Here we define a new Deformable Structures (DS) model that is a natural extension of previous PS models and that captures the non-rigid shape deformation of the parts. Each part in a DS model is represented by a low-dimensional shape deformation space and pairwise potentials between parts capture how the shape varies with pose and the shape of neighboring parts. A key advantage of such a model is that it more accurately models object boundaries. This enables image likelihood models that are more discriminative than previous PS likelihoods. This likelihood is learned using training imagery annotated using a DS \u201cpuppet.\u201d We focus on a human DS model learned from 2D projections of a realistic 3D human body model and use it to infer human poses in images using a form of non-parametric belief propagation."

The responses of this collection of detectors can then be used as a high-level image representation. In this work, we propose to go a step further in this direction by modeling spatial relations among different detector responses. We use Random Forests in order to discriminatively select spatial relations which represent frequent co-occurrences of detector responses. We demonstrate our idea in the specific people detection framework, which is a challenging classification task due to the variability of the human body articulations and appearance, and we use the recently proposed poselets as our basic object dictionary. The use of poselets is not the only possible, actually the proposed method can be applied more in general since few assumptions are made on the basic object detector. The results obtained show sharp improvements with respect to both the original poselet-based people detection method and to other state-of-the-art approaches on two difficult benchmark datasets."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

TGP captures not only the interdependencies between covariates, as in a typical GP, but also those between responses, so correlations among both inputs and outputs are accounted for. TGP is exemplified, with promising results, for the reconstruction of 3d human poses from monocular and multicamera video sequences in the recently introduced HumanEva benchmark, where we achieve 5\u00a0cm error on average per 3d marker for models trained jointly, using data from multiple people and multiple activities. The method is fast and automatic: it requires no hand-crafting of the initial pose, camera calibration parameters, or the availability of a 3d body model associated with human subjects used for training or testing."

While the detection of a specific rigid object under changing viewpoints was considered hard just a few years ago, current research strives to detect and recognize classes of non-rigid, articulated objects. Hampered by the omnipresent confusing information due to clutter and occlusion, the focus has shifted from holistic approaches for object detection to representations of individual object parts linked by structural information, along with richer contextual descriptions of object configurations. Along this line of research, we present a practicable and expandable probabilistic framework for parts-based object class representation, enabling the detection of rigid and articulated object classes in arbitrary views. We investigate learning of this representation from labelled training images and infer globally optimal solutions to the contextual MAP-detection problem, using A*-search with a novel lower-bound as admissible heuristic. An assessment of the inference performance of Belief-Propagation and Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation is obtained as a by-product. The generality of our approach is demonstrated on four different datasets utilizing domain dependent information cues."

Compared to previous Hough-based systems such as implicit shape models, Hough forests improve the performance of the generalized Hough transform for object detection on a categorical level. At the same time, their flexibility permits extensions of the Hough transform to new domains such as object tracking and action recognition. Hough forests can be regarded as task-adapted codebooks of local appearance that allow fast supervised training and fast matching at test time. They achieve high detection accuracy since the entries of such codebooks are optimized to cast Hough votes with small variance and since their efficiency permits dense sampling of local image patches or video cuboids during detection. The efficacy of Hough forests for a set of computer vision tasks is validated through experiments on a large set of publicly available benchmark data sets and comparisons with the state-of-the-art."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Here we propose conditional regression forest for this task. While regression forest learn the relations between facial image patches and the location of feature points from the entire set of faces, conditional regression forest learn the relations conditional to global face properties. In our experiments, we use the head pose as a global property and demonstrate that conditional regression forests outperform regression forests for facial feature detection. We have evaluated the method on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild [20] database where close-to-human accuracy is achieved while processing images in real-time."

This gives us the opportunity to write and optimize the core implementation only once, with application to many diverse tasks. \n \nThe proposed model may be used both in a discriminative or generative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labeled or unlabeled data. \n \nThe main contributions of this review are: (1) Proposing a unified, probabilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; (2) Demonstrating margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; (3) Discussing probabilistic regression forests in comparison with other nonlinear regression algorithms; (4) Introducing density forests for estimating probability density functions; (5) Proposing an efficient algorithm for sampling from a density forest; (6) Introducing manifold forests for nonlinear dimensionality reduction; (7) Proposing new algorithms for transductive learning and active learning. Finally, we discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general forest model. \n \nThis document is directed at both students who wish to learn the basics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in the new contributions. It presents both fundamental and novel concepts in a structured way, with many illustrative examples and real-world applications. Thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms such as support vector machines, boosting and Gaussian processes are presented and relative advantages and disadvantages discussed. The many synthetic examples and existing commercial applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and its flexibility."

Our approach considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance.\n\nThe core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension of the Generalized Hough Transform. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.\n\nAn extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the proposed system is applicable to a range of different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects. In addition, its flexible representation allows it to achieve competitive object detection performance already from training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable systems.\n"

This paper investigates the question of whether existing detectors will continue to improve as data grows, or if models are close to saturating due to limited model complexity and the Bayes risk associated with the feature spaces in which they operate. We focus on the popular paradigm of scanning-window templates defined on oriented gradient features, trained with discriminative classifiers. We investigate the performance of mixtures of templates as a function of the number of templates (complexity) and the amount of training data. We find that additional data does help, but only with correct regularization and treatment of noisy examples or \u201coutliers\u201d in the training data. Surprisingly, the performance of problem domain-agnostic mixture models appears to saturate quickly (\u223c10 templates and \u223c100 positive training examples per template). However, compositional mixtures (implemented via composed parts) give much better performance because they share parameters among templates, and can synthesize new templates not encountered during training. This suggests there is still room to improve performance with linear classifiers and the existing feature space by improved representations and learning algorithms."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression."

This is computationally challenging because the time complexity scales exponentially in the size of the largest clique in the graph. The proposed algorithm uses Branch and Bound (BB) to search for the globally optimal solution. The algorithm converges rapidly in practice and this is due to a novel method for quickly computing tree based lower bounds. The key idea is to recycle the dynamic programming (DP) tables associated with the tree model to look up the tree based lower bound rather than recomputing the lower bound from scratch. This technique is further sped up using Range Minimum Query data structures to provide O(1) cost for computing the lower bound for most iterations of the BB algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on the Iterative Parsing dataset and it is shown to run fast empirically."
