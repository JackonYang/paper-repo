We propose an algorithm which is capable of handling larger changes in viewpoint than classical correlation based techniques. Optimal performance for the algorithm is achieved for textured objects which are locally planar in at least one direction. The algorithm works by computing affinely invariant fourier features from intensity profiles in each image. The intensity profiles are extracted from the image data between randomly selected pairs of image interest points. Using a voting scheme, pairs of interest points are matched across images by comparing vectors of fourier features. Outliers among the matches are rejected in two stages, a fast stage using novel view consistency constraints, and a second, slower stage using RANSAC and fundamental matrix computation. In order to demonstrate the quality of the results, the algorithm is tested on several different image pairs."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

The new features are based on moments of powers of the intensities in the individual color bands and combinations thereof. These moments implicitly characterize the shape, the intensity and the color distribution of the pattern in a uniform manner. The paper gives a classification of all functions of such moments which are invariant under both affine deformations of the pattern (thus achieving viewpoint invariance) as well as linear changes of the intensity values of the color bands (hence, coping with changes in the irradiance pattern due to different lighting conditions and/or viewpoints). The discriminant power and classification performance of the new invariants for color pattern recognition is tested on a data set of images of outdoors advertising panels. A comparison to moment invariants presented in literature is included as well."

The method works by a comparison of sequences of recorded coordinates with a library of sequences from different individuals. The comparison is based on the evaluation of view invariant and calibration independent view consistency constraints. These constraints are functions of corresponding image coordinates in two views and are satisfied whenever the two views are projected from the same three-dimensional (3D) object. By evaluating the view consistency constraints for each pair of frames in a sequence of a walking person and a stored sequence, we obtain a matrix of consistency values that ideally are zero whenever the pair of images depict the same 3D posture. The method is virtually parameter free and computes a consistency residual between a pair of sequences that can be used as a distance for clustering and classification. Using interactively extracted data we present experimental results that are superior to those of previously published algorithms both in terms of performance and generality."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

Further investigations have shown the existence of quadlinear forms across four views with the negative result that further views would not add any new constraints [3, 12, 5]. We show in this paper first general results on any number of views. Rather than seeking new constraints (which we know now is not possible) we seek connections across trilinear tensors of triplets of views. Two main results are shown: (i) trilinear tensors across m>3 views are embedded in a low dimensional linear subspace, (ii) given two views, all the induced homography matrices are embedded in a four-dimensional linear subspace. The two results, separately and combined, offer new possibilities of handling the consistency across multiple views in a linear manner (via factorization), some of which are further detailed in this paper."

                "text": "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201cElementary Supernova\u201d model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric times in SN optical spectra."
