                "text": "1. Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

The filters used, known as Gabor filters, are optimal in several senses: they have tunable orientation bandwidths, they can be defined to operate over a range of spatial frequency channels, and they obey the uncertainty principle in two dimensions. The filters are interpreted as transforming the image into a modulated narrowband signal whose envelope coincides with the textured region to which the filter is tuned. Moreover, the receptive fields of neurons in the visual cortex are known to have shapes that approximate 2D Gabor filters, whose purpose has been uncertain. We suggest that they may play an important role in texture segmentation/surface perception. The technique is demonstrated using a variety of natural and synthetic textures."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We present quantitative results of theoretical studies on propagation of plane waves for normal incidence, through perfectly elastic multilayered media. As wavelet shapes, we use zero-phase cosine wavelets modulated by a Gaussian envelope and the corresponding complex wavelets. A finite set of such wavelets, for an appropriate sampling of the frequency domain, may be taken as the basic wavelets for a Gabor expansion of any signal or trace in a two-dimensional (2-D) domain (time and frequency). We can then compute the wave propagation using complex functions and thereby obtain quantitative results including energy and phase of the propagating signals. These results appear as complex 2-D functions of time and frequency, i.e., as \u201cinstantaneous frequency spectra. \u2019 \u2019 Choosing a constant sampling rate on the logarithmic scale in the frequency domain leads to an appropriate sampling method for phase preservation of the complex signals or traces. For this purpose, we developed a Gabor expansion involving basic wavelets with a constant time duration/mean period ratio. For layered media, as found in sedimentary basins,"

We illustrate the method by selecting two common topics in signal processing, prediction and system modelling, and show that nonlinear applications can be handled extremely well by using neural networks. The formalism is a natural, nonlinear extension of the linear Least Mean Squares algorithm commonly used in adaptive signal processing. Simulations are presented that document the additional performance achieved by using nonlinear neural networks. First, we demonstrate that the formalism may be used to predict points in a highly chaotic time series with orders of magnitude increase in accuracy over conventional methods including the Linear Predictive Method and the Gabor-Volterra-Weiner Polynomial Method. Deterministic chaos is thought to be involved in many physical situations including the onset of turbulence in fluids, chemical reactions and plasma physics. Secondly, we demonstrate the use of the formalism in nonlinear system modelling by providing a graphic example in which it is clear that the neural network has accurately modelled the nonlinear transfer function. It is interesting to note that the formalism provides explicit, analytic, global, approximations to the nonlinear maps underlying the various time series. Furthermore, the neural net more\u00a0\u00bb seems to be extremely parsimonious in its requirements for data points from the time series. We show that the neural net is able to perform well because it globally approximates the relevant maps by performing a kind of generalized mode decomposition of the maps. 24 refs., 13 figs. \u00ab\u00a0less"

We simulated the theoretical tools we present here, using the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm. Now we present sampling methods for complex signals or traces corresponding to received waves, and sampling methods for complex characterization of multilayered or heterogeneous media. Regarding the complex signals, we present a twodimecsional(2-D) method of sampling in the time-frequency domain using a special or \u201cextended\u201d Gabor expansion on a set of basic wavelets adapted to phase preservation. Such a 2-D expansion permits us to handle in a proper manner instantaneous frequency spectra. We show the differences between \u201cwavelet resolution\u201d and \u201csampling grid resolution.\u201d We also show the importance of phase preservation in high-resolution seismic. Regarding the media, we show how analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structured layers could help when trying to characterize the physical properties of the layers and their large scale granularity as a result of complex deconvolution. Analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structures are well known in solid state physics, and lead to the so-called \u201cBloch waves.\u201d The introduction of complex waves leads to replacing the classical wave equation by a Schriidinger equation. Finally, we show that complex wave equations, Gabor expansion, and Bloch waves are three different ways of \u2018introducing the tools of quantum mechanics in highresolution seismic (Gabor, 1946; Kittel, 1976, Morlet, 1975). And conversely, the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm and an extended Gabor expansion may be of some use in solid state physics."

Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals.

These properties concern the relationship between the organizational principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds."

This paper begins with an overview of how neural networks can be used to approximately implement such multidimensional matched filter banks. The nearest matched filter classifier is then formally defined. This definition is then reformulated to show that the classifier is equivalent to a nearest neighbor classifier in a separable infinite-dimensional metric space that specifies the local-in-time behavior of spatiotemporal patterns. The result of Cover and Hart is then applied to show that, given a statistically comprehensive set of filter templates, the nearest matched filter classifier will have near-Bayesian performance for spatiotemporal patterns. The combination of near-Bayesian classifier performance with the excellent performance of matched filtering in noise yields a powerful new classification technique. This result adds additional interest to Grossberg's hypothesis that the mammalian cerebral cortex carries out local-in-time nearest matched filter classification of both auditory and visual sensory inputs as an initial step in sensory pattern recognition-which may help explain the almost instantaneous pattern recognition capabilities of animals."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

The former results in the cross-Wigner distribution function (WD), and the latter results in the cross-ambiguity function (AF). When the persistent time of a sound emitter is more important than the characteristic tone of the sound emitter, WD will be more useful than AF for PAS activity detection, and vice versa. Their mutual relationships with the instantaneous power spectrum (IPS) show the importance of the phase information that must be kept in any 2-D representation of a 1 -D signal. If a square-law detector is used, or an unsymmetric version of WD or AF is gener-ated, then one must produce the other 2-D representations directly, rather than transform one to the other."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

The approach of studying two signals using their mutual 4D information pattern rather than by comparing their independent 2D patterns (e.g., Wigner patterns or ambiguity plots) offers a new and promising approach to a common and important problem. Because of symmetry, we can often show the 4D signal in 2D in a manner compatible with coherent optical real time display."
