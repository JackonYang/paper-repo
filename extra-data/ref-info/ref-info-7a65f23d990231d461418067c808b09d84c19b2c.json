It is time, Charniak observes, to switch paradigms. This text introduces statistical language processing techniques -- word tagging, parsing with probabilistic context free grammars, grammar induction, syntactic disambiguation, semantic word classes, word-sense disambiguation -- along with the underlying mathematics and chapter exercises. \nCharniak points out that as a method of attacking NLP problems, the statistical approach has several advantages. It is grounded in real text and therefore promises to produce usable results, and it offers an obvious way to approach learning: \"one simply gathers statistics.\" \nLanguage, Speech, and Communication"

Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBS are then discussed, comparing NLIDBS to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBS have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBS), and NLIDBS with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBS. The paper ends with reflections on the current state of the art."

From this point of view, texts that exist in two languages (bitexts) are the richest accessible source of linguistic knowledge. Such knowledge can be exploited in many ways, if it can be automatically acquired. The acquisition process is invariably based on automatic methods for inducing translational equivalence relations between the two halves of a bitext. At the word token level, these relations are called bitext maps; at the word type level, they are called translation models. This dissertation advances the state of the art in methods for determining both kinds of translational equivalence. It also shows how to integrate these methods to exploit a much wider variety of bitexts than was previously possible. \nThe dissertation begins by showing that the language-specific aspects of the bitext mapping problem can be encapsulated and modularized away, leaving only a problem of geometric pattern recognition. The best solution is then the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the search space and employs the fastest and most accurate search algorithm. The dissertation presents new methods for maximizing the signal strength, for filtering noise, and for searching the resulting scatterplot in linear expected space and time. The unprecedented accuracy of this solution enables a new application of bitext maps--automatic detection of omissions in translations. \nThe second half of the dissertation makes a number of advances in statistical translation modeling. First, it proves the feasibility of modeling translational equivalence independently of word order. Second, the dissertation shows why and how translation models can benefit from an explicit noise model. Third, it shows how the noise model can be conditioned on almost any kind of pre-existing language-specific knowledge, and that even simple linguistic clues can significantly improve translation model accuracy. Fourth, the dissertation shows how to automatically determine the sense inventories of words in bitext and how to automatically discover word sequences that are translated as a unit. This information enables translation models that account for polysemy and for phrasal translations."

                "text": "The corpus-based approach to linguistic analysis and language teaching has come to prominence over the past two decades. This book seeks to bring readers up to date with the latest developments in corpus-based language studies. In comparison with the existing introductory books in corpus linguistics, Corpus-based Language Studies is unique in a number of ways. First, this is a book which covers the 'how to' as well as the 'why'. In approaching 'how to', we obviously have to focus on specific concordance packages and corpora which are currently available. However, our aim is to embrace a range of corpora and packages, hence hopefully offsetting any problems due to corpora being withdrawn or software radically changed. It is the 'how to' focus which in large part makes this book stand out from other available volumes. This book includes six case studies, each exploring a particular research question using specific tools. This is where the reader learns how to do corpus linguistics, as the process of investigating the data using the package(s) concerned is spelt out step by step, using text and screenshots. Thus by the end of each case study, a corpus has been introduced, the reader has learnt how to use a retrieval package and some research questions have been explored. Readers are then encouraged to explore a related research question using the same corpus data, tools and techniques. As well as explaining 'how to', the book also addresses 'why'. While we may expect the reader to consult other books on corpus linguistics, we want this book, for two distinct reasons, to explore what one may do with corpus data and why one should want to do it. Firstly, and obviously, if we want the reader to be able to 'become' a corpus linguist having read the book, we clearly have to explain the rationale for corpus-based studies, and to use case studies both to exemplify the worth of corpus linguistics as well as the features of the packages concerned. Secondly, we want this book to tie in much more closely with linguistic theory than previous books in corpus linguistics have done. Our goal is to engage research questions and theory with corpus linguistics with an increasing depth and intensity as the book progresses. Second, this is a book which engages with a range of approaches to the use of corpus data, which makes it different from existing books in corpus linguistics, with each case study focusing on a major approach to the use of corpus data while paying little or no attention to other approaches. After reading this volume, readers are expected to understand when and how to combine these approaches with other methodologies. Finally, this is a book which is more focused on multilingual corpus linguistics than available corpus books. While this volume is concerned mainly with English corpus linguistics, we also cover issues in multilingual corpus linguistics, and have one case study focusing on a language other than English."

Online digital information extends far beyond the web and its publicly available information. Huge amounts of information are private and are of interest to local communities, such as the records of customers of a business. This information is overwhelmingly text and has its record-keeping purpose, but an automated analysis might be desirable to find patterns in the stored records. Analogous to this data mining is text mining, which also finds patterns and trends in information samples but which does so with far less structured--though with greater immediate utility for users--ingredients. This book focuses on the concepts and methods needed to expand horizons beyond structured, numeric data to automated mining of text samples. It introduces the new world of text mining and examines proven methods for various critical text-mining tasks, such as automated document indexing and information retrieval and search. New research areas are explored, such as information extraction and document summarization, that rely on evolving text-mining techniques."

The range of work to which statistical analysis is applicable is vast: including, for example, language acquisition, language variation and many aspects of applied linguistics. The authors give a wide variety of linguistic examples to demonstrate the use of statistics in summarising data in the most appropriate way, and then making helpful inferences from the processed information. The range of techniques introduced by the book will help the reader both to evaluate and make use of literature which employs statistical analysis, and to apply statistics in their own research. Each chapter gives step-by-step explanations of particular techniques using examples from a number of fields, and is followed by extensive exercises. The early part of the book provides a thorough grounding in probability and statistical inference, and then progresses through methods such as chi-squared and analysis of variance, to multivariate methods such as cluster analysis, principal components analysis and factor analysis. None of these techniques requires the reader to have a grasp of mathematics more complex than simple algebra. Students and researchers in many fields of linguistics will find this book an invaluable introduction to the use of statistics, and a practical text for the development of skills in the application of statistics."

Like the first edition its focus is on the development of precisely formulated grammars whose empirical predictions can be directly tested. There is also considerable emphasis on the prediction and evaluation of grammatical hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntactic hypotheses with matters of semantic analysis. The book covers the core areas of English syntax from the last quarter century, including complementation, control, \"raising constructions\", passives, the auxiliary system, and the analysis of long distance dependency constructions. \"Syntactic Theory's\" step-by-step introduction to a consistent grammar in these core areas is complemented by extensive problem sets drawing from a variety of languages. The book's theoretical perspective is presented in the context of current models of language processing, and the practical value of the constraint-based, lexicalist grammatical architecture proposed has already been demonstrated in computer language processing applications. This thoroughly reworked second edition includes revised and extended problems sets, updated analyses, additional examples and more detailed exposition throughout."

It begins with a discussion of the role that corpus linguistics plays in linguistic theory, demonstrating that corpora have proven to be very useful resources for linguists who believe that their theories and descriptions of English should be based on real rather than contrived data. Charles F. Meyer goes on to describe how to plan the creation of a corpus, how to collect and computerize data for inclusion in a corpus, how to annotate the data that are collected, and how to conduct a corpus analysis of a completed corpus. The book concludes with an overview of the challenges that corpus linguists face to make both the creation and analysis of corpora much easier undertakings than they currently are. Clearly organized and accessibly written, this book will appeal to students of linguistics and English language."

                "text": "Language research thrives on data collected from spontaneous interactions in naturally occurring situations. However, the process of collecting, transcribing, and analyzing naturalistic data can be extremely time-consuming and often unreliable. This book describes three basic tools for language analysis of transcript data by computer that have been developed in the context of the \"Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES)\" project. These are: the \"CHAT\" transcription and coding format, the \"CLAN\" package of analysis programs, and the \"CHILDES\" database. These tools have brought about significant changes in the way research is conducted in the child language field. They are being used with great success by researchers working with second language learning, adult conversational interactions, sociological content analyses, and language recovery in aphasia, as well as by students of child language development. The tools are widely applicable, although this book concentrates on their use in the child language field, believing that researchers from other areas can make the necessary analogies to their own topics. This thoroughly revised 2nd edition includes documentation on a dozen new computer programs that have been added to the basic system for transcript analysis. The most important of these new programs is the \"CHILDES\" Text Editor (CED) which can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including editing non-Roman orthographies, systematically adding codes to transcripts, checking the files for correct use of \"CHAT,\" and linking the files to digitized audio and videotape. In addition to information on the new computer programs, the manual documents changed the shape of the \"CHILDES/BIB\" system--given a major update in 1994--which now uses a new computer database system. The documentation for the \"CHILDES\" transcript database has been updated to include new information on old corpora and information on more than a dozen new corpora from many different languages. Finally, the system of \"CHAT\" notations for file transcript have been clarified to emphasize the ways in which the codes are used by particular \"CLAN\" programs. The new edition concludes with a discussion of new directions in transcript analysis and links between the \"CHILDES\" database and other developments in multimedia computing and global networking. It also includes complete references organized by research topic area for the more than 300 published articles that have made use of the \"CHILDES\" database and/or the \"CLAN\" programs. LEA also distributes the \"CLAN\" programs and the complete \"CHILDES\" Database--including corpora from several languages and discourse situations--described in \"The CHILDES Project.\" Be sure to choose the correct platform (IBM or Macintosh) for the \"CLAN\" programs; the \"CHILDES\" Database CD-ROM runs on both platforms."

                "text": "For those of us who belonged to the \"Bay Area (Computational) Linguistics Community,\" the early eighties were a heady time. Local researchers working on linguistics, computational linguistics, and logic programming were investigating notions of category, type, feature, term, and partial specification that appeared to converge to a powerful new approach for describing (linguistic) objects and their relationships by monotonic accumulation of constraints between their features. The seed notions had almost independently arisen in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. 1985), lexical-functional grammar (LFG) (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982), functionalunification grammar (FUG) (Kay 1985), logic programming (Colmerauer 1978, Pereira and Warren 1980), and terminological reasoning systems (Ait-Kaci 1984). It took, however, a lot of experimental and theoretical work to identify precisely what the core notions were, how particular systems related to the core notions, and what were the most illuminating mathematical accounts of that core. The development of the unificationbased formalism PATR-II (Shieber 1984) was an early step toward the definition of the core, but its mathematical analysis, and the clarification of the connections between the various systems, are only now coming to a reasonable closure. The Logic of Typed Feature Structures is the first monograph that brings all the main theoretical ideas into one place where they can be related and compared in a unified setting. Carpenter's book touches most of the crucial questions of the developments during the decade, provides proofs for central results, and reaches right up to the edge of current research in the field. These contributions alone make it an indispensable compendium for the researcher or graduate student working on constraint-based grammatical formalisms, and they also make it a very useful reference work for researchers in object-oriented databases and logic programming. Having discharged the main obligation of the reviewer of saying who should read the book under review and why, I will now survey each of the book's four parts while raising some more general questions impinging on the whole book as they arise from the discussion of each part."

It represents a major advance over previous grammars by virtue of drawing systematically on the linguistic research carried out on English during the last forty years. It incorporates insights from the theoretical literature but presents them in a way that is accessible to readers without formal training in linguistics. It is based on a sounder and more consistent descriptive framework than previous large-scale grammars, and includes much more explanation of grammatical terms and concepts, together with justification for the ways in which the analysis differs from traditional grammar. The book contains twenty chapters and a guide to further reading. Its usefulness is enhanced by diagrams of sentence structure, cross-references between sections, a comprehensive index, and user-friendly design and typography throughout."

This volume reprints forty-two articles on corpus linguistics by an international selection of authors, which comprehensively illustrate the directions in which the subject is developing. It includes articles that are already recognized as classics, and others which deserve to become so, supplemented with editorial introductions relating the individual contributions to the field as a whole.

Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning."

The use of A* search can dramatically reduce the time required to find a best parse by conservatively estimating the probabilities of parse completions. We discuss various estimates and give efficient algorithms for computing them. On average-length Penn treebank sentences, our most detailed estimate reduces the total number of edges processed to less than 3% of that required by exhaustive parsing, and a simpler estimate, which requires less than a minute of pre-computation, reduces the work to less than 5%. Un-like best-first and finite-beam methods for achieving this kind of speed-up, an A* method is guaranteed to find the most likely parse, not just an approximation. Our parser, which is simpler to implement than an upward-propagating best-first parser, is correct for a wide range of parser control strategies and maintains worst-case cubic time."

The first part of the book gives the reader a strong grounding in the way in which language teachers can use corpus analysis tools (wordlists, concordances, key words) to describe language patterns in general and text patterns in particular. The second section presents a series of case studies which show how a key word / corpus informed approach to language education can work in practice. The case studies include: General language education (i.e. students in national education systems and those following international examination programmes), foreign languages for academic purposes, literature in language education, business and professional communication, and cultural studies in language education."

As Japan is an island country in the Orient, and is located far from western countries, we have many exotic cultural aspects for everyone of you to enjoy. Our language is one of them, and I would like to explain a little bit about our language.In ancient Japan people had their language (they called it Yamato-kotoba), but had no characters. When they learned Chinese characters around the sixth century, they began to write by utilizing Chinese characters in two ways:1) For ideograms they borrowed Chinese characters of equivalent meaning but read the characters in their own ways.2) For about fifty phonetic signs they invented two kinds of Kana-characters.(a)Kata-kana: each kana is derived from an element of a corresponding Chinese character, (the pronunciation of it is needed for Japanese language).(b)Hira-kana: each kana is a result of simplification of a corresponding Chinese character written in a very cursive hand.Today, Kata-kana is ordinarily used for names and words of Western origin , and Hira-kana for everything else that is written phonetically. Nowadays we use about two thousand ideographic characters and about one hundred Kana characters in our daily life. Consequently if we want to process our texts by digital computers, our first problem is the choice of input/output devices for manipulating such many characters. In this preprint you will find many papers from Japanese colleagues that relate to this problem. And you will have opportunities to see such devices during your stay in Japan."

This book discusses the theory and practice of memory-based language processing, showing its comparative strengths over alternative methods of language modelling. Language is complex, with few generalizations, many sub-regularities and exceptions, and the advantage of memory-based language processing is that it does not abstract away from this valuable low-frequency information."

                "text": "Current textbooks in formal semantics are all versions of, or introductions to, the same paradigm in semantic theory: Montague Grammar. Knowledge of Meaning is based on different assumptions and a different history. It provides the only introduction to truth- theoretic semantics for natural languages, fully integrating semantic theory into the modern Chomskyan program in linguistic theory and connecting linguistic semantics to research elsewhere in cognitive psychology and philosophy. As such, it better fits into a modern graduate or undergraduate program in linguistics, cognitive science, or philosophy. Furthermore, since the technical tools it employs are much simpler to teach and to master, Knowledge of Meaning can be taught by someone who is not primarily a semanticist. Linguistic semantics cannot be studied as a stand-alone subject but only as part of cognitive psychology, the authors assert. It is the study of a particular human cognitive competence governing the meanings of words and phrases. Larson and Segal argue that speakers have unconscious knowledge of the semantic rules of their language, and they present concrete, empirically motivated proposals about a formal theory of this competence based on the work of Alfred Tarski and Donald Davidson. The theory is extended to a wide range of constructions occurring in natural language, including predicates, proper nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, quantifiers, definite descriptions, anaphoric expressions, clausal complements, and adverbs. Knowledge of Meaning gives equal weight to philosophical, empirical, and formal discussions. It addresses not only the empirical issues of linguistic semantics but also its fundamental conceptual questions, including the relation of truth to meaning and the methodology of semantic theorizing. Numerous exercises are included in the book."

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series"

                "text": "BackgroundThe goal of the first BioCreAtIvE challenge (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology) was to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for text mining applied to biological problems. The results were presented in a workshop held in Granada, Spain March 28\u201331, 2004. The articles collected in this BMC Bioinformatics supplement entitled \"A critical assessment of text mining methods in molecular biology\" describe the BioCreAtIvE tasks, systems, results and their independent evaluation.ResultsBioCreAtIvE focused on two tasks. The first dealt with extraction of gene or protein names from text, and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism databases (fly, mouse, yeast). The second task addressed issues of functional annotation, requiring systems to identify specific text passages that supported Gene Ontology annotations for specific proteins, given full text articles.ConclusionThe first BioCreAtIvE assessment achieved a high level of international participation (27 groups from 10 countries). The assessment provided state-of-the-art performance results for a basic task (gene name finding and normalization), where the best systems achieved a balanced 80% precision / recall or better, which potentially makes them suitable for real applications in biology. The results for the advanced task (functional annotation from free text) were significantly lower, demonstrating the current limitations of text-mining approaches where knowledge extrapolation and interpretation are required. In addition, an important contribution of BioCreAtIvE has been the creation and release of training and test data sets for both tasks. There are 22 articles in this special issue, including six that provide analyses of results or data quality for the data sets, including a novel inter-annotator consistency assessment for the test set used in task 2."

                "text": "The nature of the interplay between language learning and the evolution of a language over generational time is subtle. We can observe the learning of language by children and marvel at the phenomenon of language acquisition; the evolution of a language, however, is not so directly experienced. Language learning by children is robust and reliable, but it cannot be perfect or languages would never change -- and English, for example, would not have evolved from the language of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. In this book Partha Niyogi introduces a framework for analyzing the precise nature of the relationship between learning by the individual and evolution of the population. Learning is the mechanism by which language is transferred from old speakers to new. Niyogi shows that the evolution of language over time will depend upon the learning procedure -- that different learning algorithms may have different evolutionary consequences. He finds that the dynamics of language evolution are typically nonlinear, with bifurcations that can be seen as the natural explanatory construct for the dramatic patterns of change observed in historical linguistics. Niyogi investigates the roles of natural selection, communicative efficiency, and learning in the origin and evolution of language -- in particular, whether natural selection is necessary for the emergence of shared languages. Over the years, historical linguists have postulated several accounts of documented language change. Additionally, biologists have postulated accounts of the evolution of communication systems in the animal world. This book creates a mathematical and computational framework within which to embed those accounts, offering a research tool to aid analysis in an area in which data is often sparse and speculation often plentiful."

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change \n \n\u001cI found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!\u001d \n \n\u0014 Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled \n \n\u001cI would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics \n \n\u001cThe wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies\u0014tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.\u001d \n \n\u0014 John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design \n \n\u001cThis is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Eric Vought, Software Engineer \n \n\u001cMost modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant \n \n\u001cSince reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. \n \n\u001cI would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....\u001d \n \n\u0014 Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. \n \n\u001cIf I\u0019m putting together a project, it\u0019s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I\u0019d settle for people who\u0019ve read their book.\u001d \n \n\u0014 Ward Cunningham \n \nStraight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to \n \nFight software rot; \n \nAvoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; \n \nWrite flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; \n \nAvoid programming by coincidence; \n \nBullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; \n \nCapture real requirements; \n \nTest ruthlessly and effectively; \n \nDelight your users; \n \nBuild teams of pragmatic programmers; and \n \nMake your developments more precise with automation. \n \nWritten as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer."

It brings together many of the main ideas in modern statistics in one place. The book is suitable for students and researchers in statistics, computer science, data mining and machine learning. This book covers a much wider range of topics than a typical introductory text on mathematical statistics. It includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation, bootstrapping and classification, topics that are usually relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is assumed to know calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of probability and statistics is required. The text can be used at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level."

                "text": "Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs."

This growth is accompanied by an accelerated increase in the number of biomedical publications discussing the findings. In the last few years, there has been a lot of interest within the scientific community in literature-mining tools to help sort through this abundance of literature and find the nuggets of information most relevant and useful for specific analysis tasks. This paper provides a road map to the various literature-mining methods, both in general and within bioinformatics. It surveys the disciplines involved in unstructured-text analysis, categorizes current work in biomedical literature mining with respect to these disciplines, and provides examples of text analysis methods applied towards meeting some of the current challenges in bioinformatics."

The theory to be tested is that agents have a variety of strategies which they use in goM-directed dialogue for deciding what information to include, how to present it, how to construct references, and how to handle interactions. Agents choose strategies for each of these a.speets of the dialogue depending on the complexity of the current task, responses from the partner, and the task's importance; in general, agents try to minimize the collaborative effort spent on the task but still complete it satisfactorily. The software allows simulated agents to be constructed using any combination of strategies, showing how the strategies interact and allowing the decisions made in human dialogues about the same task to be modelled. Currently, the system works on a subset of the strategies found in Shadbolt [6], but a corpus of human dialogues is being studied to construct, an improved theory of dialogue strategies, and these strategies will be incorporated into later versions of the system."

Brent's method of root finding was replaced by Ridder's method, and the Fletcher-Reeves method of optimization was dropped in favor of the downhill simplex method. Each numerical method is explained in detail, and its shortcomings are pointed out. The examples that follow individual topics fall into two categories: hand computations that illustrate the inner workings of the method and small programs that show how the computer code is utilized in solving a problem. This second edition also includes more robust computer code with each method, which is available on the book Web site. This code is made simple and easy to understand by avoiding complex bookkeeping schemes, while maintaining the essential features of the method."

To explore this question, the author has built a `socioscope' to track the behavior of groups of humans in great detail and during long periods of time, What he finds is that an amazing amount of human behavior can be accurately modeled by considering only certain sorts of mimicry, non-linguistic social signals, and stimulus-response mechanisms.

In addition, it will play a crucial role in the science the 21st century, which will be dominated by biology and biochemistry, similar to the role of mathematics in the physical sciences of the 20th century. In this award-winning best-seller, the author and his co-author focus on the fundamentals of computer science, which revolve around the notion of the algorithm. They discuss the design of algorithms, and their efficiency and correctness, the inherent limitations of algorithms and computation, quantum algorithms, concurrency, large systems and artificial intelligence. Throughout, the authors, in their own words, stress the fundamental and robust nature of the science in a form that is virtually independent of the details of specific computers, languages and formalisms'. This version of the book is published to celebrate 25 years since its first edition, and in honor of the Alan M. Turing Centennial year. Turing was a true pioneer of computer science, whose work forms the underlying basis of much of this book."

The concept of style underlies the authorship attribution techniques that have been applied to tasks such as identifying which of several authors wrote a particular news article. In this paper, we explore whether the works of authors of classic literature can be correctly identified with either of two approaches to attribution, using a collection of 634 texts by 55 authors. Our results show that these methods can be highly accurate, with errors primarily for authors where it might be argued that style is lacking. And did Marlowe write the works of Shakespeare? Our preliminary evidence suggests not."

                "text": "'Greens' and the Communist Party and the Action Francaise in the Paris of the thirties ? Its rhetorical style produces a tedious book with too many sentences of the following type, and this is one chosen at random: 'The gladiator handling his net in the arena had more noble blood in his veins than all the senators assembled there, more even than the ruler himself who donated the games' (p. 37). Since he takes at face-value what is stated by Ovid, Seneca, and Juvenal, Auguet paints a lurid picture of the Roman spectator, thus assuring that the contents of his book are as sick as the title of the series to which it belongs. &**Homo Necans by Walter Burkert is a book intended for specialists in Greek religion and mythology. Its array of footnotes is formidable but justified because of the mass of comparative evidence and references collected there. Every page of the book demands close attention; although few, I imagine, will want to read Burkert through from cover to cover, constant reference to his discussion of particular cults and myths is likely. The first chapter considers the theory of sacrifice and ritual, while subsequent chapters deal with individual cults, myths, and festivals, including New Year festivals, the Anthesteria, and the rites at Eleusis. In ^Aristotle's School John Patrick Lynch studies the Lyceum as a teaching institution, considering the location of the Lyceum, its foundation, similarities and differences between the Lyceum and the Academy, and the legal status and the history of the Peripatetic School after Aristotle. This book represents an investigation, and as such cites the relevant evidence, literary, epigraphical, and archaeological, the Greek and Latin sources being translated. Its subject is not speculative philosophy but educational practice; especially valuable to the non-specialist is the discussion of the Lyceum in relation to the Academy, for there has been a tendency to study teaching within the Academy and then to assume an identical pattern at the other establishment. Longaccepted views are re-examined here and elsewhere, e.g. Wilamowitz's thesis that the philosophical schools were organized as religious brotherhoods, and the opinion that the Peripatetic School continued to function until the sixth century A.D., and their inadequacies are exposed. The result is a work whose material is of a wider interest than its title might suggest. John Ferguson's ^The Heritage of Hellenism presents, in the author's own words, a 'series of impressions' of the Hellenistic world, examining, among other things, philosophy, literature, art, religion, and learning during that period of time. The subject is complex, and Ferguson's treatment of his themes of necessity somewhat superficial and uneven. Tarn and Griffith offer much more in the way of detailed study, while those who prefer a less orthodox approach should be referred to Moses Hadas. The spread of non-linguistic Classics in the lower forms of schools will provide a ready market for a paperback reprint of C. E. Robinson's Everyday Life in Ancient Greece.* The style, contents, and illustrations of this book, however admirable they were when the book was first published forty years ago, are sadly dated today. Thus it opens with a list of dates which includes 'c. 1250. Greek-speaking Achaeans begin to arrive from north' and 'c. 900. Homeric Poems written down'; in the Conclusion we read 'a modern psychologist has declared that \"the average intelligence of the Athenian race was as much higher than our own as our own is higher than that of the African negro\" ' (p. 150), a sentiment as offensive as it is dubious. Was no revision of the text really possible ? p. WALCOT"

However, a theoretical analysis of the metric finds several problems: the metric penalizes false negatives more heavily than false positives, overpenalizes near misses, and is affected by variation in segment size distribution. We propose a simple modification to the Pk metric that remedies these problems. This new metriccalled Window Diffmoves a fixed-sized window across the text and penalizes the algorithm whenever the number of boundaries within the window does not match the true number of boundaries for that window of text."

                "text": "De afgelopen jaren zijn er tal van hervormingen in het stelsel van sociale zekerheid doorgevoerd. Bij de verzekering tegen het risico van arbeidsongeschiktheid is de Wet op de arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (WAO) omgevormd tot de Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen (WIA). De Werkloosheidswet (WW) is aangepast en de duur van de uitkering bij werkloosheid beperkt. De gemeenten zijn financieel verantwoordelijk gemaakt voor de bijstand. De fiscale ondersteuning van regelingen voor vervroegde uittreding is \u2013 met een ruime overgangsregeling \u2013 gestopt. De regelingen voor aanvullende pensioenen zijn versoberd. En ten slotte is een nieuwe levensloopregeling ingevoerd. Volgens sommigen is er na al deze hervormingen geen dringende noodzaak meer om het stelsel verder aan te passen. Het Coalitieakkoord uit februari 2007 stelt echter dat de veranderingen in de samenleving gevolgen hebben voor de bestaande systemen van de verzorgingsstaat. Het vervolgt met de constatering dat nieuwe arrangementen nodig zijn, die beantwoorden aan de dynamiek van deze en de komende tijd. In de literatuur worden voorstellen gedaan voor een nieuwe opzet van de sociale zekerheid. Wellicht het meest opvallend zijn de voorstellen om te komen tot (verplichte) individuele spaarsystemen in de sociale zekerheid. Individuele spaartegoeden zouden, al dan niet in aanvulling op een collectieve verzekering of voorziening, gebruikt kunnen worden voor de dekking van (een deel van) het werkloosheidsrisico en het risico van inkomensderving door andere oorzaken. Als belangrijk voordeel van dit alternatief wordt de efficiencywinst gezien: door gebruik te maken van individuele spaartegoeden kunnen individuen het inkomen op doelmatige wijze over de levensloop spreiden en worden de prikkels voor arbeidsdeelname versterkt. Bij non-participatie wordt immers ingeteerd op het spaartegoed en daarmee op toekomstig inkomen. De levensloopregeling zou kunnen worden gezien als een eerste stapje in een dergelijke richting. Tot nu toe kunnen spaartegoeden in de levensloopregeling worden gebruikt bij inkomensderving als gevolg van vormen van verlof. Het Coalitieakkoord kondigt echter een uitbreiding van de aanwendingsmogelijkheden van de regeling aan, waarbij ook het gebruik van de regeling om de periode tussen twee banen te overbruggen als mogelijkheid wordt genoemd. Dit kan moeilijk anders worden begrepen dan het gebruik van spaartegoeden om het werkloosheidsrisico (voor een deel) te dekken. Dit hoofdstuk bespreekt aan de hand van de beschikbare relevante literatuur de vooren nadelen van individuele spaarsystemen in de sociale zekerheid. Deze analyse kan leren of en in hoeverre spaarsystemen een kansrijke hervormingsoptie vormen en zo ja, voor welke"

In the summer, dust filled the inside of the coach, and those who chose to draw the curtains to shut it out had to bear the heat. In the winter, the rain and snow seeped in. Long waits for river ferries might occur. A trip out of Boston might begin as early as 3:00 am and stay on the road for seventeen hours and sixty miles. A short night would then be spent at a crowded inn with two or more to a bed. The next day was more of the same."
