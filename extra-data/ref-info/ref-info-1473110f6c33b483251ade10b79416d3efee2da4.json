The least squares estimators were studied by Gauss and by other authors later in the nineteenth century. A proof that the best unbiased estimator of a linear function of the means of a set of observed random variables is the least squares estimator was given by Markov [12], a modified version of whose proof is given by David and Neyman [4]. A slightly more general theorem is given by Aitken [1]. Fisher [5] indicated that for large samples the maximum likelihood estimator approximately minimizes the mean squared error when compared with other reasonable estimators. This paper will be concerned with optimum properties or failure of optimum properties of the natural estimator in certain special problems with the risk usually measured by the mean squared error or, in the case of several parameters, by a quadratic function of the estimators. We shall first mention some recent papers on this subject and then give some results, mostly unpublished, in greater detail."

In this paper we consider two such situations. (a) Regression analysis. The problem here is whether any variables can be discarded as adding little or nothing to the accuracy with which the regression equation correlates with the dependent variable. (b) Interdependence analysis. The problem is whether a constellation in p dimensions collapses, exactly or approximately, into fewer dimensions, and if so whether any of the original variables can be discarded. We may define the best solution to (a) using any given number of variables as the one that maximizes the multiple correlation between the selected variables and the dependent variable, and similarly for (b) as the one that maximizes the smallest multiple correlation with any of the rejected variables. In practice it is usual to accept an approximate solution to (a) based on 'step-wise' multiple regression: we know of no standard program for (b). We have developed cut-off rules that enable us to find the best solution to both problems by partial enumeration. The paper discusses the details of this approach, and computational experience."

If there are k independent variables, there are 2 k possible linear equations to be examined; one equation using none of the variables, k using one variable, k(k \u2013 1)/2 using two variables, etc. Often there are several equally good candidates. Selection depends on whether one needs a simple interpolation formula or estimates of the effects of individual independent variables. Fractional factorial designs for sampling the 2 k possibilities and a new statistic proposed by C. Mallows simplify the search for the best candidate. With the new statistic, regression equations can be compared graphically with respect to both bias and random error."

In many cases, authors have then gone on to devise new techniques to achieve the proposed objectives of principal component analysis. It is interesting that, in those cases in which authors have given the results of the principal component analysis in sufficient detail for the reader to be able to make an independent assessment of the success of the technique, the results of the analysis have been both clear and useful. One such example is the paper by Draper (1964) for which an interpretation was given by Jeffers (1965). That this situation should have arisen is not, of course, particularly surprising. Although principal component analysis, and indeed most other multivariate techniques, have been well described in a number of texts, the emphasis of these descriptions has been on the underlying theory of the methods and on the methods of computation. Only a limited number of practical examples of the technique have been published in sufficient detail to enable the reader to gain any facility in the interpretation of the results of the analysis, and the necessary background knowledge to the problems is not usually available. The interpretation of the results of the analysis is therefore left to the reader and no clear advice is given as to how this may best be done. One of the aims of this paper, therefore, is to suggest that there is a need for the extensive application of the present methods of multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis, over a wide range of problems and subjects, in order to test the practical value of the techniques. The theory of multivariate methods has far out-run the practical application of the techniques, with the result that only a handful of examples are available in the published literature. In part, some of this lack of practical examples has stemmed from difficulties in computation, but the greater availability of electronic digital computers has already removed this obstacle."

                "text": "In general, this book is concerned with capital budgeting and decision theory. Specifically, it centers around a singular uncertainty decision the decision by oil and gas operators to drill, or not to drill, a well. Actually, a sequence of decisions must precede this final action, but each one of these preliminary decisions is principally directed toward the final payoff question: Should we invest money in this well? If so, how much should we risk, and how much of the risk should we share with others? The objective of this book is twofold. The first objective is to describe the nature of decision problems in drilling for gas and oil, a business situation where uncertainties are exceptionally great, and to describe how businessmen actually make drilling decisions in the face of these uncertainties. This descriptive section, of great interest in its own right, then provides the foundation for the second objective, which is to explore the possibilities of applying \"decision theories\" to such decisions. This second objective is normative or prescriptive in its attempt to provide the driller with better guides to consistent action to meet his own goals. The presentation of the applications of mathematical theories is kept clear and simple, and the methods suggested for dealing with these problems can be understood by a reader with only a working knowledge of arithmetic and high school algebra. This book should be of interest to several audiences, among whom are the following: ( 1 ) people in the oil industry; (2) people in other industries who are actively interessed in finding ways of making better decisions in situations of risk and uncertainty; and (3) people whose interests are perhaps inore academic and who are concerned with both theory and practice in the area of decision making. xmlui.dri2xhtml.METS1.0.item-descriptionmiscellaneous 380 p., graph.

Of course, in linear regression the problem is much more difficult; the number of possibilities is so large. First, there is the number of parameters involved. To have ten to twenty regression coefficients is not uncommon. And their signs have to be considered. Then there is X\u2019X and the (z) different factor correlations and the ways in which they can be related. Yet in the final analysis these many different influences can be integrated to make an assessment as to whether the estimated values are consistent with the data and the properties of the data generator. Guiding one along the way, of course, is the objective of the study. In Hoer1 and Kennard (1970) it is shown for two problems how such an assessment can be made."
