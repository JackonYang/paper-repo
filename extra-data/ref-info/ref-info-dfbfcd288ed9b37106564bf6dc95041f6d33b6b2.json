                "text": "From a world history perspective, the most noticeable trend in the history of the late 19th century was the domination of Europeans over Non\u00adEuropeans. This domination took many forms ranging from economic penetration to outright annexation. No area of the globe, however remote from Europe, was free of European merchants, adventurers, explorers or western missionaries. Was colonialism good for either the imperialist or the peoples of the globe who found themselves subjects of one empire or another? A few decades ago, the answer would have been a resounding no. Now, in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the more or less widespread discrediting of Marxist and Leninist analysis, and the end of the Cold War, political scientists and historians seem willing to take a more positive look at Nineteenth Century Imperialism. One noted current historian, Niall Ferguson has argued that the British Empire probably accomplished more positive good for the world than the last generation of historians, poisoned by Marxism, could or would concede. Ferguson has argued that the British Empire was a \" liberal \" empire that upheld international law, kept the seas open and free, and ultimately benefited everyone by ensuring the free flow of trade. In other words, Ferguson would find little reason to contradict the young Winston Churchill's assertion that the aim of British imperialism was to: give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness from the soil, to place the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish their chances of pain. It should come as no surprise that Ferguson regards the United States current position in the world as the natural successor to the British Empire and that the greatest danger the U.S. represents is that the world will not get enough American Imperialism because U.S. leaders often have short attention spans and tend to pull back troops when intervention becomes unpopular. It will be very interesting to check back into the debate on Imperialism about ten years from now and see how Niall Ferguson's point of view has fared! The other great school of thought about Imperialism is, of course, Marxist. For example, Marxist historians like E.J. Hobsbawm argue that if we look at the l9th century as a great competition for the world's wealth and \u2026"

This is because illiquidity is prevalent world wide necessitating that effective and efficient management of any available cash will be needed to ensure that company breaks even and survives this distressed time since credit is not easily come by. This article presents empirical evidence of the effect of working capital management and liquidity on corporate profits using a cross- sectional time series data for the period 2005-2006. This micro-data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an OLS methodology. The authors find a positive effect of inventory conversion period (ICP), debtors collection period (DCP); and a negative effect of cash conversion period (CCP), creditors payment period (CPP), on return on assets (a mirror of corporate profitability). We discover that CCP with a wrong sign is the most significant precision variable in influencing profits and leads corporate profitability in Nigeria. It is closely followed by ICP and then CPP is third in importance in affecting profitability and liquidity in Nigeria. The paper therefore recommends (1) that firms should promptly collect cash from credit sales, (2) that excess cash should be reinvested in short-term securities (assets) to generate profits and (3) that since there exists high sales turnover in the Nigerian emerging markets, government policy should target multinational companies (MNCs) for invitation to participate in investing in Nigeria by creating the right legal and regulatory framework to enable them enter the market for possible FDI, IPI, and FPI injections into the Nigerian domestic economy."

                "text": "Working capital management efficiency plays a very significant and vital role in the performance of a manufacturing firm, where a major part of assets is composed of current assets. Therefore, the level of Working Capital must be properly determined and allocated to various segments, effectively controlled and regularly reviewed in order to have adequate and efficient flow of working capital. In this perspective, this paper analyzes working capital management performance of manufacturing sectors by using different working capital management measures which include Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), Net Trade Cycle (NTC), Receivable Turnover in Days (RTD), Inventory Turnover in Days (ITID), Payable Turnover in Days (PTD) and Return on Total Assets (ROTA). It also compares the ranking of sectors/industries based on working capital management performance in order to identify the prominent and laggard sectors. This study covers a period of 10 years from 1998 to 2007 for 204 manufacturing and trading firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange and classified in 24 sectors. In general the sectors which are leading on the basis of overall average results are also among the leading sectors throughout the study period. There is divergence among sectors over 1998-2007 in terms of working capital measures and corporate profitability. Sector-wise working capital management performance reveals that CCC and NTC, both comprehensive measures provide almost similar results. Oil & Gas Exploration and Refinery, Cement, Fertilizer and Oil and Gas Marketing sectors are on top based on both measures of working capital management. Above sectors are also among the leading sectors according to inventory turnover measure of working capital management performance. Similarly sectors which are laggard in terms of CCC and NTC are mainly due to inefficiency in ITID and RTD. Therefore, the laggard sectors must review their inventory and collection policy in order to be efficient in working capital management. There are few sectors which are although among the efficient sectors in terms of working capital but still among the laggard in terms of profitability such as Cement, Sugar and Vanaspati & Allied sectors. All Textile sectors are among the laggard sectors in terms of working capital management measures and ROTA. The cable and electric goods, Engineering and Pharmaceutical sectors are the laggard in terms of CCC because of problems and inefficiency with their inventory and collection policy. Dominant and laggard sectors in terms of working capital performance are mainly attributed to their inventory turnover in days. In most cases, the CCC and NTC is driven by the inventory turnover of the firm."

The participants were primarily European-American children who spoke English as a primary language (nine children were bilingual), and were from middle income socioeconomic backgrounds. There were 20 girls and 33 boys. Ages ranged from 3.11 to 6.60 years with a mean age of 4.66 years. On separate occasions, children individually completed the Goodenough-Harris Draw-a-Person Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-IV. We also recorded the children's social play using Howes and Matheson's [1992. Sequences in the development of competent play with peers: Social and social pretend play. Developmental Psychology, 28, 961\u2013974] scale. We employed a time sampling approach and also notated the area in which the child was playing. We found that gender and school setting influenced children's language abilities and social play. For example, children in the preschool that engaged in pretend play with greater frequency performed well on the receptive vocabulary test. We also found that certain classroom areas generated different types of social play. We discuss the applied value of our findings as these relate to future research."

Working capital management is considered to be a vital issue in financial management decision and it has its effect on liquidity as well as on profitability of the firm. Moreover, an optimal working capital management positively contributes in creating firm value. In this study, we have selected a sample of 10 FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) companies in India from CMIE database covering a period of 10 years from 2000\u201301 to 2009\u201310. Profitability has been measured in terms of return on assets (ROA).Cash conversion cycle (CCC), interest coverage ratio, age of inventory, age of creditors, age of debtors and debt-equity ratio have been used as explanatory variables. Pearson\u2019s correlation and pooled ordinary least squares regression analysis are used in the study. The study results confirm that there is a strong negative relationship between variables of the working capital management and profitability of the firm. As the CCC increases, profitability of the firm decreases, and managers can create a positive value for the shareholders by reducing the CCC to a possible minimum level. There is also a stumpy negative relationship between debt used by the firm and its profitability."

A random effects model was estimated using company financial data for the period 2010 -2012. These data were obtained from the Central African Stock Exchanges Handbooks. Thirty two companies listed on the Zimbabwe Stock exchange had usable data and therefore the random effects model was estimated using data from 32 non-financial companies listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The regression results show that profitability was not associated with receivables collection period, inventory conversion period, cash conversion cycle, quick ratio, current asset to total asset ratio, current liabilities to total asset ratio, debt ratio and age of company. However, a negative and significant relationship between payables deferral period and profitability was found. In addition, liquidity and size were found to enhance profitability of firms. Therefore Zimbabwean firms should pay more attention to the management of liquidity and payables."

This is important if the soil is being used to retain water such as would be required for an earth dam. \u2022 Compaction can prevent the build up of large water pressures that cause soil to liquefy during earthquakes. \u2022 Water content of the soil \u2022 The type of soil being compacted \u2022 The amount of compactive energy used 3.3 Laboratory Compaction tests There are several types of test which can be used to study the compactive properties of soils. Because of the importance of compaction in most earth works standard procedures have been developed. These generally involve compacting soil into a mould at various moisture contents. Soil is compacted into a mould in 3-5 equal layers, each layer receiving 25 blows of a hammer of standard weight. The apparatus is shown in Figure 1 below. The energy (compactive effort) supplied in this test is 595 kJ/m 3. The important dimensions are Volume of mould Hammer mass Drop of hammer 1000 cm 3 2.5 kg 300 mm Because of the benefits from compaction, contractors have built larger and heavier machines to increase the amount of compaction of the soil. It was found that the Standard Compaction test could not reproduce the densities measured in the field and this led to the development of the Modified Compaction test."

The effect of different variables of working capital management have been studied including the Average collection period, Inventory turnover in days, Average payment period and Net Trade Cycle on the return of assets for Jordanian companies. The problem statement to be analyzed in this study is:Does working capital management affect profitability of Jordanian companies? Many parties will benefit from this research like creditors and investorsin making theirs investment decisions and the researchers in explaining market variables and the managers in focusing on liquidity. The study sample consists of 39 companies for the 8 years period from 2004-2011. Applying correlations and multiple regression analysis, the result shows that there are significant negative associations between working capital variables with firm's profitability so it highlights the importance of managing working capital to improve firm's profitability.Yet recommendations basedon findings are offered to improve certain factors like the Industrial Jordanian Companies must set a trade-off between profitability and liquidity so that neither the liquidity nor profitability suffers, managing working capital in more efficient ways,enhancing the audit report by adding a liquidity position paragraph, and develop models that increase the detecting liquidity problem ability."

The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between working capital management and financial performance of listed manufacturing firms in Sri Lanka. A sample of 30 manufacturing firms listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange was used for this study. Data were collected from annual reports of sampled firms for the period of 2008 to 2011. Performance was measured in terms of return on assets and return on equity while cash conversion cycle, current assets to total assets and current liabilities to total assets were used as measures of working capital management. Correlation and regression analysis were used for the analysis. The findings reveal that, there is no significant relationship between cash conversion cycle and performance measures. The study also concludes that, manufacturing firms in Sri Lanka follow conservative working capital management policy. Key words: Working Capital Management, Performance, Cash Conversion Cycle."

The objective of this study is to re-evaluate the performative nature of three poems from two collections by Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali written at the height of the anti-apartheid fight in Soweto, South Africa. This will be viewed alongside Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2019s postcolonial critique that sees art and literature on either side of the hegemonic divide as a commentary on the social and cultural situation. Zulu traditions of dance, praise-poem, storytelling and folklore are explored in their relation to Mtshali\u2019s poetry. The analysis focuses on Mtshali\u2019s poetry from 1970s Soweto as his work from this period is inherently performative. It is established that due to political restrictions found in hegemony the subaltern South African poet uses both traditional and modern forms to create work that is performed and acts as a political tool. Postcolonial terminology and Spivak\u2019s critique make for specific analysis of the links between tradition and modernity. The postcolonial condition expressed by Spivak present in Mtshali\u2019s poetry reinforces her idea that artists comment in their work on the surroundings that affect them. Analysis of each of the poems shows they have characteristics of Zulu performative tradition; from echoing the style of poetic verse seen in the traditional tale of Nomabhadi to similarities with dance formations and the way that language is built up to encourage participation."

We used a sample of 131 companies listed in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) for the period of 2001-2004. The purpose of this paper is to establish a relationship that is statistically significant between profitability, the cash conversion cycle and its components for listed firms in the ASE. The results of our research showed that there is statistical significance between profitability, measured through gross operating profit, and the cash conversion cycle. Moreover managers can create profits for their companies by handling correctly the cash conversion cycle and keeping each different component (accounts receivables, accounts payables, inventory) to an optimum level."

The panel data regression analysis is employed using financial reports of 47 SMEs of North-West geopolitical zone in Nigerian for the period 2008\u20132012. The study found a statistically significant relationship between account receivables period, accounts payable period, cash conversion efficiency and board size with SMEs profitability, proxy by gross operating profits. Further, a positive relationship between inventory holding periods, cash conversion cycle and cash ratio with profitability were established. The result suggest that SMEs owners/managers need to give more emphasis to efficient management of their limited resources by managing their account receivables, accounts payable, inventories and cash effectively for improve profitability. In addition, the study contributes to existing literatures on the importance of WCM and board size to SMEs for sustainability and growth.

Although intensive care medicine has developed rapidly over the years, there exists, still, little scientific evidence as to what treatments and practices are effective. Moreover, intensive care faces economic challenges, which increase the need to provide evidence not only for effectiveness but also for efficiency of the delivered care. Intensive care is, moreover, a complex process, which is carried out on a very heterogeneous population and is influenced by several variables that include such hardly quantifiable items such as the cultural background or different healthcare systems. It is, therefore, extremely difficult to reduce the quality of intensive care to something measurable, to quantify it and then to compare it between different institutions."

Utilizing unbalanced data for a sample of 49 Jordanian Industrial corporations listed at Amman Stock Exchange - 2005 to 2009. Using two alternative measures of profitability as proxy for the performance and five proxies for the Working Capital Management, estimation of twenty models panel data cross-sectional time series have been tested employing two regression models; the Fixed-Effects Model and the Ordinary Least Squares Model. The findings of our study found to be significantly consistent with the view of the traditional working capital theory. The results suggest that working capital management and performance are positively correlated. The regression results also concluded that the Jordanian industrial firms follow a conservative investing policy and less aggressive financing policy in the working capital, and a well-efficient managing of the working capital can add value to the shareholders wealth."

This study investigated the effect working capital management on profitability, using fifteen South African SMMEs, listed on the Alt-X on the JSE, from 2008-2012, using a multiple regression analysis. The results show a positive relationship between number of days account receivable, number of day\u2019s inventory and negative relationship between number of days payable and cash convention cycle.

The study used panel data methodology within the framework of the random effects technique for the presentation and analysis of findings. Contrary to most previous empirical works, cash operating cycle has a significantly positive relationship with bank profitability, just like debtors\u2019 collection period, whiles creditors\u2019 payment period exhibits a significantly opposite relationship with profitability. Also, credit risk, exchange risk, capital structure and size significantly increase bank profitability. Surprisingly, however listed banks appear to perform poorly as compared to unlisted banks. The revelations in this paper go to inform bank directors and policy makers on the direction of managing bank working capital."

Moreover, most of the literature have identified that optimal working capital management positively contributes to the firm value. This study based on the data during 20082012 on listed manufacturing companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange investigated the effect of working capital management on profitability. The findings suggest that the profitability is negatively associated with the account receivable period, inventory turnover period, and cash conversion cycle. Further, it was found that the profitability is positively associated with account payable period. Moreover, the evidence suggests that increase in leverage leads to decline in the profitability. Therefore, the findings of paper reveal that manufacturing companies can boost their performance in terms of profitability by managing working capital appropriately."

Using a dataset of all Indonesian firms over the period 1998-2010, results show that the Cash Conversion Cycle and Net Trade Cycle are positively associated with the firms profitability. Results also show that firms riskiness, as measured by the debt ratio, is negatively related to the firms Return on Assets. The results of this study should be of interest to executives and major stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and financial analysts, especially after the recent global financial crisis and the latest collapses of giant organizations worldwide."

Trade credit policy and inventory policy are measured by number of days accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, and the cash conversion cycle is used as a comprehensice measure of working capital management. The results suggest that managers can increase corporate profitablity by reducing the number of days accounts receivable and inventories. Less profitable firms wait longer to pay their bills.

What is not clear is how Australian teachers nurture this aspect of thinking and learning when children enter formal schooling. The aim of this study was to investigate the pedagogies employed by teachers reputed to be exemplary practitioners to foster 5-8 year old children\u2019s imagination and creativity. This study used descriptive case study to explore the thinking, actions and insights of three teachers in different settings. Data were collected using non-participant observation and video recording of classroom interactions; and a video-stimulated review interview process. Analysis revealed four common pedagogies that fostered imagination and creativity across the curriculum. They were: supporting children to direct their own learning through play; listening to children; provoking children\u2019s thinking and emotions; and tolerance of ambiguity and mistakes. The findings demonstrated that teachers in the early years of school can successfully use pedagogies that engage children\u2019s imagination and creativity, within the perceived constraints of curriculum, timetabling and space. Future research into this topic could investigate children\u2019s responses to these pedagogies."
