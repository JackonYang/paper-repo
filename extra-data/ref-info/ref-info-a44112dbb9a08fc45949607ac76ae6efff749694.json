Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

Its major application, to date, has been to the interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application, features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with the interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained. At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature. One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. The rules are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted."

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."

This paper describes a compromise approach: measure the features on small subimages, and smooth the resulting feature values in such a way that neighboring subimages that belong to differently textured regions are unlikely to influence one another. When this is done, classification performance improves substantially. Improvement is also obtained when the subimages are classified probabilistically and relaxation is used to adjust the class probabilities. The problem of choosing a window size that minimizes overall misclassification probability is also discussed."

In the first method, the correct gray level of a point P is estimated by a weighted average of the gray levels of P's immediate neighbors. To assign these weights for a given P so that the local averaging operation does not blur the image, the presence of any edges or lines passing through P's neighborhood must be determined. For example, when an edge is present, only those points on P's side of the edge should be used. In general, the distribution of gray levels in P's neighborhood will suggest many possible line and edge configurations which can be used to compute the weight distribution for the averaging operation. The averaging is performed in parallel over the entire image and is iterated for additional smoothing. The second method is a relaxation labeling formulation which can be psed in cases of more severe noise. Each point is now assigned a vector of probabilities over its allowable gray level set. These probabilities are updated as weighted averages of the gray level probabilities at neighboring points. Once again the presence of lines and edges determines how the contribution from each neighboring point is weighted. Examples demonstrating both methods are given."

A relaxation process can be used to reduce these errors; we classify the pixels probabilistically, and then adjust the probabilities for each pixel, based on its neighbors' probabilities, with light reinforcing light and dark dark. When this adjustment process is iterated, the dark probabilities become very high for pixels that belong to dark regions, and vice versa, so that thresholding becomes trivial."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

This paper introduces a new perspective toward relaxation-that of considering it as a process for reordering labels attached to nodes in a graph. This new perspective is used to establish the formal equivalence between relaxation and another widely used algorithm, local maxima selection. The equivalence specifies conditions under which a family of cooperative relaxation algorithms, which generalize the well-known ones, decompose into purely local ones. Since these conditions are also sufficient for guaranteeing the convergence of relaxation processes, they serve as stopping criteria. We feel that equivalences such as these are necessary for the proper application of relaxation and maxima selection in complex speech and vision understanding systems."

The values are then iteratively adjusted, and the probabilities are reinforced or weakened, in a manner dependent on the values and probabilities at neighboring points. For example, a point p's probability of being on a side is reinforced if p and its neighbors have similar slopes, and our estimate of p's slope can be improved by (say) averaging with these slopes. Similarly, p's probability of being an angle is reinforced if appropriate slope or curvature differences exist between p and its neighbors, and our estimate of p's curvature can be improved by taking the neighbors' slopes into account. A set of such reinforcement and adjustment rules is formulated, and examples are given of their effects on various types of shapes."

We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations, graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems, are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally, we define the \u00bfKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes, as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."
