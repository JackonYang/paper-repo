The measurement sequence selection is accomplished by threshold tests based on the innovations sequence and state estimates of each filter. Numerical experiments performed using the algorithm illustrate how the accuracy of the a priori state estimates and trajectory model influences the selectivity of the algorithm."

The maximum likelihood estimator is given in a form that lends itself to sequential computations performed in real time as the data arrives. Examples of the use of this estimator make clear the precise mathematical meaning of such terms as tentative, confirmed, and established data tracks, and the concept of search areas. The analytical technique is of general use in a variety of surveillance situations. Computer implementations are possible."

In spite of many serious mechanical perception of microscopic fields with a reliability that would inspire routine application still eludes us. Many facets of the problem appear to be well within the grasp of presentday technology. Thus, available histochemical techniques make it possible to prepare biological materials so that morphological integrity is preserved, key constituents are stained stoichiometrically, and the specimens are favorably dispersed for effective imaging one by one. Scanning microscopes now have the requisite sensitivity, resolution, and stability to sample such objects and make photometric measurements over a wide range of magnifications and wavelengths within the visible and near-visible spectrum. Furthermore, modern large capacity, high speed data facilities at last provide the ability to manipulate the hitherto unmanageable quantities of optical information contained within all but the simplest images. With the basic materials for achieving automation via mensuration finally a t hand, attention has been turned toward generating and evaluating methods for extracting meaning from quantitative optical information. Definitive concepts for image structuring and image characterization have yet to be realized, to be given satisfactory operational definitions, and to be assembled within a machine-oriented perceptual framework.6 Criteria for effective and efficient discrimination and interpretation of images must be evolved. It would be a serious mistake to presuppose that mechanical perception must mimic the human\u2019s perceptual apparatus in organizing images as complexes of picture eIements. Likewise i t would be serious to ignore traditional descriptive morphology and established taxonomies. In steering a middle course, the exploration of many complementary approaches and the introduction of numeric methods which fully utilize measurements of light intensity of optical density seemed to us to hold the most promise for augmenting and explicating the existing, largely verbal tradition of microscopic morphology. To realize these objectives, we have designed a system with three basic components: 1) a sensor which rigorously and effectively scans microscopic fields and converts the optical information into digital form; 2) human analysts who contribute heuristics, devise image processing methods and en-"

The  concluding  chapter of the  book  presents  various timing circuits for monostable and astable multivibrators. Timing circuit operation is illustrated for CMOS, ECL, and TZL gates, and for use with the 555 timer. In evaluating this bo.ok a s a course textbook or for self study, this reviewer gives it very high marks. The explanations are clear and well illustrated with example calculations and problems. There are more than 400 homework problems provided, and a solution manual and an answer book are also available to instructors. Also, the authors state in the Preface that they\"wil1 be happy to furnish a set of laboratory experiments currently used at CCNY (City College of the City University of New York) in conjunction with this text.\" In summary, the combination of'the topical content and the clarity of explanation in this book when mixed with proven technical writing successes of the authors over the last 30 years assures this reviewer that this volume will become a well-recognized text for practical engineering in digital integrated electronics."
