The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

                "text": "In a series of experiments, the extrinsic afferent pathways to the somatic sensory areas have been selectively interrupted and the distribution and mode of termination of degenerating synaptic endings studied at intervals of 2 to 6 days. Degenerating commissural fibres terminate on spines attached to dendrites of medium and small size in all cortical layers, but the endings are concentrated in the deeper parts of layers I and III and in layer IV. Cortical association fibres passing from SII to SI end on spines of small and medium-sized dendrites mainly in the intermediate layers (III, IV and V) of the cortex, but a small number are invariably seen in the molecular layer. Some of the latter are probably derived from thin myelinated axons which spread radially from a lesion and run just beneath the pia mater. Degenerating thalamo-cortical axons terminate on spines and to a lesser extent on shafts of dendrites of small diameter, mainly in layer IV but with overlap into adjacent parts of layers III and V and with an additional small but consistent number ending in the molecular layer. Thus, the molecular layer and layer IV receive the terminations of all extrinsic afferents, while the relations of these to the other laminae and their mode of termination is, in each case, slightly different. One interpretation of the results is that all three sets of extrinsic afferents terminate in the middle portion of the apical dendritic tree of pyramidal neurons, and that thalamo-cortical fibres have additional terminals on stellate neurons. The functional implications of this arrangement are discussed."
