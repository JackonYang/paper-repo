The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The recognition is based on the characteristic motion of the legs of a pedestrian walking parallel to the image plane. Each image is segmented into region-like image parts by clustering pixels in a combined color/position feature space. The proposed clustering technique implies matching of corresponding clusters in consecutive frames and therefore allows clusters to be tracked over a sequence of images. Based on the observation of clusters over time a two-stage classifier extracts those clusters which most likely represent the legs of pedestrians. A fast polynomial classifier performs a rough preselection of clusters by evaluating temporal changes of a shape-dependent clusters feature. The final classification is done by a time delay neural network (TDNN) with spatio-temporal receptive fields."

Both algorithms are cooperating together in an optimal way, and with this cooperative feedback, the proposed approach even makes the tracking of persons possible in the presence of background motions, for instance caused by moving objects such as cars, or by camera operations as, for example, panning or zooming. We consider this as major advantage compared to most other tracking algorithms that are mostly not capable of dealing with background motion. Furthermore, the person to be tracked is not required to wear special equipment (e.g. sensors) or special clothing. We therefore believe that our proposed algorithm is among the first approaches capable of handling such a complex tracking problem. Our results are confirmed by several tracking examples in real scenarios, shown at the end of the paper and provided on the web server of our institute."

There is significant overhead needed in the development of such systems as well as the a priori assumption that the object dynamics can be described with such a dynamical model. This paper describes a new pattern classification technique for object detection in video sequences that uses a rich, overcomplete dictionary of wavelet features to describe an object class. Unlike previous work where a small subset of features was selected from the dictionary, this system does no feature selection and learns the model in the full 1,326 dimensional feature space. Comparisons using different sized sets of several types of features are given. We extend this representation into the time domain without assuming any explicit model of dynamics. This data driven approach produces a model of the physical structure and short-time dynamical characteristics of people from a training set of examples; no assumptions are made about the motion of people, just that short sequences characterize their dynamics sufficiently for the purposes of detection. One of the main benefits of this approach is that transient false positives are reduced. This technique compares favorably with the static detection approach and could be applied to other object classes. We also present a real-time version of one of our static people detection systems."

This paper demonstrates how dynamic filtering can be used in combination with a modal-based flexible shape model to track an articulated non-rigid body in motion. The results show the method being used to track the silhouette of a walking pedestrian in real time. The active shape model used was generated automatically from real image data and incorporates variability in shape due to orientation as well as object flexibility. A Kalman filter is used to control spatial scale for feature search over successive frames. Iterative refinement allows accurate contour localisation where feasible. The shape model incorporates knowledge of the likely shape of the contour and speeds up tracking by reducing the number of system parameters. A further increase in speed is obtained by filtering the shape parameters independently.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

A major difficulty with these methods is acquiring and trading the requisite feature points, which are generally specific joints such as knees or angles. This requires previous recognition and/or part segmentation of the actor. We show that the recognition of walking or any repetitive motion activity can be accomplished on the basis of bottom up processing, which does not require the prior identification of specific parts, or classification of the actor. In particular, we demonstrate that repetitive motion is such a strong cue, that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatiotemporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal gray-scale image sequences.<<ETX>>"

Correspondence is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the camera model until the appearances of the landmarks optimally match a symbolic description extracted from the image. \n \nThe matching of image and map features is performed rapidly by a new technique, called \"chamfer matching\", that compares the shapes of two collections of shape fragments, at a cost proportional to linear dimension, rather than area. These two techniques permit the matching of spatially extensive features on the basis of shape, which reduces the risk of ambiguous matches and the dependence on viewing conditions inherent in conventional image based correlation matching."

The selected candidates are either searched objects (e.g. different traffic signs) or known garbage patterns (e.g. other round objects) or also arbitrary patterns never seen before, since the closed world assumption generally made in classification theory is often violated in practice. Our aim is to keep the false positive rate as low as possible, allowing for a rather high fraction of missed relevant objects. We present two classification approaches, one is a local approximator, namely an RBF network, the other one is a polynomial classifier using global approximation. The RBF net is adapted by bootstrapping and uses dimensionality reduction to yield fast classification cycles. The polynomial classifier is adapted by balancing the classes via moment matrices and uses a reject criterion in the decision space. For real-time traffic sign recognition we achieve a false positive rate of less than 0.5 percent at a rate of 5 percent of traffic signs rejected as garbage, which is tolerable since the overall decision is not made frame per frame but for the whole sequence while passing a traffic sign."

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

Regularization theory and a theoretical framework for approximation (based on regularization techniques) that leads to a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks are discussed. Regularization networks are mathematically related to the radial basis functions, mainly used for strict interpolation tasks. Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction. Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >"
