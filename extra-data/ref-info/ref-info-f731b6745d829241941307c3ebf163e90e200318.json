The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"

Each model consists of a flexible shape template, describing how important points of the object can vary, and a statistical model of the expected grey levels in regions around each model point. The shape models are parameterised in such a way as to allow \u2018legal\u2019 configurations. Such models have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. We describe how the models can be used in local image search and give examples of their application to medical images.

A local optimisation technique, developed for use with PDMs, has been incorporated into the GA search with the aim of improving the speed of convergence and optimality of solution.

The model considers an object undergoing an elastic deformation as a set of masses linked by springs, where the natural length of the springs is set equal to zero and is replaced by a set of constant equilibrium forces, which characterize the shape of the elastic structure in the absence of external forces. This model has the extremely nice property of yielding dynamic equations which are linear and decoupled for each coordinate, irrespective of the amplitude of the deformation. It provides a reduced algorithmic complexity, and a sound framework for modal analysis, which allows a compact representation of a general deformation by a reduced number of parameters. The power of the approach to segment, track and analyze 2-D and 3-D images is demonstrated by a set of experimental results on various complex medical images.<<ETX>>"

We describe a model-based approach which allows robust and accurate interpretation using explicit anatomical knowledge. Our method is based on the extension to 3D of Point Distribution Models (PDMs) and associated image search algorithms. A combination of global, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and local, Active Shape Model (ASM), search is used. We have built a 3D PDM of the human brain describing a number of major structures. Using this model we have obtained automatic interpretations for 30 3D Magnetic Resonance head images from different individuals. The results have been evaluated quantitatively and support our claim of robust and accurate interpretation."

Given a sufficient number of independent measurements, the solution is overconstrained and unique except for rotational symmetries. The proposed approach is based on the finite element method (FEM) and parametric solid modeling using implicit functions. This approach provides both the convenience of parametric modeling and the expressiveness of the physically based mesh formulation and, in addition, can provide great accuracy at physical simulation. A physically based object-recognition method that allows simple, closed-form comparisons of recovered 3-D solid models is presented. The performance of these methods is evaluated using both synthetic range data with various signal-to-noise ratios and using laser rangefinder data. >"

Collectively these may be regarded asm configurations, or scalings, each ofn points inp-dimensions. The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling them configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion \u03a3i=1m \u03a3i=1n \u03942(Pj(i)Gi), whereGi is the centroid of them pointsPi(i) (i = 1, 2, ...,m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special casem = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed."
