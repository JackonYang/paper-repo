This paper shows how dataflow properties can be analyzed at compile-time to make buffering more efficient. Since the target code conesponding to each node of an SDF graph is n01mally obtained from a hand-optimized libnuy of predefined blocks, the efficiency of data transfer between blocks is often the limiting factor in how closely an SDF compiler can approximate meticulous manual coding. Fmthermore, in the presence of large sample-rate changes, straightf01ward buffe1ing techniques can quickly exhaust limited on-chip data memory, necessitating the use of slower external memory. The techniques presented in this paper address both of these problems in a unified manner."

When storage optimization has been addressed, it is usually in conjunction with time optimization, such as in instruction-reducing code transformations. In the Bliss Compiler (WJWHG75), a storage-optimizing compiler, transformations that reduce register temporary storage are also performed, but automatic overlay of program variables is not addressed.\n The rising popularity of mini-computers and micro-processors suggests that the time has come to examine the problem of automatic storage optimization in its totality. Because lack of space has always been a problem in the small systems environment, the proliferation of small machines implies the growing importance of the problem. Although the decreasing cost of memory may mitigate this trend, a variant of Murphy's Law ensures that program size will always increase faster than the available storage. In other words, programmers always write programs that don't fit, and, as time goes on, more of them will be doing it."

                "text": "Interprocessor communication (IPC) overheads have emerged as the major performance limitation in parallel processing systems, due to the transmission delays, synchronization overheads, and conflicts for shared communication resources created by data exchange. Accounting for these overheads is essential for attaining efficient hardware utilization. This thesis introduces two new compile-time heuristics for scheduling precedence graphs onto multiprocessor architectures, which account for interprocessor communication overheads and interconnection constraints in the architecture. These algorithms perform scheduling and routing simultaneously to account for irregular interprocessor interconnections, and schedule all communications as well as all computations to eliminate shared resource contention. \nThe first technique, called dynamic-level scheduling, modifies the classical HLFET list scheduling strategy to account for IPC and synchronization overheads. By using dynamically changing priorities to match nodes and processors at each step, this technique attains an equitable tradeoff between load balancing and interprocessor communication cost. This method is fast, flexible, widely targetable, and displays promising performance. \nThe second technique, called declustering, establishes a parallelism hierarchy upon the precedence graph using graph-analysis techniques which explicitly address the tradeoff between exploiting parallelism and incurring communication cost. By systematically decomposing this hierarchy, the declustering process exposes parallelism instances in order of importance, assuring efficient use of the available processing resources. In contrast with traditional clustering schemes, this technique can adjust the level of cluster granularity to suit the characteristics of the specific architecture, leading to a more effective solution."

                "text": "Since the spring of 1988, Carnegie Mellon University and the Naval Air Development Center have been working together to implement several large signal processing systems on the Warp parallel computer. In the course of this work, we have developed a prototype of a software tool that can automatically and efficiently map signal processing systems to distributed-memory parallel machines, such as Warp. We have used this tool to produce Warp implementations of small test systems. The automatically generated programs compare favorably with hand-crafted code. We believe this tool will be a significant aid in the creation of high speed signal processing systems. We assume that signal processing systems have the following characteristics: \u2022They can be described by directed graphs of computational tasks; these graphs may contain thousands of task vertices. \u2022 Some tasks can be parallelized in a systolic or data-partitioned manner, while others cannot be parallelized at all. \u2022 The side effects of each task, if any, are limited to changes in local variables. \u2022 Each task has a data-independent execution time bound, which may be expressed as a function of the way it is parallelized, and the number of processors it is mapped to. In this paper we describe techniques to automatically map such systems to Warp-like parallel machines. We identify and address key issues in gracefully combining different parallel programming styles, in allocating processor, memory and communication bandwidth, and in generating and scheduling efficient parallel code. When iWarp, the VLSI version of the Warp machine, becomes available in 1990, we will extend this tool to generate efficient code for very large applications, which may require as many as 3000 iWarp processors, with an aggregate peak performance of 60 gigaflops."

                "text": "World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured hypertext documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables project is an effort to extract and make use of the huge number of these structured tables on the Web. A clean collection of relational-style ta- bles could be useful for improving web search, schema de- sign, and many other applications. This paper describes the first stage of the WebTables project. First, we give an in-depth study of the Web's HTML table corpus. For example, we extracted 14.1 billion HTML ta- bles from a several-billion-page portion of Google's general- purpose web crawl, and estimate that 154 million of these tables contain high-quality relational-style data. We also de- scribe the crawl's distribution of table sizes and data types. Second, we describe a system for performing relation recov- ery. The Web mixes relational and non-relational tables indiscriminately (often on the same page), so there is no simple way to distinguish the 1.1% of good relations from the remainder, nor to recover column label and type infor- mation. Our mix of hand-written detectors and statistical classifiers takes a raw Web crawl as input, and generates a collection of databases that is five orders of magnitude larger than any other collection we are aware of. Relation recovery achieves precision and recall that are comparable to other domain-independent information extraction systems."

The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

Ontologies and the Semantic Web are offered as a potential solution, but creating ontologies for real-world knowledge is nontrivial. If we could automate the process, we could significantly improve our chances of making the Semantic Web a reality. While understanding natural language is difficult, tables and other structured information make it easier to interpret new items and relations. In this paper we introduce an approach to generating ontologies based on table analysis. We thus call our approach TANGO (Table ANalysis for Generating Ontologies). Based on conceptual modeling extraction techniques, TANGO attempts to (i) understand a table's structure and conceptual content; (ii) discover the constraints that hold between concepts extracted from the table; (iii) match the recognized concepts with ones from a more general specification of related concepts; and (iv) merge the resulting structure with other similar knowledge representations. TANGO is thus a formalized method of processing the format and content of tables that can serve to incrementally build a relevant reusable conceptual ontology."

We also argue that the visual cues embedded within the HTML text, are utilized by the authors to direct the viewer on how to read the contents contained a web table properly. We develop a framework for comprehensively analyzing the structural aspects of a web table, within which rules are devised to process and extract attribute-value pairs from the table.

The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions."

This system is designed to provide additional data to an existing querying system called MIEL, which relies on a common vocabulary used to query local relational databases. We will use the same vocabulary, translated into an OWL ontology, to annotate the tables. Our annotation system is unsupervised. It uses only the knowledge defined in the ontology to automatically annotate the entire content of tables, using an aggregation approach: first annotate cells, then columns, then relations between those columns. The annotations are fuzzy: instead of linking an element of the table with a precise concept of the ontology, the elements of the table are annotated with several concepts, associated with their relevance degree. Our annotation process has been validated experimentally on scientific domains (microbial risk in food, chemical risk in food) and a technical domain (aeronautics)."

In practice, encoding the layout of each information source is impossible. This work presents a novel semantic search approach capable of extracting information from general tables. Semantic ontology allows our agents to read tables in the same knowledge domain with different layouts. In addition, a system of layout syntax and a set of transformation rules are defined to transform tables into databases without losing their semantic meanings."

We show: a) how to integrate different document structure finders into the HMM; b) that transition probabilities should vary along the chain to embed general knowledge axioms of our field, c) some emission energies can be selectively ignored, and d) emission and transition probabilities can be weighed differently. We conclude these changes increase the expressiveness and usability of HMMs in our field."

The mean annual cycle and the El Nino and La Nina composites of the Leeuwin Current temperature structures are obtained by linearly fitting a Taylor expansion to historical upper ocean temperature data. A temperature-salinity relationship is used to derive the salinity field and geostrophy is assumed to calculate the current velocity. The downward tilting of the isotherms toward the coast and the strength of a near-surface core of the low-salinity water indicate the seasonal variation of the Leeuwin Current. Seasonally, the Leeuwin Current has the maximum poleward geostrophic transport of 5 Sv (106 m3 s\u22121) during June\u2013July. Interannually, the Leeuwin Current is distinctly stronger during a La Nina year and weaker during an El Nino year. The annual average poleward geostrophic transports in the mean, the El Nino and La Nina years are 3.4, 3.0, and 4.2 Sv respectively. Variations of the Leeuwin Current structure on annual and interannual timescales are coastally trapped. A linear relationship between the coastal sea level deviation at Fremantle and the Leeuwin Current transport is derived, which justifies and calibrates the usage of the Fremantle sea level as an index for the strength of the Leeuwin Current."

This is supported by in situ temperature measurements at a coastal monitoring station on the Western Australian continental shelf that have shown a mean temperature rise of 0.013 \u25e6 C year \u22121 since 1951, corresponding to \u223c0.6 \u25e6 C over the past 5 decades. Measurements from three other shallow stations between 1985 and 2004 indicated warming trends of 0.026- 0.034 \u25e6 C year \u22121 . It is suggested that enhanced air-sea heat flux into the south-eastern Indian Ocean may be a key factor in the rising temperature trend. There has also been a steady rise in salinity over the past half-century. At interannual scales, coherent temperature variability at the various stations indicates that larger-scale processes are influencing the shelf waters and are linked with El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related events in coastal sea level and hence the Leeuwin Current."

                "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that one area of greatest increase in surface sea temperatures (SST) (0.02\u00b0C per year) in the Indian Ocean over the last 50 years occurs off the lower west coast of Australia, an area dominated by the Leeuwin Current. The present paper examines water temperature trends at several coastal sites since the early 1970s: two rock lobster puerulus monitoring sites in shallow water (<5 m); four sites from a monitoring program onboard rock lobster vessels that provide bottom water temperature (<36 m); and an environmental monitoring site at Rottnest (0\u201350 m depth). Two global SST datasets are also examined. These data show that there was a strong seasonal variation in the historic increases in temperature off the lower west coast of Australia, with most of the increases (0.02\u20130.035\u00b0C per year) only focussed on 4\u20136 months over the austral autumn\u2013winter with little or no increase (<0.01\u00b0C per year) apparent in the austral spring\u2013summer period. These increases are also apparent after taking into account the interannual variation in the strength of the Leeuwin Current. The warming trend results in a change to the seasonal temperature cycle over the decades, with a delay in the peak in the temperature cycle during autumn between the 1950s and 2000s of ~10\u201320 days. A delay in the timing of the minimum temperature is also apparent at Rottnest from August\u2013September to October. This seasonal variation in water temperature increases and its effect on the annual temperature cycle should be examined in climate models because it provides the potential to better understand the specific processes through which climate change and global warming are affecting this region of the Indian Ocean. It also provides an opportunity to further test the climate models to see whether this aspect is predicted in the future projections of how increases will be manifest. Any seasonal variation in water temperature increase has important implications for fisheries and the marine ecosystem because it may affect many aspects of the annual life cycle such as timing of growth, moulting, mating, spawning and recruitment, which have to be taken into account in the stock assessment and management of fisheries."

Observations of two common damselfish between 1977 and 2002 (with enhanced detail of fish size categories from 1994) show that the bulk of new recruits settle at Pocillopora Reef in March/April, a time when the Leeuwin Current is strengthening and the Capes Current is waning. Very large recruitment pulses in 1999 and 2000 were in La Nina years when the Leeuwin Current was very strong and water temperatures were at record high levels, but a third relatively strong pulse in 1995 was during an El Nino period with a weak Leeuwin Current (albeit with elevated ocean temperatures). Both advection and temperature therefore appear to play significant roles in recruitment at Rottnest Island, while biological factors such as food and predation during the pelagic stage must also be considered. The potential role of algal rafts in enhancing larval transport and survival may be important in the recruitment process and needs further research."

This review of these relationships has revealed that the addition of more recent data has strengthened the relationship for western rock lobster, the only species whose larvae are primarily distributed in the area of the influence of the Leeuwin Current and its offshore eddies. For other species, particularly scallops and whitebait, while the addition of new data has weakened the LC relationships, other as yet unquantifiable factors now appear to be more important determinants of changing abundance. For a number of the scalefish species (e.g., south coast Australian salmon), discontinuation of juvenile monitoring and the lack of ongoing records of comparable abundance data, primarily as a consequence of changes in the distribution of fishing, relative to the distribution of the stocks, has precluded ongoing exploration of earlier relationships. However preliminary data for some hitherto unreported relationships for other coastal scalefish species suggest that some physical and biological variables that are likely to be influenced by both the Leeuwin and Capes Currents may also be important. To help unravel these relationships, the underlying mechanism of the influence of the current, particularly the role of the northward flowing, mid-shelf Capes Current and salinity of shelf waters, and factors controlling the availability of nutrients to on-shelf primary productivity need to be better understood."

Westerly winds, also positively correlated with puerulus settlement, probably assist the transport of larvae to the coast during settlement. We examined relationships between (a) monthly sea-surface temperature where phyllosoma larvae occur \u2013 and annual levels of puerulus settlement at locations throughout the fishery and (b) monthly variation in Leeuwin Current strength (and westerly winds) and annual puerulus settlement later in the year (August\u2013January). The Leeuwin Current, when it begins to strengthen during February\u2013April, was highly correlated with puerulus settlement; sea-surface temperature during this period may have strongly influenced puerulus settlement at many locations. Its influence on puerulus settlement may have been due to improved larval survival and growth caused by higher water temperatures associated with a stronger Leeuwin Current in April or to increased retention of larvae close to the coast. In years when the southward-flowing Leeuwin Current was very strong, settlement in the southern locations was relatively higher than that farther north. In years of strong puerulus settlement, settlement also occurred earlier in the season."

In fact, when a robot handles complex uncertain environments, ach of its perceived states depends not only on what it currently observes but also on the sequence of observations the robot made before as well as the sequence of decisions the robot made so far. The author suggests that maintaining memory of all this is resou rce consuming and instead one should, among other things, compactly represent states of the world that repeat themselves or are equivalent . These states can be learnt from data, thus creating useful new concepts that can be used as predicates in rules. In our table assembly problem, we inherently proceed to more c mpact representations of the world, starting with characters, then groupi ng these into cells, and these into columns, and these into tables. Kaelbling (2006)\u2019s sug gestions seems to fit naturally."
