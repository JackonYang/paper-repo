Hidden Markov Models (HMM) provide a powerful method to cope with both of these, and their use made a breakthrough in speech recognition. However, the a priori choice of a model topology and weak discriminative power limit HMM capabilities. Recently, connectionist models have been recognized as an alternative tool. Their main useful properties lie in their discriminative power while capturing input-output relations. They have also proved useful in dealing with statistical data. However, the sequential aspect remains difficult to handle in connectionist models. The statistical use of a particular classic form of a connectionist system, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), is described in the context of the recognition of continuous speech. Relations with Hidden Markov Models are explained and preliminary results are reported."

Among our results are the following bounds on appropriate sample vs. network size. Assume 0 < \u220a 1/8. We show that if m O(W/\u220a log N/\u220a) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 \u220a/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 \u220a of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than (W/\u220a) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 \u220a fraction of the future test examples."

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples."

When a scientist succeeds in explaining a set of nobservations using a model Mof complexity c then it is generally believed that the likelihood of finding another explanatory model with similar complexity but leading to opposite predictions decreases with increasing nand decreasing c. This paper derives formal relationships between n, c and the probability of ambiguous predictions by examining three modeling languages under binary classification tasks: perceptrons, Boolean formulae, and Boolean networks. Bounds are also derived for the probability of error associated with the policy of accepting only models of complexity not exceeding c. Human tendency to regard the simpler as the more trustworthy is given a qualified justification."
