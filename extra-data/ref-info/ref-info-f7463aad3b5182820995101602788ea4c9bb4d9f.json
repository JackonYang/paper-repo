The task of these distributions is to predict the probability of a new word by looking at M or even all predecessor words. The conventional approach is to limit M to 1 or 2 and to interpolate the resulting bigram and trigram models with a unigram model in a linear fashion. However, there are many other structures that can be used to model the probabilistic dependences between the predecessor word and the word to be predicted. The structures considered in this paper are: nonlinear interpolation as an alternative to linear interpolation; equivalence classes for word histories and single words; cache memory and word associations. For the optimal estimation of nonlinear and linear interpolation parameters, the leaving-one-out method is systematically used. For the determination of word equivalence classes in a bigram model, an automatic clustering procedure has been adapted. To capture long-distance dependences, we consider various models for word-by-word dependences; the cache model may be viewed as a special type of self-association. Experimental results are presented for two text databases, a Germany database and an English database."

For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations \"eat a peach\" and \"eat a beach\" is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on \"most similar\" words.We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error."

Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering. Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated with respect to held-out test data."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

Theoretical analysis and comparative simulations indicate that the learning algorithm tracks the best transducer from an arbitrarily large (possibly infinite) pool of models. We also present an application of the model for inducing a noun phrase recognizer."

The author proposes that the semantics of words and contexts in a text be represented as vectors. The dimensions of the space are words and the initial vectors are determined by the words occurring close to the entity to be represented, which implies that the space has several thousand dimensions (words). This makes the vector representations (which are dense) too cumbersome to use directly. Therefore, dimensionality reduction by means of a singular value decomposition is employed.
