In this paper I will discuss several defects of vision and the classical theories of how they are overcome. I will criticize these theories and suggest an alternative approach, in which the outside world is considered as a kind of external memory store which can be accessed instantaneously by casting one's eyes (or one's attention) to some location. The feeling of the presence and extreme richness of the visual world is, under this view, a kind of illusion, created by the immediate availability of the information in this external store."

However, when brief blank fields are placed between alternating displays of an original and a modified scene, a striking failure of perception is induced: Identification of changes becomes extremely difficult, even when changes are large and made repeatedly. Identification is much faster when a verbal cue is provided, showing that poor visibility is not the cause of this difficulty. Identification is also faster for objects considered to be important in the scene. These results support the idea that observers never form a complete, detailed representation of their surroundings. In addition, the results indicate that attention is required to perceive change, and that in the absence of localized motion signals, attention is guided on the basis of high-level interest."

When viewing a scene, we seem to use detailed representations of object properties and interobject relations to achieve a sense of continuity across views. Yet, several recent studies show that human observers fail to detect changes to objects and object properties when localized retinal information signaling a change is masked or eliminated (e.g., by eye movements). However, these studies changed arbitrarily chosen objects which may have been outside the focus of attention. We draw on previous research showing the importance of spatiotemporal information for tracking objects by creating short motion pictures in which objects in both arbitrary locations and the very center of attention were changed. Adult observers failed to notice changes in both cases, even when the sole actor in a scene transformed into another person across an instantaneous change in camera angle (or \u201ccut\u201d)."

The commonly held explanation is known as the schema hypothesis, according to which a visual scene is rapidly identified as a member of a semantic category, and predictions generated from the scene category are then used to aid subsequent object identification. In this paper I will first outline and offer a critique of the evidence that has been taken to support the schema hypothesis. I will then offer an alternative framework for understanding scene processing, which I will call the local-processing hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes a modular, informationally-encapsulated architecture, and explicitly includes the role of covert visual attention in scene processing."

The model tries to cover the entire range from behavior and phenomenological experience to detailed neural encodings in crude but computationally plausible reductive steps. The problems addressed include perceptual constancies, eye movements and the stable visual world, object descriptions, perceptual generalizations, and the representation of extrapersonal space. The entire development is based on an action-oriented notion of perception. The observer is assumed to be continuously sampling the ambient light for information of current value. The central problem of vision is taken to be categorizing and locating objects in the environment. The critical step in this process is the linking of visual information to symbolic object descriptions; this is called indexing, from the analogy of identifying a book from index terms. The system must also identify situations and use this knowledge to guide movement and other actions in the environment. The treatment focuses on the different representations of information used in the visual system. The four representational frames capture information in the following forms: retinotopic, head-based, symbolic, and allocentric. The functional roles of the four frames, the communication among them, and their suggested neurophysiological realization constitute the core of the paper. The model is perforce crude, but appears to be consistent with all relevant findings."

This assumption has been challenged by experiments in which participants were unable to identify what Gestalt grouping patterns had occurred in the background of primary-task displays (A. Mack, B. Tang, R. Tuma, S. Kahn, & I. Rock, 1992). In the present study, participants reported which of 2 horizontal lines was longer. Dots in the background, if grouped, formed displays similar to the Ponzo illusion (Experiments 1 and 2) or the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion (Experiment 3). Despite inaccurate reports of what the patterns were, participants' responses on the line-length discrimination task were clearly affected by the 2 illusions. These results suggest that Gestalt grouping does occur without attention but that the patterns thus formed may not be encoded in memory without attention."

Yet we come to perceive solidity and depth. We can do this because a number of cues about depth are available in the retinal image: shading, perspective, occlusion of one object by another and stereoscopic disparity. In some mysterious way the brain is able to exploit these cues to recover the three-dimensional shapes of objects. Of the many mechanisms employed by the visual system to recover the third dimension, the ability to exploit shading is probably the most primitive. One reason for believing this is that in the natural world many animals have evolved pale undersides, presumably to make themselves less visible to predators. \"Countershading\" compensates for the shading effects caused by the sun shining from above and has at least two benefits: it reduces the contrast with the background and it \"flattens\" the animal's perceived shape. The prevalence of countershading in a variety of species, including many fishes, suggests that shading may be a crucial source of information about three-dimensional shape.

This ability to performvisual search has been the subject of a large body of research in the past 15 years. This paper reviews the visual search literature and presents a model of human search behavior. Built upon the work of Neisser, Treisman, Julesz, and others, the model distinguishes between a preattentive, massively parallel stage that processes information about basic visual features (color, motion, various depth cues, etc.) across large portions of the visual field and a subsequent limited-capacity stage that performs other, more complex operations (e.g., face recognition, reading, object identification) over a limited portion of the visual field. The spatial deployment of the limited-capacity process is under attentional control. The heart of the guided search model is the idea that attentional deployment of limited resources isguided by the output of the earlier parallel processes. Guided Search 2.0 (GS2) is a revision of the model in which virtually all aspects of the model have been made more explicit and/or revised in light of new data. The paper is organized into four parts: Part 1 presents the model and the details of its computer simulation. Part 2 reviews the visual search literature on preattentive processing of basic features and shows how the GS2 simulation reproduces those results. Part 3 reviews the literature on the attentional deployment of limited-capacity processes in conjunction and serial searches and shows how the simulation handles those conditions. Finally, Part 4 deals with shortcomings of the model and unresolved issues."

An even larger body of research concerns attended visual stimuli. Indeed, most vision research involves asking subject to direct attention to some stimulus and to report on it. Very little research has considered post-attentive vision. What is the visual representation of an object after attention has been deployed to that object and, then, deployed elsewhere. Do the effects of attention persist after attention has been removed? Based on a series of eight experiments, we argue that the perceptual effects of attention to an object last only so long as attention is directed to that object. In the experiments reported here, observers are asked to perform the same task repeatedly with the same, unchanging visual stimuli. Experiments One through Six are visual search experiments. In a standard search task, subjects look for a target item in a search display filled with distractors. On each trial, a new search display is presented. In our \"repeated search\" tasks. The search display is not changed. Subjects search the same display for a new target. The basic finding is that the efficiency of search (as measured by the slope of RT x set size functions) does not change markedly. If a search is inefficient when a display is examined for the first time, it is inefficient when that display is examined the second time, the fifth time or the 300th time. Experiment Seven and Eight make a similar point with a different, curve tracing paradigm. We discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of scene perception, change detection, and the relationship of vision to memory."

In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

Not all object individuation is plausibly viewed as emerging from an innate object module. In particular, the identification of objects in a static scene draws on a person's prior experience with the objects and on sensitivity to cues such as discontinuities in color and texture. These are the same factors that apply for the individuation of nonobject entities such as parts, suggesting that the procedures for nonobject individuation can sometimes extend to objects as well. Note, however, that although infants are sensitive to object properties such as spatiotemporal continuity, the ability to exploit these other types of cues is not present early in development (for discussion, see Baillargeon &c Hanko-Summers, 1990; Spelke, Breinlinger, )acobson, & Phillips, 1993). This developmental dissociation suggests that although the two modes of individuation might sometimes apply to the same entities (objects), they are nonetheless distinct."

These memory traces interact with attentional mechanisms to guide eye movements, cognition, and action. Two different memory mechanisms are described here. First, the deployments of focal attention and eye movements are facilitated towards recently attended features and locations (priming of popout). Second, attention is guided by implicit memory traces of specific visual contexts experienced in the past (contextual cueing). Compared to the visual memory tapped by change blindness tasks, the implicit memory mechanisms of priming of popout and contextual cueing do not require conscious intervention and may exhibit greater memory capacity, longer durability, and higher discriminability. Thus, these implicit traces of past views guide attention and eye movements to allow for effective access (indexing) to a scene's details, hence providing context and continuity to ongoing interactions with the perceptual world."

However, the question remains of how processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment 1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale. The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations."

Memory was tested by recognition and reconstruction tests, given immediately and/or after a week. Organization of the pictures had little effect on memory for size, orientation, or physical appearance of objects in the pictures. There was only a small loss of these types of descriptive information over a week's time. Organization of the pictures had a major effect on memory for location of objects in the pictures. Memory for location on the horizontal dimension declined markedly for both types of pictures over a week. Performance remained high on the vertical dimension for organized pictures, and systematic distortion occurred on this dimension for unorganized pictures. Reconstruction data were compared with the performance of subjects who had not seen the pictures before. It was concluded that real-world schemata do not affect encoding of some types of descriptive information, but play an important role in both encoding and memory for spatial information."

It was found that an upward-tilted target object among downward-tilted distracting objects was detected faster than when the orientation of target and distractors was reversed. This indicates that the early visual process regards objects tilted downward with respect to the observer as the situation that is more likely to be encountered. That is, the system is set up to expect to see the tops of these objects. We also found a visual field anisotropy, in that the asymmetry was more pronounced in the lower visual field. These findings are consistent with the idea that the tops of objects are usually situated in the lower visual field and less often in the upper field. Examination of the conditions under which the asymmetry and the anisotropy occur demonstrated the importance of the three-dimensional nature of the stimulus objects. Early visual processing thus makes use of heuristics that take into account specific relationships between the relative locations in space of the observer and 3-D objects."

The distinction between objects was manipulated across a wide spatial extent. Target elements appeared on the same object only when far apart, and appeared close only when on different objects, so that object effects could not be reduced to spatial effects, nor vice versa. Subjects judged whether two odd elements within a display of two dashed lines were the same or different. They performed better when the target elements were far apart on a common line rather than on two distinct lines, even though the latter arrangement was more likely. Thus, nonstrategic object-based limits on divided attention can arise even across large distances. However, when subjects were precued to expect targets in a narrow region of the display, the object effect was eliminated, implying that object-based selection may only operate within spatially attended regions."

To determine the mechanisms behind this induced \u201cchange blindness\u201d, four experiments examine its dependence on initial preview and on the nature of the interruptions used.

Displays were arrays of rectangles, with the target being the item that continually changed its orientation or contrast polarity. Five aspects of performance were examined: linearity of response, processing time, capacity, selectivity, and memory trace. Detection of change was found to be a self-terminating process requiring a time that increased linearly with the number of items in the display. Capacity for orientation was found to be about five items, a value comparable to estimates of attentional capacity. Observers were able to filter out both static and dynamic variations in irrelevant properties. Analysis also indicated a memory for previously attended locations. These results support the hypothesis that the process needed to detect change is much the same as the attentional process needed to detect complex static patterns. Interestingly, the features of orientation and polarity were found to be handled in somewhat different ways. Taken together, these results not only provide evidence that focused attention is needed to see change, but also show that change detection itself can provide new insights into the nature of attentional processing."

We all share an interest in such questions as \u201cWhat is \u2018now\u2019?\u2019\u2019 and \u201cWhy is it for each of us always \u2018now\u2019?\u2019\u2019 From the eternal now, we view in memory a past which is our entire stock of information and wisdom. Only now do we attempt in imagination to anticipate the future. Only now may we decide, and now decide we must, for the decision not t o choose among the remaining alternatives is itself one of the alternatives. Only now do we act. Some of you may know that I am credited in the literature with another paper of precisely the same title as this.\u2019 You may wonder why I should confuse matters by thus having two different papers of the same title, delivered ten years apart. The reasons are, I believe, simple and sufficient. Had I not already given the older part of this paper, I should have been forced to give it now, a t least so much of it as would have been possible within the limits of the time available. Happily, the paper does exist and we may simply talk about i t in a more relaxed and enjoyable way. But there is, from my point of view, more to the story. The older part of the paper is incomplete. Henry Quastler, the editor, did a magnificent job of reducing to so slender a volume as Information Theory in Psychology what the participants in the Allerton Park Conference literally lived in five days. On rereading my contribution ten years later, I must admit to a feeling of very real pride a t having my name on it as author. There are no significant changes I would make. What is missing in the paper was missing a t the conference and is present here. There we looked inward as it were, upon a narrow and specific discipline, psychology. Here we look outward a t all things in the universe.that we may in some fashion or another apprehend. Let us review briefly the contents of that ten-year-old paper. Centrally, it concerned an effort to determine the relationships between what was called \u201cpsychological time\u201d and the time of classical Newtonian physical theory and its experimental measurement. Psychological time is the time in which we are aware of things happening, where we are aware of events some of which occur before others, and some of which occur together. For the nature of the various notions of time in physical theories, I refer you to the papers given by the other members of the conference. I t has been known for over a century that there are some nontrivial differences between the time of the given experience of the physicist as a man and the time of his physics, the genetically rather than socially inherited discipline, but i t has not excited anything like the interest roused by the differences among physicists and between varieties of physics on the subject of physical time."

                "text": "A computational theory is developed that explains how line drawings of polyhedral objects can be interpreted rapidly and in parallel at early levels of human vision. The key idea is that a time-limited process can correctly recover much of the three-dimensional structure of these objects when split into concurrent streams, each concerned with a single aspect of scene structure. The work proceeds in five stages. The first extends the framework of Marr to allow a process to be analyzed in terms of resource limitations. Two main concerns are identified: (i) reducing the amount of nonlocal information needed, and (ii) making effective use of whatever information is obtained. The second stage traces the difficulty of line interpretation to a small set of constraints. When these are removed, the remaining constraints can be grouped into several relatively independent sets. It is shown that each set can be rapidly solved by a separate processing stream, and that co-ordinating these streams can yield a low-complexity ``approximation'''' that captures much of the structure of the original constraints. In particular, complete recovery is possible in logarithmic time when objects have rectangular corners and the scene-to-image projection is orthographic. The third stage is concerned with making good use of the available information when a fixed time limit exists. This limit is motivated by the need to obtain results within a time independent of image content, and by the need to limit the propagation of inconsistencies. A minimal architecture is assumed, viz., a spatiotopic mesh of simple processors. Constraints are developed to guide the course of the process itself, so that candidate interpretations are considered in order of their likelihood. The fourth stage provides a specific algorithm for the recovery process, showing how it can be implemented on a cellular automaton. Finally, the theory itself is tested on various line drawings. It is shown that much of the three-dimensional structure of a polyhedral scene can indeed be recovered in very little time. It also is shown that the theory can explain the rapid interpretation of line drawings at early levels of human vision."

First, overt adjustments of gaze direction can be made to control which regions of the visual scene are processed by the sensitive fovea and its associated neural machinery. Second, covert adjustments can be made to determine which specific objects or regions are selected (in the absence of gaze changes) for preferential treatment. Overt orienting can be directly observed in the form of eye movements; convert orienting involves an internal adjustment and must be inferred from performance patterns. James (1890) probably had a distinction of this sort in mind when he contrasted adjustment of the sensory organs with an internal \u201canticipatory preparation.\u201d"

Such evidence has been used to suggest that the spatio-temporal coherence needed to represent change can only occur in the presence of focused attention. In four experiments we use modified change blindness tasks to demonstrate (a) that sensitivity to change does occur in the absence of awareness, and (b) this sensitivity does not rely on the redeployment of attention. We discuss these results in relation to theories of scene perception, and propose a reinterpretation of the role of attention in representing change."

Displays of 10 alphanumeric characters were presented and, after a brief offset, were presented again in the same position, with or without a change in a single character. Subjects\u2019 accuracy in change detection did not suggest preservation of any more information than is usually available in whole report, except with the briefest of offsets (under 50 msec). Stimulus duration had only modest effects. The interaction of masking with offset duration followed the pattern previously observed with unfamiliar visual stimuli (Phillips, 1974). Accuracy was not reduced by reflection of the characters about a horizontal axis, suggesting that categorical information contributed negligibly. Detection of change appears to depend upon capacity-limited visual memory; (putative) knowledge of what identities are present in different display locations does not seem to contribute."

Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition."

Although existing theories of metacontrast and pattern masking say \u201cno,\u201d we report this occurs when targets appear in unpredictable locations. In three experiments, a four-dot mask was compared with a standard metacontrast mask that surrounded the target. Although accuracy was predictably different for the two masks at a central display location in Experiment I, both masks had similar strong effects on accuracy in parafoveal locations. Experiment 2 revealed that both four-dot and metacontrast masking were insensitive to contour proximity in parafoveal display locations, and Experiment 3 showed that four-dot masking could occur even at a central location if attention was distributed among several targets. We propose that targets in unattended locations are coded with low spotiotemporal resolution, leaving them vulnerable to substitution by the four dots when attention is directed to them."

Here we manipulate binocular disparity to degrade visual search, so that otherwise identical features become parts of surfaces through perceptual completion, rendering them less clearly distinguishable as targets and abstractors.

Complexity level analysis may resolve this contradiction. Visual search can be reshaped into tractability through approximations and by optimizing the resources devoted to visual processing. Architectural constraints can be derived using the minimum cost principle to rule out a large class of potential solutions. The evidence speaks strongly against bottom-up approaches to vision. In particular, the constraints suggest an attentional mechanism that exploits knowledge of the specific problem being solved. This analysis of visual search performance in terms of attentional influences on visual information processing and complexity satisfaction allows a large body of neurophysiological and psychological evidence to be tied together."

This attentional blink may serve to prevent interruption of ongoing target processing by temporarily suppressing vision for subsequent stimuli. We examined the level at which the internal blink operates, specifically, whether it prevents early visual processing or prevents quite substantial processing from reaching awareness. Our data support the latter view. We observed priming from missed letter targets, benefiting detection of a subsequent target with the same identity but a different case. In a second study, we observed semantic priming from word targets that were missed during the blink. These results demonstrate that attentional gating within the blink operates only after substantial stimulus processing has already taken place. The results are discussed in terms of two forms of visual representation, namely, types and tokens."

                "text": "SUMMARY Iconic memory has often been likened to a sensory store whose contents drain away rapidly as soon as the inducing stimulus is turned off. Instances of short-lived visible persistence have been explained in terms of the decaying contents of iconic store. A fundamental requirement of this storage model is that strength of persistence should be a decreasing function of time elapsed since the cessation\u2014not since the onset\u2014of the inducing stimulation. That is, strength of visible persistence may be directly related\u2014but not inversely related\u2014to the duration of the inducing stimulus. Two complementary paradigms were utilized in the present studies. In the first paradigm performance was facilitated by visible persistence in that the task required the bridging of a temporal gap between two successive displays. In the second paradigm (forward visual masking by pattern), performance was impaired by lingering visible persistence of the temporally leading mask. Both paradigms yielded evidence of an inverse relationship between duration of inducing stimulus and duration of visible persistence. More specifically, in a task requiring temporal integration of a pattern displayed briefly in two successive portions, performance was severely impaired if the duration of the leading part exceeded about 100 msec. This suggests an inverse relationship between duration of inducing stimulus and duration of sensory persistence and allows the inference that visual persistence may be identified more fittingly with ongoing neural processes than with the decaying contents of an iconic store. In keeping with this suggestion, two experiments disconfirmed the conjecture that lack of temporal integration following long inducing stimuli could be ascribed to emergence of unitary form separately in the two portions of the display or to the triggering of some sort of discontinuity detection mechanism within the visual system. In added support of a \"processing\" model, two further studies showed that the severity of forward masking by pattern declines sharply as the duration of the leading mask is increased. This pattern of results is equally unsupportive of a storage theory of iconic persistence as of perceptual moment theory in any of its versions. This is so because both theories regard interstimulus interval rather than stimulus-onset asynchrony as the crucial factor in temporal integration. Neither can the results be explained in terms of receptor adaptation or of metacontrast suppression. The theory of inhibitory channel interactions can encompass the more prominent aspects of the results but fails to account for foveal suppression and for some crucial temporal effects."

These target images were preceded by prime images of the same scene sans critical objects, or by control primes or different-scene primes. Reaction times were faster following same-scene primes than following the various control and different-scene primes. Same-scene facilitation was obtained with color primes, line-drawing primes, and primes with shifted views. The effect occurred with natural scenes having gist and simple artificial scenes having little or no gist. The results indicate that prime-induced representations influence the perception of spatial layout in pictures."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

The extent of change blindness in visual perception suggests limits on our capacity to encode, retain, and compare visual information from one glance to the next; our awareness of our visual surroundings is far more sparse than most people intuitively believe. These failures of awareness and the erroneous intuitions that often accompany them have both theoretical and practical ramifications. This article briefly summarizes the current state of research on change blindness and suggests future directions that promise to improve our understanding of scene perception and visual memory."

At time scales of approximately 1/3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level \u2013 more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this \u201cembodiment level,\u201d the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1/3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic bindings make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements."

Seven experiments involving search for line drawings contradict this assumption; a major determinant of search is the presence of line junctions. Arrow- and Y-junctions were detected rapidly in isolation and when they were embedded in drawings of rectangular polyhedra. Search for T-junctions was considerably slower. Drawings containing T-junctions often gave rise to very slow search even when distinguishing arrow- or Y-junctions were present. This sensitivity to line relations suggests that preattentive processes can extract 3-dimensional orientation from line drawings. A computational model is outlined for how this may be accomplished in early human vision."

This study demonstrates that a robust memory for visual context exists to guide spatial attention. Global context was operationalized as the spatial layout of objects in visual search displays. Half of the configurations were repeated across blocks throughout the entire session, and targets appeared within consistent locations in these arrays. Targets appearing in learned configurations were detected more quickly. This newly discovered form of search facilitation is termed contextual cueing. Contextual cueing is driven by incidentally learned associations between spatial configurations (context) and target locations. This benefit was obtained despite chance performance for recognizing the configurations, suggesting that the memory for context was implicit. The results show how implicit learning and memory of visual context can guide spatial attention towards task-relevant aspects of a scene."

This article explores three possible accounts based on (a) perceptual segregation, (b) conjunction detectors, and (c) inhibition controlled separately by two or more distractor features. Search rates for conjunctions of color, size, orientation, and direction of motion correlated closely with an independent measure of perceptual segregation. However, they appeared unrelated to the physiology of single-unit responses. Each dimension contributed additively to conjunction search rates, suggesting that each was checked independently of the others. Unknown targets appear to be found only by serial search for each in turn. Searching through 4 sets of distractors was slower than searching through 2. The results suggest a modification of feature integration theory, in which attention is controlled not only by a unitary \"window\" but also by a form of feature-based inhibition."

Consequently, many cognitive tasks, and much of everyday thought, necessitate switches between WM items. The research to be presented measured the time involved in switching attention between objects in WM and sought to elaborate the processes underlying such switches. Two experiments required subjects to maintain two running counts; the order in which the counts were updated necessitated frequent switches between them. Even after intensive practice, a time cost was incurred when subjects updated the two counts in succession, relative to updating the same count twice. This time cost was interpreted as being due to a distinct switching mechanism that controls an internal focus of attention large enough for just one object (count) at a time. This internal focus of attention is a subset of WM (Cowan, 1988). Alternative visual and conceptual repetition-priming and memory retrieval explanations for the cost involved in switching between items in WM are addressed."

They demonstrate an (attentional) algorithm which recursively examines the current knowledge of the scene in order best to choose the next fixation point in terms of focusing attention on regions of maximum boundary curvature. They discuss a simple metric for evaluating convergence over a scan path. This may be used to compare the performance of various attentional algorithms.

This phenomenon can have serious life-and-death consequences. Although the inextricable link between perceiving and attending was noted long ago by Aristotle, this phenomenon, now called inattentional blindness (IB), only recently has been named and carefully studied. Among the many questions that have been raised about IB are questions about the fate of the clearly visible, yet unseen stimuli, whether any stimuli reliably capture attention, and, if so, what they have in common. Finally, is IB an instance of rapid forgetting, or is it a failure to perceive?"

One distinctive aspect of the proposed model is the inclusion of two phases of sensory storage in each modality. The first phase extends sensation for several hundred milliseconds, whereas the second phase is a vivid recollection of sensation. The mechanism of at least the longer phase is the activation of features in long-term memory, comparable to the mechanism of non-sensory, short-term storage. Another distinctive aspect of the model is that habituation/dishabituation and central executive processes together are assumed to determine the focus of attention, without the need for either an early or a late attentional filter. Research issues that contribute to a comparison of models are discussed."

Why are small numbers of items enumerated differently from large numbers of items? It is suggested that subitizing relies on a preattentive mechanism. Ss could subitize heterogeneously sized multicontour items but not concentric multicontour items, which require attentional processing because preattentive gestalt processes misgroup contours from different items to form units. Similarly, Ss could subitize target items among distractors but only if the targets and distractors differed by a feature, a property derived through preattentive analysis. Thus, subitizing must rely on a mechanism that can handle a few items at once, which operates before attention but after preattentive operations of feature detection and grouping."

Three commonly observed neuronal effects in memory-demanding tasks are repetition suppression, enhancement, and delay activity. In repetition suppression, repeated experience with the same visual stimulus leads to both short- and long-term suppression of neuronal responses in subpopulations of visual neurons. Enhancement works in an opposite fashion, in that neuronal responses are enhanced for objects with learned behavioral relevance. Delay activity is found in tasks in which animals are required to actively hold specific information \"on-line\" for short periods. Repetition suppression appears to be an intrinsic property of visual cortical areas such as inferior temporal cortex and is thought to be important for perceptual learning and priming. By contrast, enhancement and delay activity may depend on feedback to temporal cortex from prefrontal cortex and are thought to be important for working memory. All of these mnemonic effects on neuronal responses bias the competitive interactions that take place between stimulus representations in the cortex when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. As a result, memory will often determine the winner of these competitions and, thus, will determine which stimulus is attended."

There are three relevant parameters: the circumferential index kappa which is defined as the number of pixels around the periphery of the sensor, the visual field radius R (of the half-disk to be mapped), and the map parameter a, which displaces the logarithm's singularity at the origin out of the domain of the mapping. It is shown that the log sensor requires O( kappa /sup 2/log (R/a)) pixels. An analysis is presented which makes it possible to compare directly the space complexity of different sensor designs in the complex logarithmic family. In particular, rough estimates can be obtained of the parameters necessary to duplicate the field width/resolution performance of the human visual system.<<ETX>>"
