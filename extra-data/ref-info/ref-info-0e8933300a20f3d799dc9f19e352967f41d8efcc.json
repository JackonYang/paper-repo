We describe a marginalization algorithm which works on junction trees, which is based on some newer developments in Bayesian networks. This is sufficiently general that Pearl's belief propagation and decoding on Tanner graphs may be regarded as special cases. An attempt to compute the discrete Fourier transform as a marginalization problem in this framework gives the fast Fourier transform algorithm, thus showing that this framework has applications apart from probabilistic computations. Junction graphs with cycles lead to an iterative algorithm. The case of junction graphs with a single cycle is analyzed, with specific results in the case of the sum-product algorithm. We also have some experimental results for small turbo code-like junction graphs. \n \nOn a different topic, we consider the typical set decoder, which can be used to obtain bounds on the noise threshold for asymptotically error free decoding, for given code ensembles. Some choices of the typical set for AWGN channel are considered and the resulting bounds on the threshold obtained."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201cTanner graph\u201d. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

A graph is shown which specifies carefully chosen subsets of the digits of the new codes that must be codewords in one of the shorter subcodes. Lower bounds to the rate and the minimum distance of the new code are derived in terms of the parameters of the graph and the subeodes. Both the encoders and decoders proposed are shown to take advantage of the code's explicit decomposition into subcodes to decompose and simplify the associated computational processes. Bounds on the performance of two specific decoding algorithms are established, and the asymptotic growth of the complexity of decoding for two types of codes and decoders is analyzed. The proposed decoders are able to make effective use of probabilistic information supplied by the channel receiver, e.g., reliability information, without greatly increasing the number of computations required. It is shown that choosing a transmission order for the digits that is appropriate for the graph and the subcodes can give the code excellent burst-error correction abilities.

We show that performance substantially better than that of standard convolutional and concatenated codes can be achieved; indeed the performance is almost as close to the Shannon limit as that of Turbo codes. A linear code may be described in terms of a generator matrix G or in terms of a parity check matrix H, which satisfies Hx = 0 for all codewords x. In 1962, Gallager reported work on binary codes defined in terms of low density parity check matrices (abbreviated \u2018GL codes\u2019) [5, 6]. The matrix H was defined in a non-systematic form; each column of H had a small weight (e.g., 3) and the weight per row was also uniform; the matrix H was constructed at random subject to these constraints. Gallager proved distance properties of these codes and described a probability-based decoding algorithm with promising empirical performance. However it appears that GL codes have been generally forgotten, the assumption perhaps being that concatenated codes [4] were superior for practical purposes (R.G. Gallager, personal communication). During our work on MN codes [8] we realised that it is possible to create \u2018good\u2019 codes from very sparse random matrices, and to decode them (even beyond their minimum distance) using approximate probabilistic algorithms. We eventually reinvented Gallager\u2019s decoding algorithm and GL codes. In this paper we report the empirical performance of these codes on Gaussian channels. We have proved theoretical properties of GL codes (essentially, that the channel coding theorem holds for them) elsewhere [9]. GL codes can also be defined over GF (q). We are currently implementing this generalization. We created sparse random parity check matrices in the following ways. Construction 1A. An M by N matrix (M rows, N columns) is created at random with weight per column t (e.g., t = 3), and weight per row as uniform as possible, and overlap between any two columns no greater than 1. (The weight of a column is the number of non-zero elements; the overlap between two columns is their inner product.)"

The generaliza- tion to 3' was given by Box et al. (1). Good (2) generalized these methods and gave elegant algorithms for which one class of applications is the calculation of Fourier series. In their full generality, Good's methods are applicable to certain problems in which one must multiply an N-vector by an N X N matrix which can be factored into m sparse matrices, where m is proportional to log N. This results inma procedure requiring a number of operations proportional to N log N rather than N2. These methods are applied here to the calculation of complex Fourier series. They are useful in situations where the number of data points is, or can be chosen to be, a highly composite number. The algorithm is here derived and presented in a rather different form. Attention is given to the choice of N. It is also shown how special advantage can be obtained in the use of a binary computer with N = 2' and how the entire calculation can be performed within the array of N data storage locations used for the given Fourier coefficients. Consider the problem of calculating the complex Fourier series N-1 (1) X(j) = EA(k)-Wjk, j = 0 1, * ,N- 1, k=0"

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

                "text": "Pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding are tasks that usually must deal with complex but structured natural or artificial systems. Patterns that we wish to classify are a consequence of a causal physical process. Images that we wish to compress are also a consequence of a causal physical process. Noisy outputs from a telephone line are corrupted versions of a signal produced by a structured man-made telephone modem. Not only are these tasks characterized by complex structure, but they also contain random elements. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks provide a way to describe the relationships between random variables in a stochastic system. \nIn this thesis, I use Bayesian networks as an overarching framework to describe and solve problems in the areas of pattern classification, data compression, and channel coding. Results on the classification of handwritten digits show that Bayesian network pattern classifiers outperform other standard methods, such as the k-nearest neighbor method. When Bayesian networks are used as source models for data compression, an exponentially large number of codewords are associated with each input pattern. It turns out that the code can still be used efficiently, if a new technique called \"bits-back coding\" is used. Several new error-correcting decoding algorithms are instances of \"probability propagation\" in various Bayesian networks. These new schemes are rapidly closing the gap between the performances of practical channel coding systems and Shannon's 50-year-old channel coding limit. The Bayesian network framework exposes the similarities between these codes and leads the way to a new class of \"trellis-constraint codes\" which also operate close to Shannon's limit."

The optimal equalizer is shown to consist of a matched filter followed by a very complex nonlinear transversal filter. Various approximations are made to simplify the transversal filter. Thus the optimal linear equalizer and two suboptimal nonlinear equalizers are obtained. The performance characteristics of these equalizers are compared in terms of eye patterns and error probabilities. These investigations exhibit a clear superiority of the nonlinear equalizers. Up to a certain peak distortion, intersymbol interference can be eliminated by nonlinear equalization With negligible noise enhancement. The error probability then closely approaches the error probability in the case of noninterfering signals."

The costs of implementation are linear in the length of data. Models can be nested to reflect hierarchical sources of knowledge. These and other desirable features have made hidden Markov methods increasingly attractive for problems in language, speech and signal processing. The basic ideas are introduced by elementary examples in the spirit of the Polya urn models. The main tool in hidden Markov modeling is the Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. This iterative algorithm is discussed both from an intuitive point of view as an exercise in the art of counting and from a formal point of view via the information-theoretic Q-function. Selected examples drawn from the literature illustrate how the Baum-Welch technique places a rich variety of computational models at the disposal of the researcher.<<ETX>>"

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

It is not essential that this factorization be interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities. The account given here avoids the divisions required by conditional probabilities and generalizes readily to alternative measures of subjective probability, such as Dempster-Shafer or Spohnian belief functions."

This paper presents backward, forward, and backward-forward models that weaken previous sufficient conditions and that include, but are not restricted to, optimization problems. The backward-forward model is devoted to the simultaneous solution of a collection of interrelated sequential problems based on the independent computation of a cost-to-arrive function and a cost-to-go function. Several extremization and nonextremization problems illustrate the applicability of the proposed models."
