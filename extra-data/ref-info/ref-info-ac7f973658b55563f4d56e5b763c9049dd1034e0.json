We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

We seek a model of appearance and motion that is generic in that it accounts for the ways in which people's appearance varies and, at the same time, is specific enough to be useful for tracking people in natural scenes. Given a 3D model of the person projected into an image we model the likelihood of observing various image cues conditioned on the predicted locations and orientations of the limbs. These cues are taken to be steered filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion-compensated temporal differences. Motivated by work on the statistics of natural scenes, the statistics of these filter responses for human limbs are learned from training images containing hand-labeled limb regions. Similarly, the statistics of the filter responses in general scenes are learned to define a \u201cbackground\u201d distribution. The likelihood of observing a scene given a predicted pose of a person is computed, for each limb, using the likelihood ratio between the learned foreground (person) and background distributions. Adopting a Bayesian formulation allows cues to be combined in a principled way. Furthermore, the use of learned distributions obviates the need for hand-tuned image noise models and thresholds. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the statistics of how people appear in scenes and provides a connection between work on natural image statistics and the Bayesian tracking of people."

To reduce the search required for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features, relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation of a face."

The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as input to a support vector machine classifier. The paradigm we present successfully handles the major difficulties of object detection: overcoming the in-class variability of complex classes such as faces and pedestrians and providing a very low false detection rate, even in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection; we extend the methodology to the domain of people which, unlike faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The thesis also introduces a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. This module is based on the realization that in regions of motion, the likely classes of objects are limited, so we can relax the strictness of the classifier. This does not compromise performance over non-moving objects. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may be extended to other domains.

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

High performance human detection depends on reliable contour extraction, but contour extraction is an under constrained problem without the knowledge about the objects to be detected. This paper proposes a recursive context reasoning (RCR) approach to solving the above dilemma. A TRS-invariant probabilistic model is designed to encode the shapes of the body parts and the context information | the size and spatial relationships between body parts. A Bayesian framework is developed to perform human detection and part identi cation under partial occlusion. A contour reconstruction procedure is introduced to integrate the human model and the identi ed body parts to predict the shapes and locations of the parts missed by the contour detector; the re ned contours are used to reevaluate the likelihood ratio. Therefore, contour extraction, part identi cation, and human detection are improved iteratively. The experimental results of the RCR approach to human detection and body parts identi cation in cluttered scenes are very encouraging."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."

We define a \"card-board person model\" in which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences."

We first consider the problem of detecting the whole face pattern by a single SVM classifier. In this context we compare different types of image features, present and evaluate a new method for reducing the number features and discuss practical issues concerning the parameterization of SVMs and the selection of training data. The second part of the paper describes a component-based method for face detection consisting of a two-level hierarchy of SVM classifiers. On the first level, component classifiers independently detect components of a face, such as the eyes, the nose, and the mouth. On the second level, a single classifier checks if the geometrical configuration of the detected components in the image matches a geometrical model of a face."

However they are not well suited to phenonena such as occlusion, where multiple components of an object may disappear simultaneously. We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic."

Portions of a limb's image appearance are seen from multiple views and for multiple subjects. From these partial views, weighted principal component analysis is used to construct a linear subspace representation of the \"unwrapped\" image appearance of each limb. The linear subspaces provide a generative model of the object appearance that is exploited in a Bayesian particle filtering tracking system.

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

This folk-belief - some would say folk-theorem - is incorrect. At the very least, the possible quantitative advantage of such adaptation is vastly smaller than commonly believed. We have recently constructed a tight frame of curvelets which provides stable, efficient, and near-optimal representation of otherwise smooth objects having discontinuities along smooth curves. By applying naive thresholding to the curvelet transform of such an object, one can form m-term approximations with rate of L(sup 2) approximation rivaling the rate obtainable by complex adaptive schemes which attempt to track' the discontinuity set. In this article we explain the basic issues of efficient m-term approximation, the construction of efficient adaptive representation, the construction of the curvelet frame, and a crude analysis of the performance of curvelet schemes."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

In this paper we introduce the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a Bayesian treatment of a generalised linear model of identical functional form to the SVM. The RVM suffers from none of the above disadvantages, and examples demonstrate that for comparable generalisation performance, the RVM requires dramatically fewer kernel functions."

Conditions for the occurrence of singularities in 3-D models are presented and their effects on tracking are characterized We describe a novel 2-D Scaled Prismatic Model (SPM) for figure registration. In contrast to 3-D kinematic models, the SPM has fewer singularity problems and does not require detailed knowledge of the 3-D kinematics. We fully characterize the singularities in the SPM and illustrate tracking through singularities using synthetic and real examples with 3-D and 2-D models. Our results demonstrate the significant benefits of the SPM in tracking with a single source of video."
