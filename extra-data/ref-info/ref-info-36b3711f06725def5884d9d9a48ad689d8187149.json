This study is directed toward the goal of developing effective methods of identifying phrases in natural language text from which good quality phrase descriptors can be constructed. The effectiveness of one method, a simple nonsyntactic phrase indexing procedure, has been tested on five experimental document collections. The results have been analyzed in order to identify the inadequacies of the procedure, and to determine what kinds of information about text structure are needed in order to construct phrase descriptors that are good indicators of document content. Two primary conclusions have been reached: (1) In the retrieval experiments, the nonsyntactic phrase construction procedure did not consistently yield substantial improvements in effectiveness. It is therefore not likely that phrase indexing of this kind will prove to be an important method of enhancing the performance of automatic document indexing and retrieval systems in operational environments. (2) Many of the shortcomings of the nonsyntactic approach can be overcome by incorporating syntactic information into the phrase construction process. However, a general syntactic analysis facility may be required, since many useful sources of phrases cannot be exploited if only a limited inventory of syntactic patterns can be recognized. Further research should be conducted into methods of incorporating automatic syntactic analysis into content analysis for document retrieval. \u00a9 1989 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

The dialogue supported has more symmetry than most interactive computer systems in that the machine forms an image (rather as a man does) of the view of the human enquirer, without requiring him to ask a precise question, and responds with references according to its image. Initial tests with a prototype program indicate that a performance equal to that obtainable from a more conventional on\u2010line retrieval system is possible without obliging the user to formulate his query."

In this paper we consider the situation where no relevance information is available, that is, at the start of the search. Based on a probabilistic model, strategies are proposed for the initial search and an intermediate search. Retrieval experiments with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents. The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative strategy."

                "text": "This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability. The resulting technique called \u201cProbabilistic Indexing,\u201d allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \u201crelevance number\u201d) for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request. The result of a search is an ordered list of those documents which satisfy the request ranked according to their probable relevance.\nThe paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\u201csee\u201d and \u201csee also\u201d) is based solely on the \u201csemantical closeness\u201d between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.\nFinally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user."

Recent articles have analyzed retrieval systems with continuous weights of either type and/or with a Boolean structure for the queries. They have also suggested criteria which such systems ought to satisfy and record evaluation mechanisms which partially satisfy these criteria. We offer a more careful analysis, based on a generalization of the discrete weights. We also look at the weights from an entirely different approach involving thresholds, and we generate an improved evaluation mechanism which seems to fulfill a larger subset of the desired criteria than previous mechanisms. This new mechanism allows the user to attach a \u201cthreshold\u201d to the query term."

In the closing pages of my earlier book on the subject I said the following: \u201cIt has never been assumed that a retrieval system should attempt to understand\u201d the content of a document. Most Information Retrieval systems at the moment merely aim at a bibliographic search. Documents are deemed to be relevant on the basis of a superficial description. I do not suggest that it is going to be a simple matter to program a computer to understand documents. What is suggested is that some attempt should be made to construct something like a naive model, using more than just keywords, of the content of each document in the system. The more sophisticated question-answering systems do something very similar. They have a model of their universe of discourse and can answer questions about it, and can incorporate new facts and rules as they become available (van Rijsbergen, 1979)."

Its main concern is with the weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."

The results would suggest that the single linkage method, which has been used extensively in previous work on document clustering, is not the most effective procedure of those tested, although it should be emphasized that the experiments have used only small document test collections."

Our study is based on the notions of user preference and an acceptable ranking strategy. Such an approach enables us to adopt a gradient descent algorithm to formulate the query vector by an inductive process. We also present a critical analysis of the existing relevance feedback and the probabilistic approaches. It is shown that Rocchio's method is a special case of our linear model and the independence assumption may be stronger than required for a linear system. Our method has the added advantages that it is applicable to both nonbinary document representation and a user preference relation inducing more than two classes. \u00a9 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Since its formation, in 1947, the Association has adhered to the originally established policy of informality. That is, meetings and discussions were encouraged and information was generally put out in mimeographed form and more formal publications were discouraged. The function of the organization was to maintain a mailing list of members paying only such dues as were necessary to cover the cost of printing or mimeographing and mailing. Such an organization served its purpose excellently, but times have changed.\nPrior to the formation of the Association, the automatic computing field, as such, hardly existed. Probably the first meeting of those interested in the field was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. The occasion was to introduce the differential analyzer, designed by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Dr. Samuel H. Caldwell, to the public. This machine is a refinement of the original machine built by Dr. Bush in 1925. The earlier machine served as a pattern for several machines which were in operation in 1945, including those at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, the General Electric Company and in Manchester, England.\nIt is interesting to note that, at the time of this first meeting, other analog type machines were in operation. Network analyzers were employed to simulate power distribution systems and aid in their study. None of these machines employed digital representation but represented the values in analog form, such as voltage, current or angular position. Digital computation was possible only by hand operated calculators or by some business machines.\n Although automatic digital computation by machinery was the goal Charles Babbage strove to reach, it was not until the Hollerith rotary counter was suggested in 1890 and the International Business Machines Corporation began producing machines employing such counters for accounting purposes in the period from 1903 to 1905, that such goal was reached. The automatic multiplying punch machine was not produced until 1931.\nComputation by means of telephone relays was first introduced in the Bell System Complex Computer, known as Model I, in 1939. The method of employing the relays was suggested by Dr. George R. Stibitz and the machine was designed by Samuel B. Williams. This was not a fully automatic machine.

While any document is in principle retrievable by a Boolean query, the amount of output obtainable by Boolean processing is difficult to control, and the retrieved items are not ranked in any presumed order of importance to the user population. In the vector processing model of retrieval, the retrieved items are easily ranked in decreasing order of the query-record similarity, but the queries themselves are unstructured and expressed as simple sets of weighted index terms. A new, extended Boolean information retrieval system is introduced which is intermediate between the Boolean system of query processing and the vector processing model. The query structure inherent in the Boolean system is preserved, while at the same time weighted terms may be incorporated into both queries and stored documents; the retrieved output can also be ranked in strict similarity order with the user queries. A conventional retrieval system can be modified to make use of the extended system. Laboratory tests indicate that the extended system produces better retrieval output than either the Boolean or the vector processing systems."
