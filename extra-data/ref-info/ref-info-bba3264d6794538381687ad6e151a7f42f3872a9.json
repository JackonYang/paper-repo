In a two-phase process, the input texture is first analyzed by measuring the joint occurrence of texture discrimination features at multiple resolutions. In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures than do previous techniques."

We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random im ages subject to these constraints using alternated projections, and demonstrate its effectivenes s on a wide range of synthetic and natural textures. We also show the flexibility of the repres entation, by applying to a variety of tasks which can be viewed as constrained image synthesis problems. Vision is arguably our most important sensory system, judging from both the ubiquity of visual forms of communication, and the large proportion of the human brain devoted to visual processing. Never"

Our model combines kernel estimation with clustering, to obtain a semiparametric probability mass function estimate which summarizes -- rather than contains -- the training data. Because the model is cluster based, it is inferable from a limited set of training data, despite the model's high dimensionality. Moreover, its functional form allows recursive implementation that avoids exponential growth in required memory as the number of dimensions increases. Experimental results are presented for each of the three applications considered."

Our modeling approach, which combines both geometry-based and imagebased techniques, has two components. The first component is a photogrammetricmodeling method which facilitates the recovery of the basic geometry of the photographed scene. Our photogrammetric modeling approach is effective, convenient, and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic of architectural scenes. The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which recovers how the real scene deviates from the basic model. By making use of the model, our stereo technique robustly recovers accurate depth from widely-spaced image pairs. Consequently, our approach can model large architectural environments with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. For producing renderings, we present view-dependent texture mapping, a method of compositing multiple views of a scene that better simulates geometric detail on basic models. Our approach can be used to recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering systems. We present results that demonstrate our approach\u2019s ability to create realistic renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs.
