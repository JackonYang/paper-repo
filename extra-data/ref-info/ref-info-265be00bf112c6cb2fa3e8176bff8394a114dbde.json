We propose a new method called Knowledge\u2010Based Extended Boolean Model (kb\u2010ebm) in which Salton's extended Boolean model is incorporated. kb\u2010ebm evaluates weighted queries and documents effectively, and avoids the problems of the previous methods. kb\u2010ebm provides high quality document rankings by using term dependence information from is\u2010a hierarchies The performance experiments show that the proposed method closely simulates human behaviour."

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be."

Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like 'cause', are used, distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgements of distance significantly correlate with the distance judgements that people make and help to determine whether one semantic net is better or worse than another. The authors focus on the mathematical characteristics of distance that presents novel cases and interpretations. Experiments in which distance is applied to pairs of concepts and to sets of concepts in a hierarchical knowledge base show the power of hierarchical relations in representing information about the conceptual distance between concepts. >"

For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership, where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\") and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing."

A formula called DISTANCE was developed to measure the conceptual distance between queries and documents encoded as sets of thesaurus terms. DISTANCE references MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and assesses the degree of match between a MeSH-encoded query and document. The performance of DISTANCE on MeSH is compared to the performance of people in the assessment of conceptual distance between queries and documents, and is found to simulate with surprising accuracy the human performance. The power of the computer simulation stems both from the tendency of people to rely heavily on broader-than (BT) relations in making decisions about conceptual distance and from the thousands of accurate BT relations in MeSH. One source for discrepancy between the algorithms' measurement of closeness between query and document and people's measurement of closeness between query and document is occasional inconsistency in the BT relations. Our experiments with adding non-BT relations to MeSH showed how these non-BT non-BT relations to MeSH showed how these non-BT relations could improve document ranking, if DISTANCE were also appropriately revised to treat these relations differently from BT relations."

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

First, search for relevant documents returns irrelevant items when all meanings of a search term are used, rather than just the meaning intended. This causes low precision. Second, relevant items are missed when they are indexed not under the actual search terms, but rather under related terms. This causes low recall. With semantics-free approaches there is generally no way to improve both precision and recall at the same time. Word sense disambiguation during document indexing should improve precision. We have investigated using the massive Word Net semantic network for disambigu at ion during indexing. With the unconstrained text of the SMART ret rieval environment, we have had to derive our own content description from the input text, given only part-ofspeech tagging of the input. We employ the notion of semantic distance between network nodes. Input text terms with multiple senses are disambiguated by finding the combination of senses from a set of contiguous terms which minimizes total pairwise dist ante between senses. Results so far have been encouraging. Improvement in disamblguation compared with chance is clear"

The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967) proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure and processing into a computer."

But a frequent objection to this solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming.

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"
