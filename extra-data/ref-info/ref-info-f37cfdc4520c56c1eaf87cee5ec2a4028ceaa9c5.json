In this work, HMM conditional independence assumptions are relaxed in a principled way. For each hidden state value, additional dependencies are added between observation elements to increase both accuracy and discriminability. These additional dependencies are chosen according to natural statistical dependencies extant in training data that are not well modeled by an HMM. The result is called a buried Markov model (BMM) because the underlying Markov chain in an HMM is further hidden (buried) by specific cross-observation dependencies. Gaussian mixture HMMs are extended to represent BMM dependencies and new EM update equations are derived. On preliminary experiments with a large-vocabulary isolated-word speech database, BMMs are able to achieve an 11% improvement in WER with only a 9.5% increase in the number of parameters using a single state per mono-phone speech recognition system."

Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. We present an efficient framework for estimating these models that ensures scalability and generality. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, a phone error rate of 23.0% was recorded on the full test set, a significant improvement over comparable HMM-based systems."

This problem can be relieved by composing a triphone model from less context-dependent models. This paper introduces a new statistical framework, derived from the Bayesian principle, to perform such a composition. The potential power of this new framework is explored, both algorithmically and experimentally, by an implementation with hidden Markov modeling techniques. This implementation is applied to the recognition of the 39-phone set on the TIMIT database. The new model achieves 74.4% and 75.6% accuracy, respectively, on the core and complete test sets."

The hidden Markov model (HMM) framework is used to provide the recognition algorithm, which assumes that the underlying Markov chain tracks the temporal evolution of the features. It is shown that this approach can naturally accommodate such coarticulatory effects as feature spreading and formant transition in the functionality of the recognizer, and can provide a high degree of acoustic data sharing that makes effective use of training data. Use of phonetic features as the basic speech units creates a framework where the Markov model's state topology in the recognizer can be designed with guidance of detailed speech knowledge. Details of such a design for a stop consonant-vowel vocabulary are described. Experimental results on the task of speaker-dependent stop consonant discrimination, evaluated from speech data from a total of ten male and five female speakers, demonstrate effectiveness of this feature-based recognizer. Over the 15 speakers, the error rates were shown to be reduced by 23%, 37%, 42%, and 38%, respectively, compared with the conventional HMM-based recognition methods using words, phonemes, allophones, and microsegments as the primary speech units."

Analogous to structured language models where syntactic structure is exploited to represent long-distance relationships among words , the structured speech model described in this paper makes use of the dynamic structure in the hidden vocal tract resonance space to characterize long-span contextual influence among phonetic units. A general overview is provided first on hierarchically classified types of dynamic speech models in the literature. A detailed account is then given for a specific model type called the hidden trajectory model, and we describe detailed steps of model construction and the parameter estimation algorithms. We show how the use of resonance target parameters and their temporal filtering enables joint modeling of long-span coarticulation and phonetic reduction effects. Experiments on phonetic recognition evaluation demonstrate superior recognizer performance over a modern hidden Markov model-based system. Error analysis shows that the greatest performance gain occurs within the sonorant speech class"

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10\u201316%."

We offer two different alternatives \u2013 automatically derived s ubword units and linguistically motivated distinctive feature sys tems \u2013 and discuss current work in these directions.

The formulation of this generalized HTM is presented in the generative-modeling framework, enabling efficient computation of the joint likelihood for both static and delta cepstral sequences as the acoustic features given the model. The parameter estimation techniques for the new model are developed and presented, giving closed-form estimation formulas after the use of vector Taylor series approximation. We show principled generalization from the earlier static-cepstra HTM to the new static/delta-cepstra HTM not only in terms of model formulations but also in terms of their respective analytical forms in (monophone) parameter estimation. Experimental results on the standard TIMIT phonetic recognition task demonstrate recognition accuracy improvement over the earlier best HTM system, both significantly better than state-of-the-art triphone HMM systems."

In order to assess the viability of this approach, we benchmark our performance on broad class recognition against a range of HMM-based approaches using the CMU Sphinx 3 system.

In the model, the global nonstationarity is embodied through an underlying Markov chain that governs evolution of the parameters in a set of output stochastic processes. The local nonstationarity is realized by utilizing state-conditioned, time-varying first- and second-order statistics in the output data-generation process models. For potential uses in automatic uncovering of relationally invariant properties from the speech signal and in speech recognition, the local nonstationarity is represented in a parametric form.

Large margin GMMs have many parallels to support vector machines (SVMs) but use ellipsoids to model classes instead of half-spaces. Model parameters are trained discriminatively to maximize the margin of correct classification, as measured in terms of Mahalanobis distances. The required optimization is convex over the model's parameter space of positive semidefinite matrices and can be performed efficiently. Large margin GMMs are naturally suited to large problems in multiway classification; we apply them to phonetic classification and recognition on the TIMIT database. On both tasks, we obtain significant improvement over baseline systems trained by maximum likelihood estimation. For the problem of phonetic classification, our results are competitive with other state-of-the-art classifiers, such as hidden conditional random fields"

In this model, high-level linguistic constraints are incorporated in automatic construction of the patterns of feature-overlapping and of the hidden Markov model (HMM) states induced by such patterns. The main linguistic information explored includes word and phrase boundaries, morpheme, syllable, syllable constituent categories, and word stress. A consistent computational framework developed for the construction of the feature-based model and the major components of the model are described.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2). The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them."

The top-level model is a third-order Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under different lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error."

The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efficient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model finds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during motion capture."

Common approaches use finite state machines or other methods similar to conventional machine translation. Instead of using conventional NLP techniques, the approach presented here builds on deep belief networks, a technique which was shown to work well for other machine learning problems. We show that deep belief networks have certain properties which are very interesting for transliteration and possibly also for translation and that a combination with conventional techniques leads to an improvement over both components on an Arabic-English transliteration task."

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."
