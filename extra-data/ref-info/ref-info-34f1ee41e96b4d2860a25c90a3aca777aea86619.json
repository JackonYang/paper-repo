Initially, Pi ODA extracts a part-of hierarchy of nested layout objects such as text-blocks, lines, and words based on their presentation on the page. Subsequently, in a step called logical labeling, the layout objects and their compositions are geometrically analyzed to identify corresponding logical objects that can be related to a human perceptible meaning, such as sender, recipient, and date in a letter. A context-sensitive text recognition for logical objects is then applied using logical vocabularies and syntactic knowledge. As a result, Pi ODA produces a document representation that conforms to the ODA international standard.<<ETX>>"

In Gobbledoc, image processing, document analysis, and OCR operations take place in batch mode when the documents are acquired. The document image acquisition process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>"

The individual classifiers differ strongly in their basic assumptions: While the first one considers layout and typographic information with respect to certain keywords the second one is a more conventional text categorization approach which merely incorporates textual features. Since this whole categorization tool is embedded into a document analysis system, a highly precise classification is essential for a subsequent goal-directed extraction of structured information aimed at the integration of the document into the current business workflow of a company."

The encoding includes attributes of document logical structure as well as layout structure constraints. The encoding of document style is used to augment the processes of page segmentation, layout analysis, and character recognition. This paper describes the process of specifying logical structure and effect of imposing stylistic limitations on page layout. The resulting recognition process is more accurate and faster than the unassisted version. Recognition results are enhanced by incorporating into the output representation information on the logical structure."

A character hypotheses lattice (CHL) serves as input which is compared with the words of the vocabulary, using a generalization of the weighted edit distance. The search for the best word is based on a depth first traversal through the paths of the CHL and is directed by several heuristics to achieve a reasonable processing speed without deteriorating the recognition rate significantly. An iterative supervised automatic learning algorithm is proposed which determines the costs for the edit operations. Experiments reveal that this method significantly improves the recognition accuracy."

Due to the lack of a layout model of all possible invoices the system is composed of several processing stages. These stages are: text stripe extraction and skew detection by a combination of mathematical morphology and heuristic search; orientation detection by a new approach called \\row-delta-histogram\"; the optical character recognition of text stripes using a multilayer backpropagation network as a classi er and fractal based Peano features; table extraction which uses a genetic algorithm to adapt a suitable table row template; price entry extraction by using the context of optical character recognition. Also, the system comprises further functionalities, to name a few: reprocessing of all processing stages with di erent parameter settings, font typeface estimation and evaluation of divider information. The system runs as a C++ class library under the OS/2 operating system and shows encouraging recognition results."

Most of the OCR systems can recognize only black characters on white uniform background or vice versa. Overlapping text with background noise regions can be directly opened with an appropriate structuring element to remove the background components that touch the characters. But applying such methods globally to a document image will reduce the quality of the \"clean\" text (i.e. text on uniform white background) and the character recognition accuracy will rapidly decrease. An efficacious and simple approach is to distinguish between the \"noisy\" text regions where such cleaning and enhancing overhead is needed and the \"clean\" text regions where an OCR device already yields good recognition results. The author focuses on the topic of detecting noise regions and presents an objective evaluation method. As an example it is used to evaluate a standard noise cleaning method in document images."
