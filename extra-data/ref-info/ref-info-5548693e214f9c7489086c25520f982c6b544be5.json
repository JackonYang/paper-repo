Nevertheless, there are natural and simple situations in which the forward-backward algorithm will be inadequate for its intended purpose of finding useful maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the distribution of a probabilistic function of a Markov chain (a \"hidden Markov model\" or \"Markov source model\"). We observe some difficulties that arise in the case of common (e.g., Gaussian) families of conditional distributions for the observables. These difficulties are due not to the algorithm itself, but to modeling assumptions which introduce singularities into the likelihood function. We also comment on the fact that the parameters of a hidden Markov model cannot, in general, be determined, even if the distribution of the observables is completely known. We close with remarks about some effects of these modeling and estimating difficulties on practical speech recognition, and about the role of initial statistics."

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

Closed-form expressions are derived for the root mean square (rms) spectral deviation due to variations in one, two, or multiple parameters. For one-parameter variation, the reflection coefficients, log area ratios, and inverse sine coefficients are studied. It is shown that, depending upon the criterion chosen, either log area ratios or inverse sine quantization can be viewed as optimal. From a practical point of view, it is shown experimentally that very little difference exists among the various quantization methods beyond the second coefficient. Two-parameter variations are studied in terms of formant frequency and bandwidth movement and in terms of a two-pair quantization scheme. A lower bound on the number of quantization levels required to satisfy a given maximum spectral deviation is derived along with the two-pair quantization scheme which approximately satisfies the bound. It is shown theoretically that the two-pair quantization scheme has a 10-bit superiority over other above-mentioned quantization schemes in the sense of theoretically assuring that a maximum overall log spectral deviation will not be exceeded."

To get an appreciation for the robustness of this feature set, an experimental investigation was undertaken to vary each of the parameters of the analysis system, and to measure the effect of recognition accuracy. The parameters chosen for study included\u2014N, the size of the analysis frame; L, the shift between frames; p the number of LPC poles; \u03b1, the preemphasis factor, and LP, the analog filter cutoff.

In particular, we would like to determine whether hardware implementations could be simplified by reducing computation and memory requirements without significantly degrading overall system performance. The effects of system bandwidth (both in training and testing the recognizer) on the performance must also be considered since the conditions under which the system is used may be different than those under which it was trained. Finally, we must take account of the effects of finite word-length implementations, on both the computation of features and of distances, for the system to properly operate. In this paper we present the results of a study to determine the effects on recognition error rate of varying the basic analysis parameters of a linear predictive coding (LPC) model of speech. The results showed that system performance was best with an analysis parameter set equivalent to what is currently being used in the computer simulations, and that variations in parameter values that reduced computation also degraded performance, whereas variations in parameter values that increased computation did not lead to improved performance."
