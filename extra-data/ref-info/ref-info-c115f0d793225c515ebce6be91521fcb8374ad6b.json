Note however that the augmented state vector X contains the gamma state variables y 1,...,yK, basically (dispersively) delayed neural states. As a result, although associative learning rules for conventional additive models only encode the simultaneous correlation of neural states, the gamma learning rules are able to encode temporal associations as well. Here we present Hebbian learning for the gamma model. The Hebbian postulate is often mathematically translated to a learning rule of the form , where is a learning rate constant, the neural activation vector and the neuron output signal vector. This procedure is not likely to encode temporal order, since information about past states is not incorporated in the learning equations. Tank and Hopfield (1987) proposed a generalized Hebbian learning rule with delays that can be written as -"

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

This model, the gamma neural model, is as general as a convolution delay model with arbitrary weight kernels w(t). We show that the gamma model can be formulated as a (partially prewired) additive model. A temporal hebbian learning rule is derived and we establish links to related existing models for temporal processing. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper, we are concerned with developing neural nets with short term memory for processing of temporal patterns. In the literature, basically two ways have been reported to incorporate short-term memory in the neural system equations. The first approach utilizes reverberating (self-recurrent) units of type , that hold a trace of the past neural net states x(t) or the input e(t). Elman (1988) and Jordan (1986) have successfully used this approach."
