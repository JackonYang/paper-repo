The ordinary Fourier coefficients are difficult to use as input to categorizers because they contain factors dependent upon size and rotation as well as an arbitrary phase angle. From these Fourier coefficients, however, other more useful features can easily be derived. By using these derived property constants, a distinction can be made between genuine shape constants and constants representing size, location, and orientation. The usefulness of the method has been tested with a computer program that was used to classify 175 samples of handprinted letters, e.g., 7 sets of the 25 letters A to Z. In this test, 98 percent were correctly recognized when a simple nonoptimized decision method was used. The last section contains some considerations of the technical realizability of a fast preprocessing system for reading printed text."

While this problem has been treated with considerable success relative to automatic classification of two-dimensional objects, especially with regard to recognition of printed characters, comparatively little has been achieved in automatic identification of three-dimensional objects. Generally speaking, such successes as have been attained in the latter area can be grouped under two broad headings: 1) scene analysis in which various specialized procedures are used to determine spatial relationships between simple objects such as solid polyhedra, cylinders, cones, etc., and 2) statistical pattern recognition in which certain numerical features of an image of an unknown object are used to classify it and perhaps to estimate its position and orientation [1]. This paper is addressed entirely to the second approach and is concerned with recognition of complex man- made objects rather than natural objects or simple solids."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

A characteristic property of this approach is the existence of two steps: the first step (primitive feature generation) is primarily numerical, and the second step (feature selection and classification) makes extensive use of semantics."

The containment code leads in a natural way to procedures for following the boundaries of the regions of the picture. This permits a compression of data into a linear array that can be stored for later processing or for picture reconstruction. The boundary following algorithms presented lend themselves well to hardware implementation as can be seen from an explicit sequential machine description. Related codes such as the boundary index code and the directional code are obtained from the containment code. Procedures are described for extracting various topological features such as curve length, chord length, area, and moments."

A procedure is called optimum if it has a probability of error less than a specified value and minimizes the average observations cost among all procedures with probability of error less than this specified value. This research investigates first the existence of such optimum procedures and gives algorithms to obtain them."
