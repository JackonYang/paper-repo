The resulting resource can be thought of as shallow, in that it does not represent coreference, quantification, and many other higher-order phenomena, but also broad, in that it covers every instance of every verb in the corpus and allows representative statistics to be calculated. We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus. We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty trace categories of the treebank."

However, they will experience a plateau in quality, much like other \u201csilver bullet\u201d approaches to MT. We pursue work on the development of interlingual representations for use in symbolic or hybrid MT systems. In this paper, we describe the creation of an interlingua and the development of a corpus of semantically annotated text, to be validated in six languages and evaluated in several ways. We have established a distributed, well-functioning research methodology, designed a preliminary interlingua notation, created annotation manuals and tools, developed a test collection in six languages with associated English translations, annotated some 150 translations, and designed and applied various annotation metrics. We describe the data sets being annotated and the interlingual (IL) representation language which uses two ontologies and a systematic theta-role list. We present the annotation tools built and outline the annotation process. Following this, we describe our evaluation methodology and conclude with a summary of issues that have arisen."

The resulting database will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic frames underlying the meanings of the words described, and (b) the valence representation (semantic and syntactic) of several thousand words and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a representative collection of annotated corpus attestations, which jointly exemplify the observed linkings between \"frame elements\" and their syntactic realizations (e.g. grammatical function, phrase type, and other syntactic traits).

The accuracy of the first-stage parser on the standard Parseval metric matches that of the (Collins, 2003) parser on which it is based, despite the data fragmentation caused by the greatly enriched space of possible node labels. This first stage simultaneously achieves near state-of-the-art performance on recovering function tags with minimal modifications to the underlying parser, modifying less than ten lines of code. The second stage achieves state-of-the-art performance on the recovery of empty categories by combining a linguistically-informed architecture and a rich feature set with the power of modern machine learning methods."

We investigate sources of human annotator disagreements stemming from the tagging for the English Verb Lexical Sample Task in the SENSEVAL-2 exercise in automatic Word Sense Disambiguation. We also examine errors made by a high-performing maximum entropy Word Sense Disambiguation system we developed. Both sets of errors are at least partially reconciled by a more coarse-grained view of the senses, and we present the groupings we use for quantitative coarse-grained evaluation as well as the process by which they were created. We compare the system's performance with our human annotator performance in light of both fine-grained and coarse-grained sense distinctions and show that well-defined sense groups can be of value in improving word sense disambiguation by both humans and machines."

We investigate sources of human annotator disagreements stemming from the tagging for the English Verb Lexical Sample Task in the Senseval-2 exercise in automatic Word Sense Disambiguation. We also examine errors made by a high-performing maximum entropy Word Sense Disambiguation system we developed. Both sets of errors are at least partially reconciled by a more coarse-grained view of the senses, and we present the groupings we use for quantitative coarse-grained evaluation as well as the process by which they were created. We compare the system\u2019s performance with our human annotator performance in light of both fine-grained and coarse-grained sense distinctions and show that well-defined sense groups can be of value in improving word sense disambiguation by both humans and machines."

In this paper we present a state-of-the-art baseline semantic role labeling system based on Support Vector Machine classifiers. We show improvements on this system by: i) adding new features including features extracted from dependency parses, ii) performing feature selection and calibration and iii) combining parses obtained from semantic parsers trained using different syntactic views. Error analysis of the baseline system showed that approximately half of the argument identification errors resulted from parse errors in which there was no syntactic constituent that aligned with the correct argument. In order to address this problem, we combined semantic parses from a Minipar syntactic parse and from a chunked syntactic representation with our original baseline system which was based on Charniak parses. All of the reported techniques resulted in performance improvements."

DOLCE is presented here in an intuitive way; the reader should refer to the project deliverable for a detailed axiomatization. A comparison with WordNet's top-level taxonomy of nouns is also provided, which shows how DOLCE, used in addition to the OntoClean methodology, helps isolating and understanding some major WordNet?s semantic limitations. We suggest that such analysis could hopefully lead to an ?ontologically sweetened? WordNet, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cognitively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications."
