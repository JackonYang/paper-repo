This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

For all but pathological channels the bounds are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates above R_{0} , the computational cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates above R_{0} and whose performance bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms."
