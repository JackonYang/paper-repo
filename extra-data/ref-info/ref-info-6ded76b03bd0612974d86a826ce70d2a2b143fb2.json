The present study applies quantitative methods to the examination of the axonal distributions of cortical neurons and to the afferent supply to the visual cortex of the cat. The cortex is an aggregate of neurons infiltrated by afferent axons arising from different parts of the nervous system. This aggregate may be divided into subaggregates or groups wherein membership of a particular subaggregate is determined by the distribution of the processes of the neurons. The organization of the cortex is discussed in terms of certain subaggregates and their relationships to the incoming afferent fibres. Neurons have been classified in accordance with the joint distributions of their axons and dendrites, as revealed in histological preparations made by the Golgi rapid method. These results have been compared with the neuronal density distributions found in Nissl preparations, and both relative and absolute estimates of the densities of the different types of neuron computed. The resulting neuronal organization has been further examined with reference to the afferent supply to the cortex. These results lead only to a understanding of but they supply knowledge about the number of afferent fibres, the number of efferent fibres and the quantitative relationships subsisting between these fibre groups and the cortical neurons; this knowledge is essential for progress in cortical physiology."

                "text": "IN a recent paper by Adrian & Moruzzi [1939] the electrical activity of the motor area of the brain was correlated with the discharge of impulses in the pyramidal tract. It was found that there was in general a close agreement between the larger potential waves of the cortex and the groups of impulses in the pyramidal discharge, and from this various conclusions could be drawn as to the activity of the cortical nerve cells. For further progress it seemed essential to have a survey of the sensory area made from the same point of view. A great deal is already known about the electrical activity of the various regions of the cortex which receive messages from the sense organs: the reactions of the visual area have been analysed in detail by Bartley & Bishop [1933], those of the auditory area in the cat by Bremer [1938] and of the sensory area in the monkey by Marshall, Woolsey & Bard [Bard, 1938], and general surveys have been made by Kornmiiller [1937], by Gerard, Marshall & Saul [1936] and Derbyshire, Rempel, Forbes & Lambert [1936]. Much of the present work has merely confirmed what has been done already, but the recording of nerve impulses as well as cortical potentials can add some details to the picture of events taking place in the brain, and in existing circumstances it seemed advisable to publish what had been done. The greater part was written before the appearance of two important papers by Marshall [1941] and Marshall, Woolsey & Bard [1941] covering the same field. This must excuse the absence of detailed reference to the many points of agreement and to the few discrepancies between the present results and theirs. It is scarcely necessary to point out how much the present work is indebted to their earlier paper which showed the precise localization of electrical reactions in the sensory area."

One is thought to be related to nerve fibre and the other to nerve cell.2) Responses to touch on the skin or hairs were most frequently obtained. In them, the amplitude of spikes was generally large and adaptation was very quick. Receptive areas for them were fairly localized, particularly restricted on the distal ends of limbs.3) Impulse discharges responding-to push or pull of the skin were tonic, adapting slowly. The physiological function of these afferents may be partly proprioceptive.4) Among proprioceptive afferents, which generally adapted slowly, those for muscles were far less frequently encountered than those for articular capsules or tendons.5) In Goll's funiculus, responses from tactile afferents were far more frequently obtained than those from proprioceptive afferents. The circumstances were quite opposite in regard to Burdach's funiculus. The majority of responses from the thoracic level seems to be concerned with respiratory movements of the chest.6) From a localized superficial portion of Goll's funiculus closely adjacent to the septum medianum, slowly adapting impulse discharges were obtained subsequent to filling the urinary bladder. Their spike apperances were far smaller than those for tactile afferents.7) The medio-lateral arrangement, upon the transverse section of the second cervical cord, of those parts of the body from which the responses were obtained was as follows:(a) urinary bladder, (b) tail or perineum, (c) toes of hind limbs, (d) distal half of hind limbs except toes, (e) proximal half of hind limbs, (f) loins or abdomen, (g) chest, (h) toes of fore limbs, (i) distal half of fore limbs except toes, (j) proximal half of fore limbs.8) Spontaneous impulse discharges, which were obscure in their receptive fields, were frequently recorded in the lateral half of Burdach's funiculus and in an area between Goll's and Burdach's funiculus. They are assumed to be related to slowly adapting afferents and to be proprioceptive in nature."

                "text": "The posterior articular nerve to the knee-joint of the cat carries afferent discharges which are influenced by moving the joint (Boyd, 1953a; Boyd & Roberts, 1953). Two types of discharge can be recorded. They differ particularly in the time-course of the adaptation of impulse-frequency during and after a movement of the joint: the discharges are accordingly referred to as 'slowly-adapting' and 'rapidly-adapting'. Recording from twigs of the posterior articular nerve, the slowly-adapting response is encountered much more frequently than the rapidly-adapting response. A notable feature of the slowly-adapting response is a sustained discharge at a frequency dependent on the position of the joint. Many different types of receptor have been described in the capsules of joints by Henocque (1869), Krause (1874, man), R'auber (1874, man), HagenTorn (1882, various animals), Sfameni (1902, dog), Gardner (1944, cat), and Samuel (1948, cat). These receptors, however, do not fall readily into two classes in the way one would expect from the nature of the discharges in the nerves from the joint, so a further histological study has been undertaken. Two types of receptor have been found, and in this paper it will be shown that, by a combination of histological and neurophysiological techniques, it is possible to relate the type of receptor to the character of the discharge in the related axon when the joint is moved. The staining method employed (gold chloride) is suitable for the impregnation of myelinated nerve-fibres and organized nerve-endings, and it is with these that this paper is principally concerned. It is appreciated that the capsule may contain fine nerve-fibres which are not demonstrated with gold chloride, but it is regarded as unlikely that the discharges recorded arose in"

The responses of sensory nerve endings located in the knee to position and movement of the tibia are described. The endings are slowly adapting and seem to be arranged sothat each has an arc of maximum sensitivity covering a few degrees of angular movement but these ranges are different for individual endings. The significance of this is discussed. \n \nThe medial femoro-tibial and the patellar ligaments were found to be equipped with endings which signalled tension. The responses of these endings to steady tensions were measured. \n \nAn increased intracapsular pressure was produced by injecting fluid into the synovial cavity. Simultaneous recordings of pressure and impulse traffic show that a raised pressure was a potent stimulus to slowly adapting endings in the capsule. \n \nThe articular surfaces and the synovial membrane were found insensitive to moderate mechanical and thermal stimulation."

Little is known, however, about the precise function of any of these sense-organs. This is rather surprising, in view of the importance of the joints in health, and in view of the prevalence of diseases of the joints which are both crippling and painful. The appreciation ofthe relative positions of different parts ofthe body is exceedingly precise in man, even without the help of the eyes. For example, if the eyes are closed and a small object is put down with one hand it is possible, still with the eyes closed, to pick the object up again, with either hand. Presumably the position of the hand is deduced from an assessment of the angles of the various joints. This implies that there must be available very accurate information about the relative positions of the bones forming each joint. Stopford (1921) concluded, from a study of human peripheral-nerve lesions, that, although information about movements of the fingers can be derived from endings in muscles and tendons, accurate localization of the fingers depends on afferent impulses from the phalangeal joints. Various physiological responses have from time to time been attributed to impulses in nerves from the joints. Comroe & Schmidt (1943), for example, described effects on respiration produced by passive movements of the limbs. They showed that changes in respiration could still be observed on moving the knee of the dog after cutting the tendons of surrounding muscles, and that the effect was abolished by denervating the knee-joint. The nerve-impulses producing the changes in respiration must therefore arise in the joint. Impulses from sense-organs in the joints have occasionally been observed, but the discharges have never been analysed in detail. Adrian & Umrath (1929) mentioned that they observed impulses in the sciatic nerve of a frog on movement of the knee-joint after all muscular branches of the nerve had been cut.

The tension in the muscles is certainly disturbed by the anaesthetic necessarily employed during experimental work and, apart from passive movements produced by externally applied forces, the production of normal joint movements is difficult. To avoid these difficulties, this work began with a search for a part of the knee joint unconnected to skeletal muscle which might be a source of proprioceptive information. Two sites seemed promising, the collateral ligaments and the cruciate ligaments. The medial ligament was chosen for the first trial because it is readily accessible and, as is well known, it is subjected to tension which increases during joint extension. Some initial experiments on the medial ligament have already been described (Andrew & Dodt, 1953)."

                "text": "INTRODUCTION In a recent investigation, Weddell & Zander (1950) compared and contrasted the histological methods commonly adopted for the display of neural elements in peripheral tissues, using the cornea as their testing ground and controlling their observations by phase-contrast examination of fresh untreated specimens. They found that the appearances produced depended to a significant degree on the precise technique adopted, and that no single method was of universal applicability. However, it was possible, by using the pictures obtained by silver impregnation and by methylene-blue staining to complement one another, to interpret the results in the light of the phase-contrast observations. It appeared worth while to apply this newly gained experience to the examination of preparations of human skin. The area selected was the auricle of the ear, since in this region relatively large areas of thin skin are available, resting on a minimal base of relatively homogeneous subcutaneous tissue. At the same time, the sensitivity of the auricle to the four commonly recognized modalities of sensation was assessed in terms of the sensitivity of other skin areas. There is surprisingly little precedent for an attempt to compare the sensory capacities of two areas of skin; the most recent paper is that of Hutchison, Tough & Wyburn (1948). The two control areas for the present investigation were the front of the forearm and the palmar aspect of a finger. The first of these was chosen since it has been the site of election for sensory experiments in the past, and has thus acquired the status of a standard area. The second was taken as representative of a specialized sensory region."
