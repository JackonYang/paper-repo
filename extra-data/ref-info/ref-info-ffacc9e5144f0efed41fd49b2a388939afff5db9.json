With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9], aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity map of the scene viewed."

                "text": "Recently, Marr & Poggio (1979) presented a theory of human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is presented, and consists of five steps. (i) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by delta 2G, the Laplacian of a Gaussian function. (ii) Zero crossings in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (iii) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, it can be shown that false targets pose only a simple problem. (iv) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. In this way, the matching process gradually moves from dealing with large disparities at a low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (v) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-dimensional sketch. To support the adequacy of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested on a wide range of stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. Also statistical assumptions made by Marr & Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail."

Stereo is an attractive technique for depth perception because, compared with monocular techniques, it leads to more direct, unambiguous, and quantitative depth measurements, and unlike \"active\" approaches such as radar and laser ranging, it is suitable in almost all application domains. Computational stereo is broadly defined as the recovery of the three-dimensional characteristics of a scene from multiple images taken from different points of view. First, each of the functional components of the computational stereo paradigm--image acquLsition, camera modeling, feature acquisition, image matching, depth determination, and interpolation--is identified and discussed. Then, the criteria that are important for evaluating the effectiveness of various computational stereo techniques are presented. Finally a representative sampling of computational stereo research is provided."

The ability to derive such information from remotely sensed data has application within both the military and intelligence communities. Studies of typical reconnaissance have shown that precise models can be extracted, but current methods are laborious, and rely heavily on operator insight. This work addresses development of an automatic and digital method. Attention is restricted to sites composed of planar surfaces (e.g. buildings). For an automatic stereo system, these sites present the severe problems of abrupt change in slopes and image occlusion. These features thoroughly disrupt application of traditional automatic stereo techniques, which have been developed to model rolling natural terrain. The system reported here represents an entirely new design, based on correlation but specifically structured to the problem features of planar surface sites. A demonstration is achieved, on reconnaissance imagery, of automatic stereo measurement of a building complex. This work is expected to form a basis for advanced work in both automated and computer aided stereo technique."

                "text": "In recent years, many systolic algorithms have been proposed as solutions to computationally demanding problems in signal and image processing and other areas. Such algorithms exploit the regularity and parallelism of problems to achieve high performance and low I/O requirements. Since systolic algorithms generally consist of a few types of simple processors, or systolic cells, connected in a regular pattern, they are less expensive to design and implement than more general machines.\n This advantage is offset by the fact that a particular systolic system can generally be used only on a narrow set of problems, and thus design cost cannot be amortized over a large number of units. One way to approach this problem is to provide a programmable systolic chip (PSC), many copies of which can be connected and programmed to implement many systolic algorithms.\n The systolic environment, by virtue of its emphasis on continuous, regular flow of data and fairly simple per-cell processing, imposes new design requirements for programmable processors which are quite different from those found in a general-purpose system. This paper describes the CMU PSC, a single-chip microprocessor suitable for use in groups of tens or hundreds for the efficient implementation of a broad variety of systolic arrays. The processor has been fabricated in nMOS, and is undergoing testing."

Knowledge is represented in the Hearsay- 1 system as procedures and in the Dragon system as a Markov network with a- priori transition probabilities between states. Systematic performance analysis of various design choices of these two systems resulted in the HARPY system, in which knowledge is represented as a finite state transition network but without the a-priori transition probabilities. Harpy searches only a few 'best' syntactic (and acoustic) paths in parallel to determine the optimal path, and uses segmentation to effectively reduce the utterance length, thereby reducing the number of state probability updates that must be done. Several new heuristics have been added to the HARPY system to improve its performance and speed: detection of common sub-nets and collapsing them to reduce overall network size and complexity, eliminating the need for doing an acoustic match for all phonemic types at every time sample, and semi-automatic techniques for learning the lexical representations (that are needed for a steady-state system of this type) and the phonemic templates from training data, thus automatically accounting for the commonly occurring intra-word coarticulation and juncture phenomena. Inter-word phenomena are handled by the use of juncture rules which are applied at network generation time, thereby eliminating the need for repetitive and time consuming application of phonological rules during the recognition phase."
