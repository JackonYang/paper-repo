Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs.

Automatic recognition of traffic signs is required in advanced driver assistance systems and constitutes a challenging real-world computer vision and pattern recognition problem. A comprehensive, lifelike dataset of more than 50,000 traffic sign images has been collected. It reflects the strong variations in visual appearance of signs due to distance, illumination, weather conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. The images are complemented by several precomputed feature sets to allow for applying machine learning algorithms without background knowledge in image processing. The dataset comprises 43 classes with unbalanced class frequencies. Participants have to classify two test sets of more than 12,500 images each. Here, the results on the first of these sets, which was used in the first evaluation stage of the two-fold challenge, are reported. The methods employed by the participants who achieved the best results are briefly described and compared to human traffic sign recognition performance and baseline results."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

However, they can be difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution, b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product. The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU. We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic 2.4X\u22123.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X\u22124.1X speedup."

However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over nonoverlapping pooling windows. By applying this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57% on the NORB normalized-uniform dataset and 5.6% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset."

We describe the basic parts of a CNN and demonstrate the performance and scalability improvement that can be achieved by shifting the computation-intensive tasks of a CNN to the GPU. Depending on the network topology training and classification on the GPU performs 2 to 24 times faster than on the CPU. Furthermore, the GPU version scales much better than the CPU implementation with respect to the network size."

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

One obstacle on the way towards human-like recognition performance is the limitation of computational power, restricting the size of the training and testing dataset as well as the complexity of the object recognition system. In this work, we present a hierarchical, locally-connected neural network model that is well-suited for large-scale, high-performance object recognition. By using the NVIDIA CUDA framework, we create a massively parallel implementation of the model which is executed on a state-of-the-art graphics card. This implementation is up to 82 times faster than a single-core CPU version of the system. This significant gain in computational performance allows us to evaluate the model on a very large, realistic, and challenging set of natural images which we extracted from the LabelMe dataset. To compare our model to other approaches, we also evaluate the recognition performance using the well-known MNIST and NORB datasets, achieving a testing error rate of 0.76% and 2.87 %, respectively."

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

As in the model of Serre, Wolf, and Poggio, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways. Sparsity is increased by constraining the number of feature inputs, lateral inhibition, and feature selection. We also demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Our final model is competitive with current computer vision algorithms on several standard datasets, including the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task. The results further the case for biologically-motivated approaches to object classification."

                "text": "While many models of biological object recognition share a common set of \u201cbroad-stroke\u201d properties, the performance of any one model depends strongly on the choice of parameters in a particular instantiation of that model\u2014e.g., the number of units per layer, the size of pooling kernels, exponents in normalization operations, etc. Since the number of such parameters (explicit or implicit) is typically large and the computational cost of evaluating one particular parameter set is high, the space of possible model instantiations goes largely unexplored. Thus, when a model fails to approach the abilities of biological visual systems, we are left uncertain whether this failure is because we are missing a fundamental idea or because the correct \u201cparts\u201d have not been tuned correctly, assembled at sufficient scale, or provided with enough training. Here, we present a high-throughput approach to the exploration of such parameter sets, leveraging recent advances in stream processing hardware (high-end NVIDIA graphic cards and the PlayStation 3's IBM Cell Processor). In analogy to high-throughput screening approaches in molecular biology and genetics, we explored thousands of potential network architectures and parameter instantiations, screening those that show promising object recognition performance for further analysis. We show that this approach can yield significant, reproducible gains in performance across an array of basic object recognition tasks, consistently outperforming a variety of state-of-the-art purpose-built vision systems from the literature. As the scale of available computational power continues to expand, we argue that this approach has the potential to greatly accelerate progress in both artificial vision and our understanding of the computational underpinning of biological vision."

This article considers the effects of including chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data, on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression, as well as in pattern recognition."

The network is self-organized by \u201clearning without a teacher\u201d, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \u201cneocognitron\u201d. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201cS-cells\u201d, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \u201cC-cells\u201d similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \u201cteacher\u201d during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"
