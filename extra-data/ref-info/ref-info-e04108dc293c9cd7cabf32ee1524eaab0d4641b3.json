                "text": "The purpose of this paper is to present and illustrate a new method, in fact the first method, for the nonmetric multidimensional analysis of similarity data, perhaps better to be understood as nonmetric mu$idimensional psychophysics. The method has been developed by a colleague, William Hays, at the University of Michigan, and it grew out of his thesis work on the multidimensional unfolding of preferential choice behavior (3 ) . His manuscript on this new method3 is now in preparation. First I shall say a little about the problem of similarity, the kind of data that may be involved, and the usual method of analyzing it, then I shall discuss Hays' nonmetric model and present an application of it to a Morse code confusion matrix. The problem of similarity is fundamental to many surveillance operations that involve pattern recognition. For instance, in the interpretation of optical, infra-red or radar photographs, or interpretation of received communications signals or in the judgment of military situations, officers are continually faced with the problem of making such judgments. I don't need to dwell on the general significance of the problem of similarity to psychology. Attneave, in his paper on the dimensions of similarity ( I ) , points out its use as an intervening variable in theories about perceptual organization, association, transfer, and retroactive inhibition. These very phenomena might themselves be used to define and measure similarity but then, of course, the concept cannot be used to explain the same phenomena used to define and measure it. Consequently, one finds no uniformity in the literature on this problem. A great variety of response measures can be and have been used as the source data for measuring similarity. These include: amplitude of response, latency, probability or consistency, judgment of similarity, confusion matrices, matching behavior ( Same-Diff erent ) , GSRs, and so forth. I think an essential element of what characterizes what we mean by"

They can be sampled by scanning for items at high rates of about 10 msec per letter. Recall is based on a verbal receding of the stimulus (rehearsal), which is remembered in AIS. The items retained in AIS are usually rehearsed again to prevent them from decaying. The human limits in immediate-memory (reproduction) tasks are inherent in the AIS-Rehearsal loop.
