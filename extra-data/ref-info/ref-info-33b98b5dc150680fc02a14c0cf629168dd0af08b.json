Particular emphasis was placed on designing an object representation that could: 1) cope with a large number of real 3D objects of many different types; 2) operate directly on input images without shift, scale, or other object pre-normalization steps; 3) integrate multiple visual cues; and 4) recognize objects over 6 degrees of freedom of viewpoint, gross non-rigid shape distortions, and/or partial occulsion. Recognition results were obtained using a set of 102 color and shape feature channels, each designed to be invariant to image plane shifts and rotations, and only modestly sensitive to orientation in depth. In response to a test set of 600 novel test views of 100 objects presented individually in color video images, SEEMORE identified the object correctly 97% of the time using a nearest neighbour classifier. Similar levels of performance were obtained for the subset of 15 non-rigid objects."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN."

This technique is an extension of our earlier work (1996) on object recognition using matching of multi-dimensional receptive field histograms. In the earlier paper we have shown that multi-dimensional receptive field histograms can be matched to provide object recognition which is robust in the face of changes in viewing position and independent of image plane rotation and scale. In this paper we extend this method to compute the probability of the presence of an object in an image. The paper begins with a review of the method and previously presented experimental results. We then extend the method for histogram matching to obtain a genuine probability of the presence of an object. We present experimental results on a database of 100 objects showing that the approach is capable recognizing all objects correctly by using only a small portion of the image. Our results show that receptive field histograms provide a technique for object recognition which is robust, has low computational cost and a computational complexity which is linear with the number of pixels."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

To infer relative roles of cortical areas at different stages of the ventral visual pathway, we quantitatively examined visual responses of cells in V2, V4, the posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (posterior IT), and the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), using anesthetized macaque monkeys. 2. The critical feature for the activation was first determined for each recorded cell by using a reduction method. We started from images of three-dimensional complex objects and simplified the image of effective stimuli step by step by eliminating a part of the features present in the image. The simplest feature that maximally activated the cell was determined as the critical feature. The response to the critical feature was then compared with responses of the same cell to a routine set of 32 simple stimuli, which included white and black bars of four different orientations and squares or spots of four different colors. 3. Cells that responded maximally to particular complex object features were found in posterior IT and V4 as well as in anterior IT. The cells in posterior IT and V4 were, however, different from the cells in anterior IT in that many of them responded to some extent to some simple features, that the size of the receptive field was small, and that they intermingled in single penetrations with cells that responded maximally to some simple features. The complex critical features in posterior IT and V4 varied; they consisted of complex shapes, combinations of a shape and texture, and combinations of a shape and color. 4. We suggest that local neuronal networks in V4 and posterior IT play an essential role in the formation of selective responses to complex object features."

To reveal neuronal mechanisms of this invariance, we recorded activities from single cells in the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), determined the critical features for the activation of individual cells, and examined the effects of changes in stimulus size and position on the responses. 2. Twenty-one percent of the anterior IT cells studied here responded to ranges of size > 4 octaves, whereas 43% responded to size ranges < 2 octaves. The optimal stimulus size, measured by the distance between the outer edges along the longest axis of the stimulus, ranged from 1.7 to 30 degrees. 3. The selectivity for shape was mostly preserved over the entire range of effective size and over the receptive field, whereas some subtle but statistically significant changes were observed in one half of the cells studied here. 4. The size-specific responses observed in 43% of the cells are consistent with recent psychophysical data that suggest that images of objects are stored in a size-specific manner in the long-term memory.

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \u201cdetectors\u201d for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

The model consists of nine layers of cells. The authors demonstrate that the model can be trained to recognize handwritten Arabic numerals even with considerable deformations in shape. A learning-with-a-teacher process is used for the reinforcement of the modifiable synapses in the new large-scale model, instead of the learning-without-a-teacher process applied to a previous model.

The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea. Both are extensions to contemporaneous functions of the knowing of universals heretofore treated by the authors only with respect to sequence in time."

This circuit, which could act as either an imprinting or rehearsal mechanism, may actually consist of two parallel circuits, one involving the amygdala and the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, and the other the hippocampus and the anterior nuclei. The stimulus representation stored in cortex by action of these circuits is seen as mediating three different memory processes: recognition, which occurs when the stored representation is reactivated via the original sensory pathway; recall, when it is reactivated via any other pathway; and association, when it activates other stored representations (sensory, affective, spatial, motor) via the outputs of the higher-order sensory areas to the relevant structures."

The concluding chapter describes an autonomous system that builds from experience an internal model of the world and bases its operation on that internal model. Close attention is paid to the engineering of the memory, including comparisons to ordinary computer memories. \nSparse Distributed Memory provides an overall perspective on neural systems. The model it describes can aid in understanding human memory and learning, and a system based on it sheds light on outstanding problems in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Applications of the memory are expected to be found in the creation of adaptive systems for signal processing, speech, vision, motor control, and (in general) robots. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the memory, in its implications for research in neural networks, is that its realization with neuronlike components resembles the cortex of the cerebellum. \nPentti Kanerva is a scientist at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at the NASA Ames Research Center and a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center for the Study of Language and Information.

Data were obtained while the animals were performing a paired-associate task. The task utilized five stimuli and eight stimulus pairings (4 correct and 4 incorrect). Data were evaluated as average spike rate during experimental epochs of 100 or 400 ms. Single-unit and population characteristics were measured using a form of linear discriminant analysis and information theoretic measures. To evaluate the significance of covariance on population code measures, additional data consisting of simultaneous recordings from < or = 8 isolated neurons (n = 37) were obtained from a third macaque monkey that was passively viewing visual stimuli. 2. On average, 43% of IT neurons were activated by any of the stimuli used (60% if those inhibited also are included). Yet the neurons were rather unique in the relative magnitude of their responses to each stimulus in the test set. These results suggest that information may be represented in IT by the pattern of activity across neurons and that the representation is not sparsely coded. It is further suggested that the representation scheme may have similarities to DNA or computer codes wherein a coding element is not a local parametric descriptor. This is a departure from the V1 representation, which appears to be both local and parametric. It is also different from theories of IT representation that suggest a constructive basis set or \"alphabet\". From this view, determination of stimulus discrimination capacity in IT should be evaluated by measures of population activity patterns. 3. Evaluation of small groups of simultaneously recorded neurons obtained during a fixation task suggests that little information about visual stimuli is conveyed by covariance of activity in IT when a 100-ms time scale is used as in this study. This finding is consistent with a prior report, by Gochin et al., which used a 1-ms time scale and failed to find neural activity coherence or oscillations dependent on stimuli. 4. Population-stimulus-discrimination capacity measures were influenced by the number of neurons and to some extent the number and type of stimuli. 5. Information conveyed by individual neurons (mutual information) averaged 0.26 bits. The distribution of information values was unimodal and is therefore more consistent with a distributed than a local coding scheme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In this way responses to complex stimulus patterns evoking good, poor, and midrange responses could be compared across the cell population. 2. Cells exhibiting both good and poor initial discrimination between head views were found at short and long latencies; there was no correlation of any of the temporal response parameters measured with cell response latency. 3. The time course of the population response to the most effective stimuli showed a rapid increase to a peak firing rate (onset to peak, rise time, 58 ms) that was on average 115 spikes/s above spontaneous activity (S/A), followed by slower decay (decay time, 93 ms) to a maintained discharge rate (15% of the peak rate above S/A). 4. Discrimination between responses to different head views exhibited by the population showed a sharp rise and reached highly significant levels within 25 ms after the population's response onset. 5. On average, activity in a single neuron (the Average Cell) rises to 44% of its peak response rate within 5 ms of the response onset. 6. The Average Cell also showed exceptionally fast discrimination between views, significant within 5 ms of response onset. 7. It is argued that the fast rise in firing rate, followed by a decay to a lower rate and the very fast emergence of discrimination are features of pattern processing present in real neural systems that are lacking in many processing models based on artificial networks of neuronlike elements, particularly those where discrimination relies on top-down and/or lateral competitive inhibition. 8. It is concluded that the only way to account for the rapid discrimination is to consider a coding system in which the first spike from multiple sources is used to transmit information between stages of processing."

Closeness is usually de \u0304ned in terms of a metric distance on the Euclidean space with the input measurement variables as axes. The metric chosen to de \u0304ne this distance can strongly e\u00aeect performance. An optimal choice depends on the problem at hand as characterized by the respective class distributions on the input measurement space, and within a given problem, on the location of the unknown object in that space. In this paper new types of K-nearest-neighbor procedures are described that estimate the local relevance of each input variable, or their linear combinations, for each individual point to be classi \u0304ed. This information is then used to separately customize the metric used to de \u0304ne distance from that object in  \u0304nding its nearest neighbors. These procedures are a hybrid between regular K-nearest-neighbor methods and tree-structured recursive partitioning techniques popular in statistics and machine learning."
