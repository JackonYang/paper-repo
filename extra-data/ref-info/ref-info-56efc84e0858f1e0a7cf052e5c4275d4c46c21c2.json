                "text": "In this thesis I develop a method for recognizing isolated handprinted digits using trainable deformable models. Each digit is modelled by a cubic B-spline whose basic shape is defined by the \"home\" positions of the control points. A Gaussian distribution over displacements of the control points away from their home locations defines a probability distribution over shapes. The quality of the match of a spline model to an image is calculated as the likelihood of the data under a mixture of Gaussian \"ink generators\" placed along the length of the spline. Each spline model is adjusted to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the model and the likelihood of the data, using a elastic matching procedure which is a generalization of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. I show that the matching procedure can be significantly speeded up by using a neural net to provide better starting points for the search. \nThe use of deformable models has a number of advantages. (1) After identifying the model most likely to have generated the data, the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters. I have shown that these can be used to detect writing style consistency within a string of digits. (2) During the process of explaining the image, generative models can perform recognition-driven segmentation. (3) Unlike many other recognition schemes the method does not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. The main disadvantage of the method is it requires much more computation than more standard optical character recognition techniques."

We have described a system [8] that uses learned digit models consisting of splines whose shape is governed by a small number of control points. Images can be classi ed by separately tting each digit model to the image, and using a simple neural network to decide which model ts best. We use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The use of multiple models for each digit can characterize the population of handwritten digits better. We show how multiple models may be used without increasing the time required for elastic matching."

For each known digit, the control points have preferred \"home\" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image. The digit models learn by modifying the home locations of the control points."

When the extraction process of such rules is done by hand, these approaches are generally difficult to design. The statistical methods use degenerated image descriptions of the digit which consist mainly of feature vectors. The decision zone learning in the corresponding vectorial space allows vector clusterization. In such techniques, the system recognition result is directly related to the chosen measure of vector relevance. This choice is difficult and no completely satisfactory solution exists in this domain. In order to overcome the drawbacks of these methods, the author has evaluated an elastic matching algorithm. This approach models and quantifies the distortions undergone by the digit to be recognized as compared with the theoretical and ideal pattern. Consequently, there is neither obligation of a decision rule elaboration nor a need for feature vector design. The author describes the principles of the elastic matching algorithm and analyzes its performance when run on a reference set.<<ETX>>"

For example, at one time one of our best performing digit classifiers interpreted a horizontal bar as a 2; in this example the most useful response would be to reject the image as unclassifiable.

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy. The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features: it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping handprinted numerals."

The resulting multiple-expert system proves that the consensus of these methods tends to compensate for individual weaknesses, while preserving individual strengths. It is shown that it is possible to reduce the substitution rate to a desired level while maintaining a fairly high recognition rate in the classification of totally unconstrained handwritten ZIP code numerals. If reliability is of the utmost importance, substitutions can be avoided completely (reliability=100%) while retaining a recognition rate above 90%.

The scores are given by neural net outputs for each segment. A significant advantage of the method is that the labor required to segment images manually is eliminated.

This study, however, demonstrates that these networks, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and k nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers, all provide similar low error rates on a large handwritten digit database. The backpropagation network is overall superior in memory usage and classification time but can provide false positive classifications when the input is not a digit. The backpropagation network also has the longest training time. The RBF classifier requires more memory and more classification time, but less training time. When high accuracy is warranted, the RBF classifier can generate a more effective confidence judgment for rejecting ambiguous inputs. The simple kNN classifier can also perform handwritten digit recognition, but requires a prohibitively large amount of memory and is much slower at classification. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the algorithm and fast training characteristics makes the kNN classifier an attractive candidate in hardware-assisted classification tasks. These results on a large, high input dimensional problem demonstrate that practical constraints including training time, memory usage, and classification time often constrain classifier selection more strongly than small differences in overall error rate."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

Computational feasibility of the algorithms derived from this model is achieved by analytical means. The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

This problem is to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information extraction process is broken down into two steps: a signal processing step which converts a speech waveform into a sequence of information bearing acoustic feature vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. This thesis is primarily concerned with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which lie in a continuous space such as R sub N. It explores the trade-off between packing a lot of information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately. The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous parameter sequences is addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is specifically designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions."

It is based on an elastic model which has the iterative and co-operative properties of relaxation labelling, while not requiring large storage space for label updating. At each iteration some of the mutual differences between image pairs are removed, making the association between the new pairs more reliable. The experiments described show that mismatches decrease with each iteration, and thus the reliability of both local and global matches is increased. The method is co-operative because a feature at one location influences decisions made in its surrounding area. Nearest neighbour relationships are used to derive local difference vectors between features. These vectors are combined in a weighted averaging scheme to produce corrected difference vectors which are then applied to an image to create a new image for further matching. An FFT based technique has been developed to enhance the efficiency of the corrected difference vector evaluation. The method has been found to be efficient and cost effective for 2-dimensional image matching."

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways."

Input to the system consists of any digitized radiographic data. Computer assisted tomographic (CAT) scans of the head were used in this first implementation. Using these data and a predefined atlas picture representing an idealized view of the average normal image, an individualized atlas was created. From the individualized atlas, structure size, density, location displacement, and distortion may be calculated. The individualized atlas created using high resolution data, such as the CAT scan, may then be directly superimposed on pictures obtained using lower resolution modalities, such as positron emission tomographic scan images. This allows the precise location of structures poorly visualized by the secondary imaging modality. This system is capable of using either two- or three-dimensional data."

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling."

In this framework, the overall aims are to find models that are well matched to the data, and to use these models to make optimal predictions. Neural network learning is interpreted as an inference of the most probable parameters for the model, given the training data. The search in model space (i.e., the space of architectures, noise models, preprocessings, regularizers, and weight decay constants) also then can be treated as an inference problem, in which we infer the relative probability of alternative models, given the data. This provides powerful and practical methods for controlling, comparing, and using adaptive network models. This chapter describes numerical techniques based on Gaussian approximations for implementation of these methods."

Given the positions of N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

                "text": "Lecture Notes for the MSc/DTC module. The brain is a complex computing machine which has evolved to give the ttest output to a given input. Neural computation has as goal to describe the function of the nervous system in mathematical and computational terms. By analysing or simulating the resulting equations, one can better understand its function, research how changes in parameters would eect the function, and try to mimic the nervous system in hardware or software implementations. Neural Computation is a bit like physics, that has been successful in describing numerous physical phenomena. However, approaches developed in those elds not always work for neural computation, because: 1. Physical systems are best studied in reduced, simplied circumstances, but the nervous system is hard to study in isolation. Neurons require a narrow range of operating conditions (temperature, oxygen, presence of other neurons, ion concentrations, ...) under which they work as they should. These conditions are hard to reproduce outside the body. Secondly, the neurons form a highly interconnected network. The function of the nervous systems depends on this connectivity and interaction, by trying to isolate the components, you are likely to alter the function. 2. It is not clear how much detail one needs to describe the computations in the brain. In these lectures we shall see various description levels. 3. Neural signals and neural connectivity are hard to measure, especially, if disturbance and damage to the nervous system is to be kept minimal. Perhaps Neural Computation has more in common with trying to gure out how a complicated machine, such as a computer or car works. Knowledge of the basic physics helps, but is not sucient. Luckily there are factors which perhaps make understanding the brain easier than understanding an arbitrary complicated machine: 1. There is a high degree of conservation across species. This means that animal studies can be used to gain information about the human brain. Furthermore, study of, say, the visual system might help to understand the auditory system. 2. The nervous system is able to develop by combining on one hand a only limited amount of genetic information and, on the other hand, the input it receives. Therefore it might be possible to nd the organising principles and develop a brain from there. This would be easier than guring out the complete 'wiring diagram'. 3. The nervous system is exible and robust, neurons die everyday. This stands \u2026"

The elastic net approach jointly minimizes the length of an arbitrary path in the plane and the distance between the path points and the cities. The tradeoff between these two requirements is controlled by a scale parameter K. A global minimum is found for large K, and is then tracked to a small value. In this paper, we show that (1) in the small K limit the elastic path passes arbitrarily close to all the cities, but that only one path point is attracted to each city, (2) in the large K limit the net lies at the center of the set of cities, and (3) at a critical value of K the energy function bifurcates. We also show that this method can be interpreted in terms of extremizing a probability distribution controlled by K. The minimum at a given K corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimate of the tour under a natural statistical interpretation. The analysis presented in this paper gives us a better understanding of the behavior of the elastic net, allows us to better choose the parameters for the optimization, and suggests how to extend the underlying ideas to other domains."

Calciclastic submarine fans are consequently rarely described and are poorly understood. Subsequently, very little is known especially in mud-dominated calciclastic submarine fan systems. Presented in this study are a sedimentological core and petrographic characterisation of samples from eleven boreholes from the Lower Carboniferous of Bowland Basin (Northwest England) that reveals a >250 m thick calciturbidite complex deposited in a calciclastic submarine fan setting. Seven facies are recognised from core and thin section characterisation and are grouped into three carbonate turbidite sequences. They include: 1) Calciturbidites, comprising mostly of highto low-density, wavy-laminated bioclast-rich facies; 2) low-density densite mudstones which are characterised by planar laminated and unlaminated muddominated facies; and 3) Calcidebrites which are muddy or hyper-concentrated debrisflow deposits occurring as poorly-sorted, chaotic, mud-supported floatstones.
