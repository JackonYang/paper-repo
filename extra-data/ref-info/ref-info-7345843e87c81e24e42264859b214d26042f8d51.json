We address these issues by introducingtheStack-augmentedParser-Interpreter NeuralNetwork(SPINN),whichcombines parsing and interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of a shiftreduceparser. Ourmodelsupportsbatched computation for a speedup of up to 25\u25ca over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser can operate on unparsed data with little loss in accuracy.

Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%. It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser. The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments."

The neural probabilistic model makes use of a distributed representation of the items in the conditioning history, and is powerful in capturing long dependencies. Employing neural network based models in the syntactic based language model enables it to use efficiently the large amount of information available in a syntactic parse in estimating the next word in a string. Several scenarios of integrating neural networks in the syntactic based language model are presented, accompanied by the derivation of the training procedures involved. Experiments on the UPenn Treebank and the Wall Street Journal corpus show significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. Furthermore, comparisons with the standard and neural net based N-gram models with arbitrarily long contexts show that the syntactic information is in fact very helpful in estimating the word string probability. Overall, our neural syntactic based model achieves the best published results in perplexity and WER for the given data sets."

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

                "text": "The performance of discriminative constituent parsing relies crucially on feature engineering, and effective features usually have to be carefully selected through a painful manual process. In this paper, we propose to automatically learn a set of effective features via neural networks. Specifically, we build a feedforward neural network model, which takes as input a few primitive units (words, POS tags and certain contextual tokens) from the local context, induces the feature representation in the hidden layer and makes parsing predictions in the output layer. The network simultaneously learns the feature representation and the prediction model parameters using a back propagation algorithm. By pre-training the model on a large amount of automatically parsed data, and then fine-tuning on the manually annotated Treebank data, our parser achieves the highest F1 score at 86.6% on Chinese Treebank 5.1, and a competitive F1 score at 90.7% on English Treebank. More importantly, our parser generalizes well on cross-domain test sets, where we significantly outperform Berkeley parser by 3.4 points on average for Chinese and 2.5 points for English."

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder\u2010Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases."

Syntactic approaches seek to remedy these problems. In this paper, we take the framework for acquiring multi-level syntactic translation rules of (Galley et al., 2004) from aligned tree-string pairs, and present two main extensions of their approach: first, instead of merely computing a single derivation that minimally explains a sentence pair, we construct a large number of derivations that include contextually richer rules, and account for multiple interpretations of unaligned words. Second, we propose probability estimates and a training procedure for weighting these rules. We contrast different approaches on real examples, show that our estimates based on multiple derivations favor phrasal re-orderings that are linguistically better motivated, and establish that our larger rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over minimal rules."

The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model that utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model."

We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies.

As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation."

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation."

                "text": "Recent research has shown clear improvement in translation quality by exploiting linguistic syntax for either the source or target language. However, when using syntax for both languages (\u201ctree-to-tree\u201d translation), there is evidence that syntactic divergence can hamper the extraction of useful rules (Ding and Palmer 2005). Smith and Eisner (2006) introduced quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that treats non-isomorphic structure softly using features rather than hard constraints. Although a natural fit for translation modeling, its flexibility has proved challenging for building real-world systems. In this article, we present a tree-to-tree machine translation system inspired by quasi-synchronous grammar. The core of our approach is a new model that combines phrases and dependency syntax, integrating the advantages of phrase-based and syntax-based translation. We report statistically significant improvements over a phrase-based baseline on five of seven test sets across four language pairs. We also present encouraging preliminary results on the use of unsupervised dependency parsing for syntax-based machine translation."

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

One problem is that much of the work on discriminative methods conflates changes to the learning method with changes to the parameterization of the problem. We show how a parser can be trained with a discriminative learning method while still parameterizing the problem according to a generative probability model. We present three methods for training a neural network to estimate the probabilities for a statistical parser, one generative, one discriminative, and one where the probability model is generative but the training criteria is discriminative. The latter model outperforms the previous two, achieving state-of-the-art levels of performance (90.1% F-measure on constituents)."

We show for the first time that self-training is able to significantly improve the performance of the PCFG-LA parser, a single generative parser, on both small and large amounts of labeled training data.

An SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data. We aim to provide a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion. We present a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and better than state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers."

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases."

                "text": "We study a range of syntactic processing tasks using a general statistical framework that consists of a global linear model, trained by the generalized perceptron together with a generic beam-search decoder. We apply the framework to word segmentation, joint segmentation and POS-tagging, dependency parsing, and phrase-structure parsing. Both components of the framework are conceptually and computationally very simple. The beam-search decoder only requires the syntactic processing task to be broken into a sequence of decisions, such that, at each stage in the process, the decoder is able to consider the top-n candidates and generate all possibilities for the next stage. Once the decoder has been defined, it is applied to the training data, using trivial updates according to the generalized perceptron to induce a model. This simple framework performs surprisingly well, giving accuracy results competitive with the state-of-the-art on all the tasks we consider. The computational simplicity of the decoder and training algorithm leads to significantly higher test speeds and lower training times than their main alternatives, including log-linear and large-margin training algorithms and dynamic-programming for decoding. Moreover, the framework offers the freedom to define arbitrary features which can make alternative training and decoding algorithms prohibitively slow. We discuss how the general framework is applied to each of the problems studied in this article, making comparisons with alternative learning and decoding algorithms. We also show how the comparability of candidates considered by the beam is an important factor in the performance. We argue that the conceptual and computational simplicity of the framework, together with its language-independent nature, make it a competitive choice for a range of syntactic processing tasks and one that should be considered for comparison by developers of alternative approaches."

Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality. Most NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates. With fewer heuristics, an objective evaluation in two differing test domains showed the proposed method improved performance compared to previous methods. Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness and overall preferred it to the other systems.."

First, to resolve the error propagation problem of the traditional pipeline approach, we incorporate POS tagging into the syntactic parsing process. Second, to alleviate the negative influence of size differences among competing action sequences, we align parser states during beam-search decoding. Third, to enhance the power of parsing models, we enlarge the feature set with non-local features and semisupervised word cluster features. Experimental results show that these modifications improve parsing performance significantly. Evaluated on the Chinese TreeBank (CTB), our final performance reaches 86.3% (F1) when trained on CTB 5.1, and 87.1% when trained on CTB 6.0, and these results outperform all state-of-the-art parsers."

The parser uses a basic bottom-up shift-reduce algorithm, but employs a classifier to determine parser actions instead of a grammar. This can be seen as an extension of the deterministic dependency parser of Nivre and Scholz (2004) to full constituent parsing. We show that, with an appropriate feature set used in classification, a very simple one-path greedy parser can perform at the same level of accuracy as more complex parsers. We evaluate our parser on section 23 of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, and obtain precision and recall of 87.54% and 87.61%, respectively."

To our knowledge the earliest neural network model that processed temporal information was that of MeCulloch and Pitts [McCulloch43]. Kleene [Kleene56] extended this work to show the equivalence of finite automata and McCulloch and Pitts' representation of nerve net activity. Minsky [Minsky67] showed that any hard-threshold neural network could represent a finite state automata and developed a method for actually constructing a neural network finite state automata. However, many different neural network models can be defined as recurrent; for example see [Grossberg82] and [Hopfield82]. Our focus is on discrete-time recurrent neural networks that dynamically process temporal information and follows in the tradition of dynamically (nonautonomous) recurrent network models defined by [Elman90, Jordan86, Narendra90, Pollack91,Tsoi94]. In particular this paper develops a new model, a neural network pushdown automaton (NNPDA), which is a hybrid system that couples a recurrent network to an external stack memory. More importantly, a NNPDA should be capable of learning and recognizing some class of context-free grammars. As such, this model is a significant extension of previous work where neural network finite state automata simulated and learned regular grammars. We explore the capabilities of such a model by inferring automata from sample strings the problem of grammatical inference. It is important to note that our focus is only on that of inference, not of prediction or translation. We will be concerned with problem of inferring an unknown system model based on observing sample strings and not on predicting the next string dement in a sequence. In some ways, our problem can be thought of as one of system identification [Ljung87]."

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

All of the commonly used statistical parsers use context-free dynamic programming algorithms and as such work bottom up on the entire sentence. Thus they only find a complete fully connected parse at the very end. In contrast, both subjective and experimental evidence show that people understand a sentence word-to-word as they go along, or close to it. The constraint that the parser keeps one or more fully connected syntactic trees is intended to operationalize this cognitive fact. Our parser achieves a new best result for top-down parsers of 89.4%, a 20% error reduction over the previous single-parser best result for parsers of this type of 86.8% (Roark, 2001). The improved performance is due to embracing the very large feature set available in exchange for giving up dynamic programming."

In our experiments, hierarchical pruning greatly accelerates parsing with no loss in empirical accuracy. Second, we compare various inference procedures for state-split PCFGs from the standpoint of risk minimization, paying particular attention to their practical tradeoffs.

The primary idea is that of treating the \u201cmodel as data\u201d, which is not a particular method, but a paradigm and a research methodology. Our argument is that lexicalized statistical parsing models have become increasingly complex, and therefore require thorough scrutiny, both to achieve the scientific aim of understanding what has been built thus far, and to achieve both the scientific and engineering goal of using that understanding for progress. In this thesis, we take a particular, dominant type of parsing model and perform a macro analysis, to reveal its core (and design a software engine that modularizes the periphery), and we also crucially perform a detailed analysis, which provides for the first time a window onto the efficacy of specific parameters. These analyses have not only yielded insight into the core model, but they have also enabled the identification of \u201cinefficiencies\u201d in our baseline model, such that those inefficiencies can be reduced to form a more compact model, or exploited for finding a better-estimated model with higher accuracy, or both."

However, since no large-scale bracketed corpora are available to the public, these tools are trained on corpora with different segmentation criteria, part-of-speech tagsets and bracketing guidelines, and therefore, comparisons are difficult. As a first step towards addressing this issue, we have been preparing a large bracketed corpus since late 1998. The first two installments of the corpus, 250 thousand words of data, fully segmented, POS-tagged and syntactically bracketed, have been released to the public via LDC (www.ldc.upenn.edu). In this paper, we discuss several Chinese linguistic issues and their implications for our treebanking efforts and how we address these issues when developing our annotation guidelines. We also describe our engineering strategies to improve speed while ensuring annotation quality."

Adding nondeterminism (parser speculation) to traditional LL and LR parsers can lead to unexpected parse-time behavior and introduces practical issues with error handling, single-step debugging, and side-effecting embedded grammar actions. This paper introduces the LL(*) parsing strategy and an associated grammar analysis algorithm that constructs LL(*) parsing decisions from ANTLR grammars. At parse-time, decisions gracefully throttle up from conventional fixed k>=1 lookahead to arbitrary lookahead and, finally, fail over to backtracking depending on the complexity of the parsing decision and the input symbols. LL(*) parsing strength reaches into the context-sensitive languages, in some cases beyond what GLR and PEGs can express. By statically removing as much speculation as possible, LL(*) provides the expressivity of PEGs while retaining LL's good error handling and unrestricted grammar actions. Widespread use of ANTLR (over 70,000 downloads/year) shows that it is effective for a wide variety of applications."

In order to obtain high accuracy on this task, thorough syntactic and semantic analysis of the two statements is needed. We introduce a method for paraphrase detection based on recursive autoencoders (RAE). Our unsupervised RAEs are based on a novel unfolding objective and learn feature vectors for phrases in syntactic trees. These features are used to measure the word- and phrase-wise similarity between two sentences. Since sentences may be of arbitrary length, the resulting matrix of similarity measures is of variable size. We introduce a novel dynamic pooling layer which computes a fixed-sized representation from the variable-sized matrices. The pooled representation is then used as input to a classifier. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging MSRP paraphrase corpus."

One important reason is the existence of unary nodes in phrase structure trees, which leads to different numbers of shift-reduce actions between different outputs for the same input. This turns out to have a large empirical impact on the framework of global training and beam search. We propose a simple yet effective extension to the shift-reduce process, which eliminates size differences between action sequences in beam-search. Our parser gives comparable accuracies to the state-of-the-art chart parsers. With linear run-time complexity, our parser is over an order of magnitude faster than the fastest chart parser."

In particular, one can do this in linear time, and there is a net made up of about 1,000 processors which computes a universal partial-recursive function.

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling."

                "text": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a \u201cbetter\u201d basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."
