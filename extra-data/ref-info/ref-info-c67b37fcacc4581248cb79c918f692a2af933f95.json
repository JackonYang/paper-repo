The method uses flexible models derived from sets of training examples. These models, known as Point Distribution Models, represent objects as sets of labelled points. An initial estimate of the location of the model points in an image is improved by attempting to move each point to a better position nearby. Adjustments to the pose variables and shape parameters are calculated. Limits are placed on the shape parameters ensuring that the example can only deform into shapes conforming to global constraints imposed by the training set. An iterative procedure deforms the model example to find the best fit to the image object. Results of applying the method are described. The technique is shown to be a powerful method for refining estimates of object shape and location."

                "text": "This paper presents a stereo matching algorithm using the dynamic programming technique. The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

A smoothing term is added to the nonlinear functional to penalize discontinuous and irregular solutions. One option for the smoothing term is a quadratic form generated by a linear differential operator. The functional is then minimized using the Fourier representation of the planar mapping. With this representation the quadratic form is diagonalized. Another option is a quadratic form generated via a basis of compactly supported wavelets. In both cases, a natural approximation scheme is described. Both quadratic forms are shown to impose the same smoothing. However, in terms of the finite dimensional approximations, it is easier to accommodate local deformations using the wavelet basis."

The set of all possible true images is assumed to be formed by a composition of that function with continuous mappings of the domain into itself. A prior Gaussian distribution is given on the set of continuous mappings. The observed image is assumed to be a degradation of the true image with additive noise. Given the observed image, a posterior distribution is then obtained and has the form of a nonlinear perturbation of the Gaussian measure on the space of mappings. We present simulations of the posterior distribution that lead to structural reconstructions of the true image in the sense that it enables us to determine landmarks and other characteristic features of the image, as well as to spot pathologies in it. Moreover, we show that the reconstruction algorithm is relatively robust when the images are degraded by noise that is not necessarily additive."

Gibbs distributions are used. Then, given an image, roads are found by MAP (maximum aposteriori probability) estimation. The MAP estimation is handled by partitioning an image into windows, realizing the estimation in each window through the use of dynamic programming, and then, starting with the windows containing high confidence estimates, using dynamic programming again to obtain optimal global estimates of the roads present. The approach is model-based from the outset. It produces two boundaries for each road, or four boundaries when a midroad barrier is present.<<ETX>>"

Perhaps one picture represents a statistical norm for an organ, the other the form observed in an individual patient; or perhaps one represents an organ prior to a treatment, the other the same after treatment or after growth. I and my colleagues have argued elsewhere (Bookstein, 1986a, 1986b; Bookstein et al., 1985) that the crux of the quantitative analysis of biological form is the, representation of its variation by means of such mappings: this is the mathematical model of shape change as deformation. The idea is not new\u2014it is most often associated with the name of the great British natural philosopher D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2014but it is not familiar in the context of \u201cfeature extraction\u201d as currently applied in medical imaging. It is usual instead for features to pertain to images considered one at a time. In this paper I continue the elaboration of quantitative features for a pair of images viewed as corresponding biological scenes."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture inducstries. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquers this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on Ricci flow and nonlinear heat diffusion methods. The approach is general and robust. We employ our algorithm to study the constrained surface registration problem which applies to both computer vision and medical imaging applications. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic and achieve relatively high performance when evaluated with some popular surface registration evaluation standards."

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles.

The ideal textbook is constructed on a fixed coordinate system to contain all of the information currently available about the physical properties of neuroanatomies. This information is obtained via sensor probes such as magnetic resonance, as well as computed axial and emission tomography, along with symbolic information such as white- and gray-matter tracts, nuclei, etc. Human variability associated with individuals is accommodated by defining probabilistic transformations on the textbook coordinate system, the transformations forming mathematical translation groups of high dimension. The ideal is applied to the individual patient by finding the transformation which is consistent with physical properties of deformable elastic solids and which brings the coordinate system of the textbook to that of the patient. Registration, segmentation, and fusion all result automatically because the textbook carries symbolic values as well as multisensor features."

Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems."

One algorithm, based on breadth-first search, finds a perfect elimination ordering, if any exists, in $O(n + e)$ time, if the problem graph has n vertices and e edges. An extension of this algorithm finds a minimal (but not necessarily minimum) ordering in $O(ne)$ time. We conjecture that the problem of finding a minimum ordering is NP-complete"

Further all these models can be given an interpretation in terms of conditional independence and the interpretation can be read directly off the graph in the form of a Markov property.
