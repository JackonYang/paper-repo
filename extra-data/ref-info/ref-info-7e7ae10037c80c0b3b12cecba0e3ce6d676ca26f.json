Visual clues that exist in the image are used for extracting first the physical, and then the logical structure of the table. Since these visual clues generally have a logical meaning, there must be some association made between the graphical attributes extracted and their function of reflecting the logic expressed by the table; this knowledge is coordinated in a model. This approach, therefore, can be adapted to all tables which have graphical attributes discernible to the image analysis being used."

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."

In order to prove the feasibility of our concepts, we have developed the prototypical analysis system OfficeMAID (Office Mail Analysis, Interpretation and Delivery). The system analyses documents, as used in the daily work of a purchasing department, by a priori knowledge about workflows and document features. In this way, the system provides goal-directed information extraction, shallow understanding and process identification for given documents (paper, fax, e-mail)."
