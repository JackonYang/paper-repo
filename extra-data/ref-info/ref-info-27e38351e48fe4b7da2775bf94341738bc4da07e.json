To address this, we introduce a recursive neural network architecture for jointly parsing natural language and learning vector space representations for variable-sized inputs. At the core of our architecture are context-sensitive recursive neural networks (CRNN). These networks can induce distributed feature representations for unseen phrases and provide syntactic information to accurately predict phrase structure trees. Most excitingly, the representation of each phrase also captures semantic information: For instance, the phrases \u201cdecline to comment\u201d and \u201cwould not disclose the terms\u201d are close by in the induced embedding space. Our current system achieves an unlabeled bracketing F-measure of 92.1% on the Wall Street Journal dataset for sentences up to length 15."

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases."

As an alternative to this \u201cone task, one model\u201d approach, the Distributional Memory framework extracts distributional information once and for all from the corpus, in the form of a set of weighted word-link-word tuples arranged into a third-order tensor. Different matrices are then generated from the tensor, and their rows and columns constitute natural spaces to deal with different semantic problems. In this way, the same distributional information can be shared across tasks such as modeling word similarity judgments, discovering synonyms, concept categorization, predicting selectional preferences of verbs, solving analogy problems, classifying relations between word pairs, harvesting qualia structures with patterns or example pairs, predicting the typical properties of concepts, and classifying verbs into alternation classes. Extensive empirical testing in all these domains shows that a Distributional Memory implementation performs competitively against task-specific algorithms recently reported in the literature for the same tasks, and against our implementations of several state-of-the-art methods. The Distributional Memory approach is thus shown to be tenable despite the constraints imposed by its multi-purpose nature."

The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task."

Thus, we can model the compositional effects required for accurate assignment of phrase-level sentiment. For example, combining an adverb (e.g., \"very\") with a positive polar adjective (e.g., \"good\") produces a phrase (\"very good\") with increased polarity over the adjective alone. Inspired by recent work on distributional approaches to compositionality, we model each word as a matrix and combine words using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for the modeling of both additive and multiplicative semantic effects. Although the multiplication-based matrix-space framework has been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to model composition (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010), training such models has to be done carefully: the optimization is non-convex and requires a good initial starting point. This paper presents the first such algorithm for learning a matrix-space model for semantic composition. In the context of the phrase-level sentiment analysis task, our experimental results show statistically significant improvements in performance over a bag-of-words model."

Our model significantly outperforms the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task."

The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model."

This retrieval is facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure."

Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model's ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines."

In order to obtain high accuracy on this task, thorough syntactic and semantic analysis of the two statements is needed. We introduce a method for paraphrase detection based on recursive autoencoders (RAE). Our unsupervised RAEs are based on a novel unfolding objective and learn feature vectors for phrases in syntactic trees. These features are used to measure the word- and phrase-wise similarity between two sentences. Since sentences may be of arbitrary length, the resulting matrix of similarity measures is of variable size. We introduce a novel dynamic pooling layer which computes a fixed-sized representation from the variable-sized matrices. The pooled representation is then used as input to a classifier. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging MSRP paraphrase corpus."

                "text": "Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incorporated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval,"

By comparison, the area of semantic compositionality in these models has so far remained underdeveloped. This will be a crucial hurdle for semantic vector models: in order to play a fuller part in the modelling of human language, these models will need some way of modelling the way in which single concepts are put together to form more complex conceptual structures. This paper explores some of the opportunities for using vector product operations to model compositional phenomena in natural language. These vector operations are all well-known and used in mathematics and physics, particularly in quantum mechanics. Instead of designing new vector composition operators, this paper gathers a list of existing operators, and a list of typical composition operations in natural language, and describes two small experiments that begin to investigate the use of certain vector operators to model certain"

The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance."

Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%."

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field."

Subjective sentences often contain words which reverse the sentiment polarities of other words. Therefore, interactions between words need to be considered in sentiment classification, which is difficult to be handled with simple bag-of-words approaches, and the syntactic dependency structures of subjective sentences are exploited in our method. In the method, the sentiment polarity of each dependency subtree in a sentence, which is not observable in training data, is represented by a hidden variable. The polarity of the whole sentence is calculated in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. Sum-product belief propagation is used for inference. Experimental results of sentiment classification for Japanese and English subjective sentences showed that the method performs better than other methods based on bag-of-features."

Principal component analysis of the hidden unit activation patterns reveals that the network solves the task by developing complex distributed representations which encode the relevant grammatical relations and hierarchical constituent structure. Differences between the SRN state representations and the more traditional pushdown store are discussed in the final section."

Yet, compositional distributional models depend on a large set of parameters that have not been explored. In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimate parameters for a class of compositional distributional models: the additive models. Our approach leverages on two main ideas. Firstly, a novel idea for extracting compositional distributional semantics examples. Secondly, an estimation method based on regression models for multiple dependent variables. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods for determining a good model for compositional distributional semantics."

The task consists of annotating text with the tagset defined by the 41 Wordnet supersense classes for nouns and verbs. Since the tagset is directly related to Wordnet synsets, the tagger returns partial word sense disambiguation. Furthermore, since the noun tags include the standard named entity detection classes -- person, location, organization, time, etc. -- the tagger, as a by-product, returns extended named entity information. We cast the problem of supersense tagging as a sequential labeling task and investigate it empirically with a discriminatively-trained Hidden Markov Model. Experimental evaluation on the main sense-annotated datasets available, i.e., Semcor and Senseval, shows considerable improvements over the best known \"first-sense\" baseline."

Senses are interpreted as groups (or clusters) of similar contexts of the ambiguous word. Words, contexts, and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources. The paper demonstrates good performance of context-group discrimination for a sample of natural and artificial ambiguous words."

We present a connectionist architecture together with a novel supervised learning scheme which is capable of solving inductive inference tasks on complex symbolic structures of arbitrary size. The most general structures that can be handled are labeled directed acyclic graphs. The major difference of our approach compared to others is that the structure-representations are exclusively tuned for the intended inference task. Our method is applied to tasks consisting in the classification of logical terms. These range from the detection of a certain subterm to the satisfaction of a specific unification pattern. Compared to previously known approaches we obtained superior results in that domain."

This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, \"three stars\" is intuitively closer to \"four stars\" than to \"one star\".We first evaluate human performance at the task. Then, we apply a meta-algorithm, based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given n-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels. We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem."

This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labelled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated \u201call-purpose\u201d inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up."

The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call \"global\" approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat."

This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize."

This paper describes a method for representing more complex compositional structure in distributed representations. The method uses circular convolution to associate items, which are represented by vectors. Arbitrary variable bindings, short sequences of various lengths, simple frame-like structures, and reduced representations can be represented in a fixed width vector. These representations are items in their own right and can be used in constructing compositional structures. The noisy reconstructions extracted from convolution memories can be cleaned up by using a separate associative memory that has good reconstructive properties."

Our technique uses modifications based on typical substitutions web searchers make to their queries. In this way the new query is strongly related to the original query, containing terms closely related to all of the original terms. This contrasts with query expansion through pseudo-relevance feedback, which is costly and can lead to query drift. This also contrasts with query relaxation through boolean or TFIDF retrieval, which reduces the specificity of the query. We define a scale for evaluating query substitution, and show that our method performs well at generating new queries related to the original queries. We build a model for selecting between candidates, by using a number of features relating the query-candidate pair, and by fitting the model to human judgments of relevance of query suggestions. This further improves the quality of the candidates generated. Experiments show that our techniques significantly increase coverage and effectiveness in the setting of sponsored search."

Items, represented as sets of features, are associated by the operation of convolution. The associations are stored by being superimposed in a composite memory trace. Retrieval occurs when a cue item is correlated with the composite trace. The retrieved items are intrinsically noisy, may be ambiguous, and may under certain conditions be systematically distorted from their encoded form. A discrete response is selected by matching the retrieved item to all of the items in semantic memory. The model yields several new predictions about errors in single-trial cued recall that depend on similarity relations among the to-be-remembered items, and also about the efficacy of extralist cues. Experiments are presented that test these predictions against human recall. The model is then applied to several well-known results: prototype abstraction, the A-B A-D paradigm\u2014including the independence of the B and D responses\u2014 and the Osgood transfer surface."

Die Grunde, die dafur zu sprechen scheinen, sind folgende: a=a und a=b sind offenbar Satze von verschiedenem Erkenntniswerte: a=a gilt a priori und ist nach Kant analytisch zu nennen, wahrend Satze von der Form a=b oft sehr wertvolle Erweiterungen unserer Erkenntnis enthalten und a priori nicht immer zu begrunden sind. Die Entdeckung, das nicht jeden Morgen eine neue Sonne aufgeht, sondern immer dieselbe, ist wohl eine der folgenreichsten in der Astronomie gewesen. Noch jetzt ist die Wiedererkennung eines kleinen Planeten oder eines Kometen\nnicht immer etwas Selbstverstandliches."
