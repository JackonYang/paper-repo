Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

We begin, as we do in our previous algorithm, finding and validating each detected table candidates. We proceed to compute a set of probability measurements for each of the table entities. The computation of the probability measurements takes into consideration tables, table text separators and table neighboring text blocks. Then, an iterative updating method is used to optimize the page segmentation probability to obtain the final result. This new algorithm shows a great improvement over our previous algorithm. The training and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10, 934 cell entities. Compared with our previous work, it raised the accuracy rate to 95.67% from 90.32% and to 97.05% from 92.04%."

We put forward a flexible representation scheme for complex tables, based on a clear distinction between the physical layout of a table and its logical structure. Relying on this scheme, we develop a new method for the detection and the extraction of tables by an analysis of the graphic lines. To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited."

                "text": "This paper presents an improved zone content classification method. Motivated by our novel background-analysis-based table identification research, we added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published method [7]. The new features are the total area of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the zone. A binary decision tree is used to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. The training and testing data sets for the algorithm include images drawn from the UWCDROM-III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, text classes (of font size pt and font size pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. The improved zone classification method raised the accuracy rate to from and reduced the median false alarm rate to from . 1 Problem Statement Let ! be a set of zone entities. Let \" be a set of content labels, such as text, table, math, etc. The function #%$&!(')\" associates each element of * with a label. The function +,$-!.'0/ specifies measurements made on each element of ! , where / is the measurement space. The zone content classification problem can be formulated as follows: Given a zone set ! and a content label set \" , find a classification function #1$2!3'4\" , that has the maximum probability: 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8 (1) In our current approach, we assume conditional independence between the zone classifications, so the probability in Equation 1 may be decomposed as 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8= @ A B 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 (2) The problem can be solved by maximizing each individual probability 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 in Equation 2, where CFE ! . In our zone content classification experiment, the elements in set ! are zone groundtruth entities from UWCDROM III document image database [6]. The elements of set \" are text with font size GIH J pt, text with font size KLH M pt, math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. + 6DC 8 is a feature vector generated for C , where CNE ! . We used a decision tree classifier to compute the probability in Equation 2 and make the assignment. 2 Related Work and Paper Organization A complete document image understanding system can transform paper documents into a hierarchical representation of their structure and content. The transformed document representation enables document interchange, editing, browsing, indexing, filing and retrieval. The zone classification technique plays the key role in the success of such a document understanding system. Not only is it useful for successive applications such as OCR, table understanding, etc, but it can be used to assist and validate document segmentation. In the literature, Sivaramakrishnan et. al [7] extracted features for each zone such as run length mean and variance, spatial mean and variance, fraction of the total number of black pixels in the zone, and the zone width ratio for each zone. They used the decision tree classifier to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. They did their experiments on MPO M document images from UWCDROM I image database. Liang et. al [5] developed a feature based zone classifier using only the knowledge of the widths and the heights of the connected components within a given zone. Le et. al [4] proposed an automated labeling of zones from scanned images with labels such as titles, authors, affiliations and abstracts. The labeling is based on features calculated from optical character recognition(OCR) output, neural network models, machine learning methods, and a set of rules that is derived from an analysis of the page layout for each journal and from generic typesetting knowledge for English text. We developed a novel background-analysis-based table identification technique. We repeated Sivaramakrishnan et. al\u2019s work [7] on a larger database with a goal to improve its performance on table zone classification. Although some background analysis techniques can be found in the literature([1],[2]), none of them, to our knowledge, has been used in the table identification problem. We added two new features: the total area of large horizontal and vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the given zone, to the original feature vector. We improved the accuracy rate and reduced the false alarm rates for most of the nine classes. The rest of this paper is divided into Q sections. section 3 gives the definitions of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks. The two new features are described in section 4. A brief introduction to the decision tree classifier is given in section 5. The experimental results are reported in section 6. Our conclusion and statement of future work are discussed in section 7."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."

MOst of the IDU experimental systems, however, lack the capability of full exploitation of recognition results. In this paper we present an integrated IDU system that processes documents all the way from recognition to full utilization using standard generalized markup language (SGML). The standardization and widespread use of SGML-based tools provides the means for filling the gap between document recognition and seamless document reuse. The conversion process involves OCR of a multipage document, document structure analysis, processing of tabular data and mathematical expressions, and generation of the final SGML description. Document structure analysis is reduce here to parsing OCR results and recreating document structure by performing fuzzy searches for standard phrases and format analysis. Tabular data processing utilizes OCR results with positional data, horizontal lines and heuristic rules to determine cell boundaries and contents. Recognition of mathematical expressions involves OCR on an extended symbol set, and equation structure recognition via transformations on a tree representation. The transformations are ordered and involve connecting of separated symbols, context-sensitive OCR correction, extraction of horizontally aligned subexpressions, subscript and superscript processing, and a general processing of symbols detected above or below the target symbol."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

Contemporary technology for the discovery of basic textual units is based on either spatial or other content insensitive methods. However, there are many cases where knowledge of both the language and layout is required in order to establish the boundaries of the basic textual blocks. This paper describes a number of these cases and proposes the application of a general method combining knowledge about language with knowledge about the spatial arrangement of text. We claim that the comprehensive understanding of layout can only be achieved through the exploitation of layout knowledge and language knowledge in an inter-dependent manner."
