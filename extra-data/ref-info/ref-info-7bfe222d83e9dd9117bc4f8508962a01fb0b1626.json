Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The method operates by extracting two-dimensional models of an object from a sequence of images. The basic idea underlying the technique is to decompose the image of a solid object moving in space into two components: a two-dimensional motion and a two-dimensional shape change. The motion component is factored out and the shape change is represented explicitly by a sequence of two-dimensional models, one corresponding to each image frame. The major assumption underlying the method is that the two-dimensional shape of an object will change slowly from one frame to the next. There is no assumption, however, that the two-dimensional image motion between successive frames will be small.<<ETX>>"

During the last 5-6 years active contour models have become popular for finding the contours of such objects. Connected to these models are iterative algorithms for finding the minimizing energy curves making the curves behave dynamically through the iterations. These approaches do however have several disadvantages. The numerical algorithms that are in use constrain the models that can be used. Furthermore, in many cases only local minima can be achieved. In this paper, the author discusses a method for curve detection based on a fully Bayesian approach. A model for image contours which allows the number of nodes on the contours to vary is introduced. Iterative algorithms based on stochastic sampling is constructed, which make it possible to simulate samples from the posterior distribution, making estimates and uncertainty measures of specific quantities available. Further, simulated annealing schemes making the curve move dynamically towards the global minimum energy configuration are presented. In theory, no restrictions on the models are made. In practice, however, computational aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing the models. Much more general models than the one used for active contours may however be applied. The approach is applied to ultrasound images of the left ventricle and to magnetic resonance images of the human brain, and show promising results. >"

By studying 3D shapes that reproduce the input photographs up to a special image transformation called a shuffle transformation, we prove that (1) these shapes can be organized hierarchically into nested supersets of the scene, and (2) they can be computed using a simple algorithm called Approximate Space Carving that is provably-correct for arbitrary discrete scenes (i.e., for unknown, arbitrarily-shaped Lambertian scenes that are defined by a finite set of voxels and are viewed from N arbitrarily-distributed viewpoints inside or around them). The approach is specifically designed to attack practical reconstruction problems, including (1) recovering shape from images with inaccurate calibration information, and (2) building coarse scene models from multiple views."

We show how to learn a function between paths in the two systems, resolving ambiguities by integrating information over the entire length of a sequence. The basis of this function is a configural and dynamical manifold that summarizes the target system's behaviour. This manifold can be modeled from data with a hidden Markov model having special topological properties that we obtain via entropy minimization. Inference is then a matter of solving for the geodesic on the manifold that best explains the evidence in the cue sequence. We give a closed-form maximum a posteriori solution for geodesics through the learned density space, thereby obtaining optimal paths over the dynamical manifold. These methods give a completely general way to perform inference over time-series; in vision they support analysis, recognition, classification and synthesis of behaviours in linear time. We demonstrate with a prototype that infers 3D from monocular monochromatic sequences (e.g., back-subtractions), without using any articulatory body model. The framework readily accommodates multiple cameras and other sources of evidence such as optical flow or feature tracking."

A deformable region model is presented: its optimisation is based on texture correlation and is constrained by the use of a motion model, such as rigid, affine or homographic. The use of texture information (versus edge information) noticeably improves the tracking performances of deformable models in the presence of texture. Then the region contour is refined using an edge based deformable model in order to better deal with specularities, non planar objects and occlusions. The method is illustrated and validated by experimental results on real images.<<ETX>>"

The resulting models perform clustering, dimensionality reduction and time-series analysis in a way that is invariant to transformations in the input. Using the EM algorithm, these transformation invariant models can be fit to static data and time series. We give results on filtering microscopy images, face and facial pose clustering, handwritten digit modeling and recognition, video clustering, object tracking, and removal of distractions from video sequences."

The Kass et al.\u2019s algorithm involves four steps: setting up a variational integral on the continuous plane, deriving a pair of Euler equations, discretizing them, and solving the discrete equations iteratively until convergence. This algorithm suffers from a number of problems. We discuss these problems and present an algoIithm for active contours based on dynamic programming. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multi-stage decision process and is solved by a \u201ctime-delayed\u201d discrete dynamic programming algorithm. This formulation leads to a stable behavior for the active contours over iterations, in addition to allowing for hard constraints to be enforced on the behavior of the solution. Results of the application of the proposed algorithm to real images is presented."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

From synthetic data, we model the relationship between image and scene patches, and between a scene patch and neighboring scene patches. Given a new image, we propagate likelihoods in a Markov network (ignoring the effect of loops) to infer the underlying scene. This yields an efficient method to form low-level scene interpretations. We demonstrate the technique for motion analysis and estimating high resolution images from low-resolution ones."

                "text": "The term \u201cPattern Theory\u201d was introduced by Ulf Grenander in the 70s as a name for a field of applied mathematics which gave a theoretical setting for a large number of related ideas, techniques and results from fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, image and acoustic signal processing, pattern recognition and its statistical side, neural nets and parts of artificial intelligence (see [Grenander 76\u201381]). When I first began to study computer vision about ten years ago, I read parts of this book but did not really understand his insight. However, as I worked in the field, every time I felt I saw what was going on in a broader perspective or saw some theme which seemed to pull together the field as a whole, it turned out that this theme was part of what Grenander called pattern theory. It seems to me now that this is the right framework for these areas, and, as these fields have been growing explosively, the time is ripe for making an attempt to reexamine recent progress and try to make the ideas behind this unification better known. This article presents pattern theory from my point of view, which may be somewhat narrower than Grenander\u2019s, updated with recent examples involving interesting new mathematics."

However, it remains difficult to design an algorithm that is both efficient and capable of generating high quality results. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for realistic texture synthesis. The algorithm is easy to use and requires only a sample texture as input. It generates textures with perceived quality equal to or better than those produced by previous techniques, but runs two orders of magnitude faster. This permits us to apply texture synthesis to problems where it has traditionally been considered impractical. In particular, we have applied it to constrained synthesis for image editing and temporal texture generation. Our algorithm is derived from Markov Random Field texture models and generates textures through a deterministic searching process. We accelerate this synthesis process using tree-structured vector quantization."

A Markov random field model is assumed, and the conditional distribution of a pixel given all its neighbors synthesized so far is estimated by querying the sample image and finding all similar neighborhoods. The degree of randomness is controlled by a single perceptually intuitive parameter. The method aims at preserving as much local structure as possible and produces good results for a wide variety of synthetic and real-world textures."
