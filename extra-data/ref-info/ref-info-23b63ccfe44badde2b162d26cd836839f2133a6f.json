A successful page segmentation is a necessary precondition for a document recognition process to be successful. The problems addressed here are: design methods to describe all possible correct segmentations for a given page and design methods to compare two segmentations. The proposed segmentation ground truth representation scheme defines ground truth text regions as non-mergeable maximal sets of text lines, merged in a language- dependent direction. It includes the other possible correct segmentations in that authorized cuts in the region are explicitly specified. At this low-level stage, quality criteria for a page segmentation are mainly defined as providing correct input for region ordering and classification. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation method tests the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as being the black pixels contained in the derived polygons."
