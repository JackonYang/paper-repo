This is extremely challenging because of variation in pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

These variations arise from different clothing, anatomy, imaging conditions and the large number of poses it is possible for a human body to take. Recent work has shown state-of-the-art results by partitioning the pose space and using strong nonlinear classifiers such that the pose dependence and multi-modal nature of body part appearance can be captured. We propose to extend these methods to handle much larger quantities of training data, an order of magnitude larger than current datasets, and show how to utilize Amazon Mechanical Turk and a latent annotation update scheme to achieve high quality annotations at low cost. We demonstrate a significant increase in pose estimation accuracy, while simultaneously reducing computational expense by a factor of 10, and contribute a dataset of 10,000 highly articulated poses."

While large, manually collected datasets exist, the captured variations w.r.t. appearance, shape and pose are often uncontrolled thus limiting the overall performance. In order to overcome this limitation we propose a new technique to extend an existing training set that allows to explicitly control pose and shape variations. For this we build on recent advances in computer graphics to generate samples with realistic appearance and background while modifying body shape and pose. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of articulated human detection and articulated pose estimation. We report close to state of the art results on the popular Image Parsing [25] human pose estimation benchmark and demonstrate superior performance for articulated human detection. In addition we define a new challenge of combined articulated human detection and pose estimation in real-world scenes."

We exploit both appearance and motion information by defining suitable features of an image and its temporal neighbors, and learning a regression map to the parameters of a model of the human body using boosting techniques. Our algorithm can be viewed as a fast initialization step for human body trackers, or as a tracker itself. We extend gradient boosting techniques to learn a multi-dimensional map from (rotated and scaled) Haar features to the entire set of joint angles representing the full body pose. We test our approach by learning a map from image patches to body joint angles from synchronized video and motion capture walking data. We show how our technique enables learning an efficient real-time pose estimator, validated on publicly available datasets."

Pose estimation is formulated as a jigsaw puzzle problem in which the body part tiles maximally cover the foreground region, match local image features, and satisfy body plan and color constraints. This method explicitly imposes a global shape constraint on the body part assembly. It anchors multiple body parts simultaneously and introduces hyperedges in the part relation graph, which is essential for detecting complex poses. Using multiple cues in pose estimation, our method is resistant to cluttered foregrounds. We propose an efficient linear method to solve the consistent max-covering problem. A two-stage relaxation finds the solution in polynomial time. Our experiments on a variety of images and videos show that the proposed method is more robust than previous locally constrained methods."

While the fine-level state-space of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models, most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions, where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals. The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

Notably, we do not use articulated limb parts, but rather capture orientation with a mixture of templates for each part. We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

Pose accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the part detectors but more accurate detectors are likely to be also more computationally expensive. We propose to use multiple, heterogeneous part detectors with varying accuracy and computation requirements, ordered in a hierarchy, to achieve more accurate and efficient pose estimation. For inference, we propose an algorithm to localize articulated objects by exploiting an ordered hierarchy of detectors with increasing accuracy. The inference uses branch and bound method to search for each part and use kinematics from neighboring parts to guide the branching behavior and compute bounds on the best part estimate. We demonstrate our approach on a publicly available People dataset and outperform the state-of-art methods. Our inference is 3 times faster than one based on using a single, highly accurate detector."

In this work we attempt to tackle this problem in a general setting. The dataset we use is a collection of sports news photographs of baseball players, varying dramatically in pose and clothing. The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures. We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted full body configurations."

Unfortunately, articulated objects are also very difficult to detect. Knowledge about the articulated nature of these objects, however, can substantially contribute to the task of finding them in an image. It is somewhat surprising, that these two tasks are usually treated entirely separately. In this paper, we propose an Articulated Part-based Model (APM) for jointly detecting objects and estimating their poses. APM recursively represents an object as a collection of parts at multiple levels of detail, from coarse-to-fine, where parts at every level are connected to a coarser level through a parent-child relationship (Fig. 1(b)-Horizontal). Parts are further grouped into part-types (e.g., left-facing head, long stretching arm, etc) so as to model appearance variations (Fig. 1(b)-Vertical). By having the ability to share appearance models of part types and by decomposing complex poses into parent-child pairwise relationships, APM strikes a good balance between model complexity and model richness. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiment results on public datasets show that APM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show results on PASCAL 2007 - cats and dogs - two highly challenging articulated object categories."

In previous articulated pose estimation work on unconstrained videos, using temporal coupling of limb positions has made little to no difference in performance over parsing frames individually [8, 28]. One crucial reason for this is that joint parsing of multiple articulated parts over time involves intractable inference and learning problems, and previous work has resorted to approximate inference and simplified models. We overcome these computational and modeling limitations using an ensemble of tractable submodels which couple locations of body joints within and across frames using expressive cues. Each submodel is responsible for tracking a single joint through time (e.g., left elbow) and also models the spatial arrangement of all joints in a single frame. Because of the tree structure of each submodel, we can perform efficient exact inference and use rich temporal features that depend on image appearance, e.g., color tracking and optical flow contours. We propose and experimentally investigate a hierarchy of submodel combination methods, and we find that a highly efficient max-marginal combination method outperforms much slower (by orders of magnitude) approximate inference using dual decomposition. We apply our pose model on a new video dataset of highly varied and articulated poses from TV shows. We show significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art single-frame pose estimation approaches."

There are two kinds of edges defined in the body part relation graph: Strong (tree) edges corresponding to the body plan that can enforce any type of constraint, and weak (non-tree) edges that express exclusion constraints arising from inter-part occlusion and symmetry conditions. We express optimal part localization as a multiple shortest path problem in a set of correlated trellises constructed from the graph model. Strong model edges generate the trellises, while weak model edges prohibit implausible poses by generating exclusion constraints among trellis nodes and edges. The optimization may be expressed as an integer linear program and solved using a novel two-stage relaxation scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method has a high chance of obtaining the globally optimal pose at low computational cost."

To achieve tractability, the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example, by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions. These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data. On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars."

We extend previous N-best algorithms from the speech community to incorporate non-maximal suppression cues, such that pixel-shifted copies of a single configuration are not returned. We use approximate algorithms that perform nearly identical to their exact counterparts, but are orders of magnitude faster. Our approach outperforms standard methods for generating multiple object configurations in an image. We use our method to generate multiple pose hypotheses for the problem of human pose estimation from video sequences. We present quantitative results that demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm."

We show how this seemingly difficult problem can be solved by (i) reducing it to an equivalent convex problem with a small, polynomial number of constraints (taking advantage of the fact that the model is tree-structured and the potentials have a special form); and (ii) obtaining the globally optimal model using an efficient dual decomposition strategy. Each component of the dual decomposition is solved by a modified version of the highly optimized SVM-Light algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we learn human upper body models using two challenging, publicly available datasets. Our model accounts for the articulation of humans as well as the occlusion of parts. We compare our method with a baseline iterative strategy as well as a state of the art algorithm and show significant efficiency improvements."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The tracker recovers the affine transformation of the region and therefore yields reliable point correspondences between frames. Both edges and texture information are exploited in an integrated way, while not requiring the complete region's contour. The tracker withstands zoom, out-of-plane rotations, discontinuous motion and changes in illumination conditions while achieving real-time performance for a region. Multiple tracked regions are grouped into disjoint coplanarity classes. We first define a coplanarity score between each pair of regions, based on motion and texture cues. The scores are then analyzed by a clique-partitioning algorithm yielding the coplanarity classes that best fit the data. The method works in the presence of perspective distortions, discontinuous planar surfaces and considerable amounts of measurement noise."

We capture the geometric deformations of the 2D human figure using an extension of the Common Factor Model (CFM) of Lan and Huttenlocher. The key contribution of the paper is an improved iterative message passing inference algorithm that runs faster than the original CFM algorithm. This is based on the insight that messages created using the distance transform are shift invariant and therefore messages can be created once and then shifted for subsequent iterations. Since shifting (O(1) complexity) is faster than computing a distance transform (O(n) complexity), a significant speedup is observed in the experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model for the human parsing problem using the Iterative Parsing data set and results are competitive with the state of the art detection algorithm of Andriluka, et al."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."
