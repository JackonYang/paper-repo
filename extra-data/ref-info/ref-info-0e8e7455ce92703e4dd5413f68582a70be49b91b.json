Experimental cluster analysis is performed on a sample corpus of 2267 documents. A term-term similarity matrix is constructed for the 3950 unique terms used to index the documents. Various threshold values, T, are applied to the similarity matrix to provide a series of binary threshold matrices. The corresponding graph of each binary threshold matrix is used to obtain the term clusters.\nThree definitions of a cluster are analyzed: (1) the connected components of the threshold matrix; (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the connected components of the threshold matrix; (3) clusters of the maximal complete subgraphs of the threshold matrix, as described by Gotlieb and Kumar.\nAlgorithms are described and analyzed for obtaining each cluster type. The algorithms are designed to be useful for large document and index collections. Two algorithms have been tested that find maximal complete subgraphs. An algorithm developed by Bierstone offers a significant time improvement over one suggested by Bonner.\nFor threshold levels T \u2265 0.6, basically the same clusters are developed regardless of the cluster definition used. In such situations one need only find the connected components of the graph to develop the clusters."

Programmed for the GE-225, accurate answers of tan-1 1 = ~-/4 were obtained for double precision in comparison with the known values. The semiiterative method can be programmed in a very short time for any multiple precision and is efficient in comparison with taking more terms of the Taylor's series, taking into account the divisions required for the square root process. Telescoped Taylor's series may be used if desired, but a shorter telescoped Taylor's series can be used if the semi-iterative scheme is employed. Telescoping, however, is expected to take more storage for the coefficients than a simple truncated series. Telescoping also discards the advantage of flexibility and applicability to n-tuple precision programs. A contribution to this department must be in the form of an Algorithm, a Certification, or a Remark. Contributions should be sent in duplicate to the Editor and should be written in a style patterned after recent contributions appearing in this department.

For the convenience of the printer, contributors are requested to double space material and underline delimiters and logical values that arc to appear in boldface type. Whenever feasible, Certifications should include numerical values. Although each algorithm has been tested by its contributor , no warranty, express or implied, is made by the contributor , the Editor, or the Association for Computing Machinery as to the accuracy and functioning of the algorithm and related algorithm material, and no responsibility is assumed by the contributor, the Editor, or the Association for Computing Machinery in connection there-with.

When reproduction is for publication purposes, reference must be made to the algorithm author and to the Communications issue bearing the algorithm. comment If the array S contains a certain permutation of the N digits 1, 2,... , N before call, the procedure will replace this with the lexicographically next permutation.
