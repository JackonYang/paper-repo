The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves."

This paper provides an axiomatic basis, called a semigraphoid, which captures the structure common to all four types of dependencies and explores the expressive power of DAGs in representing various types of data dependencies. It is shown that DAGs can represent a richer set of dependencies than undirected graphs, that DAGs completely represent the closure of their specification bases, and that they offer an effective computational device for testing membership in that closure as well as inferring new dependencies from given inputs. These properties might explain the prevailing use of DAGs in causal reasoning and semantic nets."

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

A subnetwork is \u201csolved\u201d by computing the probability for classes of failure patterns within which the network performance is constant. We then iterate, combining solved subnetworks until the entire network has been evaluated. The running time for each iteration depends superexponentially on the subnetwork boundary size, but for treelike or \u201cthin\u201d networks total time grows only linearly with total network size. Details of our decomposition scheme are presented for a wide variety of measures of performance. For measures where computing the distribution of performance is too slow we present a quicker method which finds the average performance. Finally, we show that computing network reliability is NP-hard, so that efficiency in special cases is all that can be achieved."

The network has built-in mechanisms that will detect when the network is confronted with a situation outside the limits of its own knowledge and it handles conflicting evidence in a simple and consistent way."

A reasonable explicatum will also be suggested for the degree to which one event caused another one. It may be possible to find other reasonable explicata for tendency to cause, but, if so, the assumptions made here will have to be changed. I believe that the first clear-cut application in science will be to the foundations of statistics, such as to an improved understanding of the function of randormsation, but I am content for the present to regard the work as contributing to the philosophy of science, and especially to what may be called the ' mathematics of philosophy '. Light may also be shed on problems of allocating blame and credit. I hope to consider applications to statistics on another occasion.2 In a previous note 3 I have tried to give an interpretation of 'an event F caused another event E ' without making reference to time. It was presumably clear from the last three paragraphs, which were added in"

The domain of hypercalcemic disorders is used to test solution methods that should be applicable to other medical areas. A key design philosophy underlying NESTOR is that the physicians should have control of the computer interaction to determine what is done and when. In order to provide such controllable, interactive aid, specific technical tasks to be addressed. The unifying philosophy in addressing them is the use of knowledge-based methods within a formal probability theory framework. A user interface module gives the physician control over when and how these tasks are used to aid in diagnosing the cause of a patient's condition. This dissertation presents the problems that are addressed by each of the three tasks, and the details of the methods used to address them. In addition, the results of an evaluation of the hypothesis scoring and search techniques are presented and discussed. Additional keywords: artificial intelligence; expert systems; medical applications; computer aided diagnosis; medical computer applications."

Most current inference systems in artificial intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts. We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements."
