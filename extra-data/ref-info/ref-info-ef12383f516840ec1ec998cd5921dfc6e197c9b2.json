Paraphrase acquisition methods that use a single monolingual corpus often produce only syntactic paraphrases. We present a method for obtaining surface paraphrases, using a 150GB (25 billion words) monolingual corpus. Our method achieves an accuracy of around 70% on the paraphrase acquisition task. We further show that we can use these paraphrases to generate surface patterns for relation extraction. Our patterns are much more precise than those obtained by using a state of the art baseline and can extract relations with more than 80% precision for each of the test relations."

Two techniques are employed: (1) simple string edit distance, and (2) a heuristic strategy that pairs initial (presumably summary) sentences from different news stories in the same cluster. We evaluate both datasets using a word alignment algorithm and a metric borrowed from machine translation. Results show that edit distance data is cleaner and more easily-aligned than the heuristic data, with an overall alignment error rate (AER) of 11.58% on a similarly-extracted test set. On test data extracted by the heuristic strategy, however, performance of the two training sets is similar, with AERs of 13.2% and 14.7% respectively. Analysis of 100 pairs of sentences from each set reveals that the edit distance data lacks many of the complex lexical and syntactic alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase. The summary sentences, while less readily alignable, retain more of the non-trivial alternations that are of greatest interest learning paraphrase relationships."

However, it is not clear whether bitexts are an appropriate resource for extracting more sophisticated sentential paraphrases, which are more obviously learnable from monolingual parallel corpora. We extend bilingual paraphrase extraction to syntactic paraphrases and demonstrate its ability to learn a variety of general paraphrastic transformations, including passivization, dative shift, and topicalization. We discuss how our model can be adapted to many text generation tasks by augmenting its feature set, development data, and parameter estimation routine. We illustrate this adaptation by using our paraphrase model for the task of sentence compression and achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art compression systems."

We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account.

Experimental results show that the SMT-based paraphrasing model can be enhanced using multiple resources. The phrase-level and sentence-level precision of the generated paraphrases are above 60% and 55%, respectively. In addition, the contribution of each resource is evaluated, which indicates that all the exploited resources are useful for generating paraphrases of high quality."

Our primary goal is the labeling of syntactic nodes with specific argument labels that preserve the similarity of roles such as the window in John broke the window and the window broke. After motivating the need for explicit predicate argument structure labels, we briefly discuss the theoretical considerations of predicate argument structure and the need to maintain consistency across syntactic alternations. The issues of consistency of argument structure across both polysemous and synonymous verbs are also discussed and we present our actual guidelines for these types of phenomena, along with numerous examples of tagged sentences and verb frames. Metaframes are introduced as a technique for handling similar frames among near\u2212 synonymous verbs. We conclude with a summary of the current status of annotation process."

It is available in all 20 official EU languages, with additional documents being available in the languages of the EU candidate countries. The corpus consists of almost 8,000 documents per language, with an average size of nearly 9 million words per language. Pair-wise paragraph alignment information produced by two different aligners (Vanilla and HunAlign) is available for all 190+ language pair combinations. Most texts have been manually classified according to the EUROVOC subject domains so that the collection can also be used to train and test multi-label classification algorithms and keyword-assignment software. The corpus is encoded in XML, according to the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. Due to the large number of parallel texts in many languages, the JRC-Acquis is particularly suitable to carry out all types of cross-language research, as well as to test and benchmark text analysis software across different languages (for instance for alignment, sentence splitting and term extraction)."

Previous research has relied on search engines to collect online information, but this is hopelessly inefficient for building large-scale linguistic resources, such as lists of named-entity types or clusters of distributionally similar words. An alternative to processing web-scale text directly is to use the information provided in an N-gram corpus. An N-gram corpus is an efficient compression of large amounts of text. An N-gram corpus states how often each sequence of words (up to length N) occurs. We propose tools for working with enhanced web-scale N-gram corpora that include richer levels of source annotation, such as part-of-speech tags. We describe a new set of search tools that make use of these tags, and collectively lower the barrier for lexical learning and ambiguity resolution at web-scale. They will allow novel sources of information to be applied to long-standing natural language challenges."

We present a new corpus that is suited to our task and a discriminative tree-to-tree transduction model that can naturally account for structural and lexical mismatches. The model incorporates a novel grammar extraction method, uses a language model for coherent output, and can be easily tuned to a wide range of compression specific loss functions."

We present a correlation study comparing TERp to BLEU, METEOR and TER, and illustrate that TERp can better evaluate translation adequacy."

We evaluate these global, context-aware query expansion techniques on tfidf retrieval from 10 million question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages. Experimental results show that SMTbased expansion improves retrieval performance over local expansion and over retrieval without expansion."

Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns. By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word's coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa. We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy (WordNet 2.1). We add 10,000 novel synsets to WordNet 2.1 at 84% precision, a relative error reduction of 70% over a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers. Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23% relative F-score improvement over WordNet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

It is a theoretically oriented treatment of a practical subject. Our motivation for making it so is threefold. \n \n(1) In an area as rapidly changing as Computer Science, sound pedagogy demands that courses emphasize ideas, rather than implementation details. It is our hope that the algorithms and concepts presented in this book will survive the next generation of computers and programming languages, and that at least some of them will be applicable to fields other than compiler writing. \n \n(2) Compiler writing has progressed to the point where many portions of a compiler can be isolated and subjected to design optimization. It is important that appropriate mathematical tools be available to the person attempting this optimization. \n \n(3) Some of the most useful and most efficient compiler algorithms, e.g. LR(k) parsing, require a good deal of mathematical background for full understanding. We expect, therefore, that a good theoretical background will become essential for the compiler designer. \n \nWhile we have not omitted difficult theorems that are relevant to compiling, we have tried to make the book as readable as possible. Numerous examples are given, each based on a small grammar, rather than on the large grammars encountered in practice. It is hoped that these examples are sufficient to illustrate the basic ideas, even in cases where the theoretical developments are difficult to follow in isolation. \n \nFrom volume 2 Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nCompiler design is one of the first major areas of systems programming for which a strong theoretical foundation is becoming available. Volume I of The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling developed the relevant parts of mathematics and language theory for this foundation and developed the principal methods of fast syntactic analysis. Volume II is a continuation of Volume I, but except for Chapters 7 and 8 it is oriented towards the nonsyntactic aspects of compiler design. \n \nThe treatment of the material in Volume II is much the same as in Volume I, although proofs have become a little more sketchy. We have tried to make the discussion as readable as possible by providing numerous examples, each illustrating one or two concepts. \n \nSince the text emphasizes concepts rather than language or machine details, a programming laboratory should accompany a course based on this book, so that a student can develop some facility in applying the concepts discussed to practical problems. The programming exercises appearing at the ends of sections can be used as recommended projects in such a laboratory. Part of the laboratory course should discuss the code to be generated for such programming language constructs as recursion, parameter passing, subroutine linkages, array references, loops, and so forth."

In this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes transitivity constraints to learn a globally-optimal set of entailment rules for typed predicates. We model the task as a graph learning problem and suggest methods that scale the algorithm to larger graphs. We apply the algorithm over a large data set of extracted predicate instances, from which a resource of typed entailment rules has been recently released (Schoenmackers et al., 2010). Our results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance over this resource and several baselines, and that our scaling methods allow us to increase the scope of global learning of entailment-rule graphs."

However, only a limited number of tasks have so far been tested using Web-scale data sets. The present article overcomes this limitation by systematically investigating the performance of Web-based models for several NLP tasks, covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a wider range of n-grams and parts of speech than have been previously explored. For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus. In some cases, performance can be improved further by using backoff or interpolation techniques that combine Web counts and corpus counts. However, unsupervised Web-based models generally fail to outperform supervised state-of-the-art models trained on smaller corpora. We argue that Web-based models should therefore be used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative to, standard supervised models."
