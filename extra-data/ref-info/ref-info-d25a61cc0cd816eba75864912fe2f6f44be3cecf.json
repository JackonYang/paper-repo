The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

In particular tables are powerful tools that allow large quantities of data to be easily understood. An automated document entry system is needed that can recognize the document layout objects and extract the information from tables. In this paper an effective table recognition method is described. The proposed method is composed of three steps: (1) document layout structure recognition (2) table layout structure recognition (3) table content recognition. To develop the table layout structure recognition step we first examined the layout structure of tables in existing documents and classified several common structures. As a result of the examination we created ten rules and designed a ruled line and box extraction algorithm based on these rules. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed in experiments. Accordingly the proposed method will greatly contribute to the creation of an automated document entry system to allow faster document recognition and permit the data in tables to be extracted."

Following the initial binarization and deskewing operations, the image is scanned to extract all horizontal and vertical lines that are present. The table's dimensions are estimated based on these lines. Unlike other systems, the procedure described does not depend on the sole existence of lines to mark the item blocks. White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines. A structure interpretation procedure uses the extracted demarcation information to identify each of the item blocks in the table. Subsequently, the interrelations of these item blocks are used to recognize the structure of the tabulated data.<<ETX>>"
