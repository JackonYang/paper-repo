This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition."

                "text": "Abstract : Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams (Rumelhart 86) describe a learning procedure for layered networks of deterministic, neuron-like units. This paper describes further research on the learning procedure. We start by describing the units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative nets. We then give an example in which a network learns a set of filters that enable it to discriminate formant-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in weight space . We give examples of the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. We give some preliminary results on scaling and show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. Additional results illustrate the effects on learning speed of the amount of interaction between the weights. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our iterative networks and the analog networks described by Hopefield and Tank (Hopfield 85). The learning procedure can discover appropriate weights in their kind of network, as well as determine an optimal schedule for varying the nonlinearity of the units during a search."
