We present simulations that show the effect of initial conditions, training set size and order, and neural network architecture. All simulations were performed with random initial weight strengths and usually converge after approximately a hundred epochs of training. We discuss a quantization algorithm for dynamically extracting finite state automata during and after training. For a well-trained neural net, the extracted automata constitute an equivalence class of state machines that are reducible to the minimal machine of the inferred grammar. We then show through simulations that many of the neural net state machines are dynamically stable, that is, they correctly classify many long unseen strings. In addition, some of these extracted automata actually outperform the trained neural network for classification of unseen strings."

We show that similar methods are appropriate for learning unknown grammars from examples of their strings. The training algorithm is an incremental real-time, recurrent learning (RTRL) method that computes the complete gradient and updates the weights at the end of each string. After or during training, a dynamic clustering algorithm extracts the production rules that the neural network has learned. The methods are illustrated by extracting rules from unknown deterministic regular grammars. For many cases the extracted grammar outperforms the neural net from which it was extracted in correctly classifying unseen strings."

The robot's task is to construct an internal model of its environment, a model that will allow it to predict the effects of its actions and to determine what sequences of actions to take to reach particular goal states. Rivest and Schapire (1987a,b; Schapire 1988) have studied this problem and have designed a symbolic algorithm to strategically explore and infer the structure of finite state environments. The heart of this algorithm is a clever representation of the environment called an update graph. We have developed a connectionist implementation of the update graph using a highly specialized network architecture. With backpropagation learning and a trivial exploration strategy choosing random actions the connectionist network can outperform the Rivest and Schapire algorithm on simple problems. Our approach has additional virtues, including the fact that the network can accommodate stochastic environments and that it suggests generalizations of the update graph representation that do not arise from a traditional, symbolic perspective."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."
