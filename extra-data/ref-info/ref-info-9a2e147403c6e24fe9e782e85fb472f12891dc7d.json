Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our findings."

POD is to detect page objects (tables, mathematical equations, graphics, figures, etc.) from document images. This competition makes use of a dataset consists of 2,000 document page images This dataset contains abundant page objects with various types and layouts. During the competition, we received 13 different teams' registrations and finally 8 of them submitted their results. All teams used deep learning as the basic method, then combined different traditional features or methods to improve the detection performance. The team NLPR-PAL achieved the averaged F1 of 0.898 and mAPs of 0.805 in the detection of all page objects under the IOU threshold 0.8. In this overview paper, we summarize the task design, dataset, results, and the approaches used by those teams of this competitions."
