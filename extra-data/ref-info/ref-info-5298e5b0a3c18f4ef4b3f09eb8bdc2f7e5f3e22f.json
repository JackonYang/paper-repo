The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

For example, most optical character recognition [OCR] machines are limited to a few fonts of machine print, or text that is handprinted under certain constraints; any deviation from these constraints will produce highly garbled text. This paper describes an algorithm for text recognition/correction that effectively merges a bottom-up refinement process that is based on the utilization of transitional probabilities and letter confusion probabilities, known as the Viterbi algorithm [VA], together with a top-down process based on searching a trie structure representation of a lexicon. The algorithm is applicable to text containing an arbitrary number of character substitution errors such as that produced by OCR machines."

The algorithm assumes language to be a Markov chain and uses transition probabilities between characters.

Four algorithms were developed using a technique called vector processing (representing alphabetic words as numeric vectors) and also by applying Bayes maximum likelihoods olutions to correct the OCR output. The result was the development of a software simulator which processed sequential fields generated by the Advanced Optical Character Reader (in use by the U.S. Postal Service in New York City), performed the four functions indicated above, and selected the correct alphabetic word from a dictionary of 62000 entries."
