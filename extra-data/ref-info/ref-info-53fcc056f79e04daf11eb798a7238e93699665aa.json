Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

Such methods are important and have demonstrated effectiveness for problems with large or huge matrices which do not enjoy any detectable or usable structural pattern, apart from a high degree of sparaseness.Fields of application where row-action methods are used in various ways include image reconstruction from projection, operations research and game theory, learning theory, pattern recognition and transportation theory.

Based on this, a new algorithm for solving interval convex programming problems, i.e., problems of the form minf(x), subject to \u03b3\u2264Ax\u2264\u03b4, is proposed. For a certain family of functionsf(x), which includes the norm \u2225x\u2225 and thex logx entropy function, convergence is proved.

This network forms compact representations, yet learns easily and rapidly. The network can be used at any time in the learning process and the learning patterns do not have to be repeated. The units in this network respond to only a local region of the space of input values. The network learns by allocating new units and adjusting the parameters of existing units. If the network performs poorly on a presented pattern, then a new unit is allocated that corrects the response to the presented pattern. If the network performs well on a presented pattern, then the network parameters are updated using standard LMS gradient descent. We have obtained good results with our resource-allocating network (RAN). For predicting the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, RAN learns much faster than do those using backpropagation networks and uses a comparable number of synapses."

People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection."
