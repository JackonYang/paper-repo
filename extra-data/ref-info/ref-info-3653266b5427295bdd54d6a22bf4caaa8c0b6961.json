We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

Both form a set of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances. This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets considered."

To study this, the concepts of bias and variance of a classifier are defined. Unstable classifiers can have universally low bias. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions is a variance reducing device. One of the most effective is bagging (Breiman [1996a]) Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire [1995,1996] propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym-arcing) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often missclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more sucessful than bagging in variance reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works."

Previous work has shown that an effective ensemble should consist of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well. Most existing techniques, however, only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set of networks. In this paper we present a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. ADDEMUP works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that ADDEMUP is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches. Experiments also show that ADDEMUP is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble."

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well; however, most existing techniques only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set. We present an algorithm called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to search explicitly for a highly diverse set of accurate trained networks. ADDEMUP works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to create new networks continually, keeping the set of networks that are highly accurate while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on four real-world domains show that ADDEMUP is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing ensemble approaches. Experiments also show ADDEMUP is able to incorporate prior..."

Hansen and Salamon showed that, under certain assumptions, combining the predictions of several separately trained neural networks will improve generalization. One of their key assumptions is that the individual networks should be independent in the errors they produce. In the standard way of performing backpropagation this assumption may be violated, because the standard procedure is to initialize network weights in the region of weight space near the origin. This means that backpropagation's gradient-descent search may only reach a small subset of the possible local minima. In this paper we present an approach to initializing neural networks that uses competitive learning to intelligently create networks that are originally located far from the origin of weight space, thereby potentially increasing the set of reachable local minima. We report experiments on two real-world datasets where combinations of networks initialized with our method generalize better than combinations of networks initialized the traditional way."

In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning."

It is discussed how to use the ambiguity in combination with cross-validation to give a reliable estimate of the ensemble generalization error, and how this type of ensemble cross-validation can sometimes improve performance. It is shown how to estimate the optimal weights of the ensemble members using unlabeled data. By a generalization of query by committee, it is finally shown how the ambiguity can be used to select new training data to be labeled in an active learning scheme."

These networks will converge to different solutions due to using different models, different parameter set sizes or any other factor related to training. Two training methods are used, i.e., grow and learn (GAL), a memory based method, and backpropagation. Several voting schemes are investigated, and their performances are composed in the case of classification on a real world application (recognition of handwritten numerals) and a two-dimensional didactic case. The weights in voting may be interpreted in two ways: the certainty of a network in its output, and in a Bayesian setting, the plausibility, i.e., the prior probability of the model. In all cases tested, the result of voting is better than the results of all of the networks that participated in the voting process.<<ETX>>"

For learning in large ensembles, it is advantageous to use under-regularized students, which actually over-fit the training data. Globally optimal performance can be obtained by choosing the training set sizes of the students appropriately. For smaller ensembles, optimization of the ensemble weights can yield significant improvements in ensemble generalization performance, in particular if the individual students are subject to noise in the training process. Choosing students with a wide range of regularization parameters makes this improvement robust against changes in the unknown level of noise in the training data."

Solving exactly the simple model scenario of an ensemble of linear students, we nd surprisingly rich behaviour. For learning in large ensembles, it is advantageous to use under-regularized students , which actually overt the training data. Globally optimal generalization performance can be obtained by choosing the training set sizes of the students appropriately. For smaller ensembles, optimization of the ensemble weights can yield signiicant improvements in ensemble generalization performance, in particular if the individual students are subject to noise in the training process. Choosing students with a wide range of regularization parameters makes this improvement robust against changes in the unknown level of noise in the training data."
