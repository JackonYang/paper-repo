The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software-agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information.

In our experiments, ILA starts with knowledge of local faculty members, and is able to learn models of the Internet service whois and of the personnel directories available at Berkeley, Brown, Caltech, Cornell, Rice, Rutgers, and UCI, averaging fewer than 40 queries per information source. ILA\u2019s hypothesis language is first-order conjunctions, and its bias is compactly encoded as a determination.

In using these systems, users enter question in natural language and the system attempts answer that question, using FAQ files as a resource. We combined two technologies in developing these systems: statistically based IR engines and more semantically based \"language matchers\". The power of our approach rises out of two features: first, we are using knowledge sources that have already been designed to answer the commonly asked questions in a domain and are more highly organized than free text; second, these systems do not have to comprehend the queries they receive. They only have to identify the relevant files and then match against the segments of text that are used to organize the files themselves.<<ETX>>"

The softbot uses a UNIX shell and the World-Wide Web to interact with a wide range of internet resources. The softbot\u2019s effectors include ftp, telnet, mail, and numerous file manipulation commaslds. Its sensors include internet facilities such as archie, gopher, netfind, and many more. The softbot is designed to incorporate new facilities into its repertoirc as they become available. The softbot\u2019s \"added value\" is three-fold. First, it provides an integrated and expressive interface to the internet. Second, the softbot dynamically chooses which facilities to invoke, and in what sequence. For example, the softbot might use netfind to determine David McAllester\u2019s e-mail address. Since it knows that netfind requires a person\u2019s institution as input, the softbot would first search bibliographic databases for a technical report by McAllester which would reveal his institutkm, and then feed that information to netfind. Third, the softbot fluidly backtracks from one facility to another based on information collected at run time. As a result., the softbot\u2019s behavior changes in response to transient system conditions (e.g., the UUCP gateway is down). In this article, we focus on the ideas underlying the softbot-based interface."

Work in multidatabase systems has begun to address this problem, but it has primarily focused on methods for communicating between databases and requires significant effort for each new database added to the system. This paper describes a more general approach that exploits a semantic model of a problem domain to integrate the information from various information sources. The information sources handled include both databases and knowledge bases, and other information sources (e.g. programs) could potentially be incorporated into the system. This paper describes how both the domain and the information sources are modeled, shows how a query at the domain level is mapped into a set of queries to individual information sources, and presents algorithms for automatically improving the efficiency of queries using knowledge about both the domain and the information sources. This work is implemented in a system called SIMS and has been tested in a transportation planning domain using nine Oracle databases and a Loom knowledge base."

The paper discusses an interface agent which has been modelled closely after the metaphor of a personal assistant. The agent learns how to assist the user by (i) observing the user's actions and imitating them, (ii) receiving user feedback when it takes wrong actions and (iii) being trained by the user on the basis of hypothetical examples. The paper discusses how this learning agent was implemented using memory-based learning and reinforcement learning techniques. It presents actual results from two prototype agents built using these techniques: one for a meeting scheduling application and one for electronic mail. It argues that the machine learning approach to building interface agents is a feasible one which has several advantages over other approaches: it provides a customized and adaptive solution which is less costly and ensures better user acceptability. The paper also argues what the advantages are of the particular learning techniques used."

This is due, in part, to the high cost of developing and maintaining customized knowledge bases. The construction of personal assistants as learning apprentices -- interactive assistants that learn continually from their users -- is one approach which could dramatically reduce the cost of knowledge-based advisors. We present one such personal learning apprentice, called CAP, which assists in managing a meeting calendar. CAP has been used since June 1991 by a secretary in our work place to manage a faculty member's meeting calendar and is the first instance of a fielded learning apprentice in routine use. This paper describes the organization of CAP, its performance in initial field tests, and more general lessons learned from this effort about learning apprentice systems."

Since backtracking is unnecessary, actions can be selected incrementally using a greedy method without having to precompute a plan. Such an approach is efficient and rapidly adjusts to unforeseen circumstances. Our argument is that cooking tasks are widely encountered in everyday life because of the special properties of a given culture's artifacts. In other words, culture has structured the world so as to make it easier to live in. We present an implementation of these ideas, experimental results, and control experiments using a standard nonlinear planner."

But the complexity, uncertainty, and immediacy of the real world require a central role for moment-to-moment improvisation. But before and beneath any planning ahead, one continually decides what to do now. Investigation of the dynamics of everyday routine activity reveals important regularities in the interaction of very simple machinery with its environment. We have used our dynamic theories to design a program, called Pengi, that engages in complex, apparently planful activity without requiring explicit models of the world."
