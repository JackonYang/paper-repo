With the advent of turbo coding, a third decoding principle has finally had its breakthrough: iterative decoding. With respect to Viterbi decoding, a code is most naturally described by means of a trellis diagram. The main thesis of the present paper is that, with respect to iterative decoding, the natural way of describing a code is by means of a Tanner graph, which may be viewed as a generalized trellis. More precisely, it is the \"time axis\" of a trellis that is generalized to a Tanner graph."

A graph is shown which specifies carefully chosen subsets of the digits of the new codes that must be codewords in one of the shorter subcodes. Lower bounds to the rate and the minimum distance of the new code are derived in terms of the parameters of the graph and the subeodes. Both the encoders and decoders proposed are shown to take advantage of the code's explicit decomposition into subcodes to decompose and simplify the associated computational processes. Bounds on the performance of two specific decoding algorithms are established, and the asymptotic growth of the complexity of decoding for two types of codes and decoders is analyzed. The proposed decoders are able to make effective use of probabilistic information supplied by the channel receiver, e.g., reliability information, without greatly increasing the number of computations required. It is shown that choosing a transmission order for the digits that is appropriate for the graph and the subcodes can give the code excellent burst-error correction abilities.

The algorithm is developed in a general setting of certain operations and functions defined on the set of trellises; it therefore applies to both linear and nonlinear codes, and accommodates a broad range of optimality criteria. The optimality criterion based on minimizing the number of operations required for trellis decoding of C is investigated in detail.

Fifty years of efforts and invention have finally produced coding schemes that closely approach Shannon's channel capacity limit on AWGN channels, both power-limited and band-limited. Similar gains are being achieved in other important applications, such as wireless channels. This course is divided in two parts. In the first part, we remind students of the basics of the theory of linear codes for conventional memoryless ergodic channels. We then introduce more advanced notions so as to make comprehensible some of the most recent coding schemes proposed in the literature. In the second part, we expound the principles of coded modulations for the Gaussian channel and, if time permits, for Rician and Rayleigh fading channels (fully interleaved). We will conclude the course by evoking some aspects of code design for non-ergodic block-fading channels.

We present a new lower bound on the state complexity of linear codes, which includes most of the existing bounds as special cases. The new bound is obtained by dividing the time axis for the code into several sections of varying lengths, as opposed to the division into two sections-the past and the future-employed in the well-known DLP bounds. For a large number of codes this results in a considerable improvement upon the DLP bound. Moreover, we generalize the new bound to nonlinear codes, and introduce several alternative techniques for lower-bounding the trellis complexity, based on the distance spectrum and other combinatorial properties of the code. We also show how the general ideas developed in this paper may be employed to lower-bound the maximum and the total number of branches in the trellis, leading to considerably tighter bounds on these quantities. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the new bounds is investigated, and shown to improve upon the previously known asymptotic estimates of trellis state-complexity."

Among the quasi-cyclic codes are the quadratic residue codes, Reed\u2013Solomon codes and optimal BCH codes. The constraint length K for the convolutional encoding of many of these codes (Golay, (48, 24) OR, etc.) turns out to be surprisingly small. Thus using the soft decoding techniques for convolutional decoding we now have a new maximum likelihood decoding algorithm for many block codes. Conversely an optimal quasi-cyclic code will yield a convolutional encoding with optimal local properties and therefore with good infinite convolutional coding properties."

With this reliability indicator the modified VA produces soft decisions to be used in the decoding of outer codes. The inner software output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) accepts and delivers soft sample values and can be regraded as a device for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, similar to an FM demodulator. Several applications are investigated to show the gain over the conventional hard-deciding VA, including concatenated convolutional codes, concatenation of trellis-coded modulation with convolutional FEC (forward error correcting) codes, and coded Viterbi equalization. For these applications additional gains of 1-4 dB as compared to the classical hard-deciding algorithms were found. For comparison, the more complex symbol-to-symbol MAP, whose optimal a posteriori probabilities can be transformed into soft outputs, was investigated.<<ETX>>"

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

The input bits to the first encoder are scrambled by the interleaver before entering the second encoder. The codeword of the parallel concatenated code consists of the input bits to the first encoder followed by the parity check bits of both encoders. This construction can be generalized to any number of constituent codes. Parallel concatenated schemes employing two convolutional codes as constituent codes, in connection with an iterative decoding algorithm of complexity comparable to that of the constituent codes, have been previously shown to yield remarkable coding gains close to theoretical limits. They have been named, and are known as, \"turbo codes\". We propose a method to evaluate an upper bound to the bit error probability of a parallel concatenated coding scheme averaged over all interleavers of a given length. The analytical bounding technique is then used to shed some light on some crucial questions, which have been floating around in the communications community since the proposal of turbo codes."

For a large number of codes this results in a considerable improvement upon the DLP bound. Moreover, we generalize the new bound to nonlinear codes, and introduce several alternative techniques for lower bounding the trellis complexity, based on the distance spectrum and other combinatorial properties of the code. We also show how our techniques may be employed to lower bound the maximum and the total number of branches in the trellis. The asymptotic behavior of the new bound is investigated and shown to improve upon the known asymptotic estimates of trellis complexity."

The principal properties of these codes and lattices, including distances, dimensions, partitions, generator matrices, and duality properties, are consequences of the general proper- ties of iterated squaring constructions, which also exhibit the interrelation- ships between codes and lattices of different lengths. An extension called the \"cubing construction\" generates good codes and lattices of lengths N = 3.2\", including the Golay code and Leech lattice, with the use of special bases for 8-space. Another related construction generates the Nordstrom-Robinson code and an analogous 16-dimensional nonlattice packing. These constructions are represented by trellis diagrams that display their structure and interrelationships and that lead to efficient maximum likelihood decoding algorithms. General algebraic methods for determining minimal trellis diagrams of codes, lattices, and partitions are given in an Appendix."

The DLP of a code gives tight bounds on its state and branch complexity profiles under any coordinate ordering; these bounds can often be met.

The family of Barnes-Wall lattices (including D/sub 4/ and E/sub 8/) of lengths N=2/sup n/ and their principal sublattices, which are useful in constructing coset codes, are generated by iteration of a simple construction called the squaring construction. The closely related Reed-Muller codes are generated by the same construction. The principal properties of these codes and lattices are consequences of the general properties of iterated squaring constructions, which also exhibit the interrelationships between codes and lattices of different lengths. An extension called the cubing construction generates good codes and lattices of lengths N=3*2/sup n/, including the Golay code and Leech lattice, with the use of special bases for 8-space. Another related construction generates the Nordstrom-Robinson code and an analogous 16-dimensional nonlattice packing. These constructions are represented by trellis diagrams that display their structure and interrelationships and that lead to efficient maximum-likelihood decoding algorithms. >"

Such channels are said to exhibit memory, i.e., statistical dependence in the occurrence of errors; and thus cannot be adequately represented by the classical memoryless binary symmetric channel. The existence of memory implies additional capacity. To exploit this through efficient coding schemes, it is necessary to describe and model the underlying statistical structure of the error process. This paper reviews various channel models, noting the interaction between channel modeling and error control."
