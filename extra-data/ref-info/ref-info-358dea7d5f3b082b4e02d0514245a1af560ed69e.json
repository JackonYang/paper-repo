This multiple resolution method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The segmentation algorithm used at each resolution is based on maximum a posteriori estimation of the field of pixel classifications, which is modeled as a Markov random field. The maximization is performed by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or blocks of pixels. A texture model is also developed which allows the extraction of a texture statistic for each pixel and is well suited for use with the proposed algorithm. Measurements of algorithm performance under varying conditions of region size and signal-to-noise ratio are presented.<<ETX>>"

Specifically, the paper presents random field models for noisy and textured image data based upon a hierarchy of GD. It then presents dynamic programming based segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images, considering a statistical maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Due to computational concerns, however, sub-optimal versions of the algorithms are devised through simplifying approximations in the model. Since model parameters are needed for the segmentation algorithms, a new parameter estimation technique is developed for estimating the parameters in a GD. Finally, a number of examples are presented which show the usefulness of the Gibbsian model and the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithms and the parameter estimation procedures."

To represent noisy textured images, we propose a hierarchical stochastic model that consists of three levels of random fields: the region process, the texture processes and the noise. The hierarchical model also includes local blurring and nonlinear image transformation as results of the image corrupting effects. Having adopted a statistical model, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is used to find the segmented regions through the restored(noise-free) textured image data. Since the joint a posteriori distribution at hand is a Gibbs distribution, we use simulated annealing as a maximization technique. The simulated annealing based segmentation algorithm presented in this paper can also be viewed as a two-step iterative algorithm in the spirit of the EM algorithm [10]."

This paper presents a multiple resolution algorithm for maximizing the a posteriori probability associated with a class of MRF's. These MRF's combine the smooth regions found in Gaussian random fields with the abrupt boundaries characteristic of discrete valued MRF's. This makes them well suited for modeling image properties which vary smoothly over large regions but change abruptly at object boundaries. The multiple resolution algorithm first performs the maximization at coarse resolution and then proceeds to finer resolutions until the pixel level is reached. Since coarser resolution solutions are used to guide maximization at finer resolutions, the algorithm is resistant to local maxima and has performance equivalent to simulated annealing, but with dramatically reduced computation. In fact, the multiple resolution algorithm has been found to require less computation than local greedy algorithms because constraints propagate more rapidly at coarse resolutions. Regularization of optical flow problems and the restoration of fields corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise are explicitly treated and simulation results are presented."

Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems."

Each of these models is characterized by a set of neighbors, a set of coefficients, and a noise sequence of specified characteristics. We are concerned with two problems: the estimation of the unknown parameters in both SAR and CM models and the choice of an appropriate model from a class of such competing models. Assuming Gaussian-distributed variables, we discuss maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods. In general, the ML scheme leads to nonlinear optimization problems. To avoid excessive computation, an iterative scheme is given for SAR models, which gives approximate ML estimates in the Gaussian case and reasonably good estimates in some non-Gaussian situations as well. Likewise, for CM models, an easily computable consistent estimate is given. The asymptotic mean-squared error (mse) of this estimate for a four-neighbor CM model is shown tn be substantially less than the mse of the popular coding estimate. Asymptotically consistent decision rules are given for choosing an appropriate SAR or CM model. The usefulness of the estimation scheme and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors is illustrated by using synthetic patterns. Synthetic patterns obeying known SAR and CM models are generated, and the models corresponding to true and several competing neighbor sets are fitted. The estimation scheme yields estimates close to the parameters of the true models, and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors picks up the true model from the class of competing models."

                "text": "may 7th, 1986, Professor A. F. M. Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on ..."

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples."
