The data was collected specifically for testing colour-based recognition algorithm and is publicly available. In the conducted experiments on SOIL-47, we evaluate two recognition algoritms; the Multimodal Neighbourhood Signature (MNS) approach and a method based on a Attributed Relational Graph (ARG). The MNS approach represents object appearance by measurements computed from image neighbourhoods with a multimodal colour density function. The ARG approach computes a graph of affine invariant measurements of the colour and shape of segmented image regions. Using only a single model image of each of the 47 objects, MNS performed well even for extreme test views close to degrees. The ARG method assumes a locally planar surface, therefore a second experiment was conducted on a subset of box-like objects of SOIL-47. MNS performance was fairly stable, outperforming ARG for most viewing angles.. Note, that this is the fir st systematic test of MNS with controlled 3D viewpoint change."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

We demonstrate the usefulness of common image search metrics applied on images captured with a camera-equipped mobile device to find matching images on the World Wide Web or other general-purpose databases. Searching the entire Web can be computationally overwhelming, so we devise a hybrid image-and-keyword searching technique. First, image-search is performed over images and links to their source Web pages in a database that indexes only a small fraction of the Web. Then, relevant keywords on these Web pages are automatically identified and submitted to an existing text-based search engine (e.g. Google) that indexes a much larger portion of the Web. Finally, the resulting image set is filtered to retain images close to the original query. It is thus possible to efficiently search hundreds of millions of images that are not only textually related but also visually relevant. We demonstrate our approach on an application allowing users to browse Web pages matching the image of a nearby location."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

A drawback, however, is that certain color invariant values become very unstable in the presence of sensor noise. To suppress the effect of noise for unstable color invariant values, in this paper, histograms are computed by variable kernel density estimators. To apply variable kernel density estimation in a principled way, models are proposed for the propagation of sensor noise through color invariant variables. As a result, the associated uncertainty is obtained for each color invariant value. The associated uncertainty is used to derive the parameterization of the variable kernel for the purpose of robust histogram construction. It is empirically verified that the proposed density estimator compares favorably to traditional histogram schemes for the purpose of object recognition."

Interestingly the spatial configuration of the neighborhood is the basis for the perception of humans. Common practise in color image processing, is to use the color information without considering the spatial structure. We aim at a physical basis for the local interpretation of color images. We propose a framework for spatial color measurement, based on the Gaussian scale-space theory. We consider a Gaussian color model, which inherently uses the spatial and color information in an integrated model. The framework is well-founded in physics as well as in measurement science. The framework delivers sound and robust spatial color invariant features. The usefulness of the proposed measurement framework is illustrated by edge detection, where edges are discriminated as shadow, highlight, or object boundary. Other applications of the framework include color invariant image retrieval and color constant edge detection."

Our method has three distinct advantages: 1) It is computationally superior to the conventional approach. The integral histogram method makes it possible to employ even an exhaustive search process in real-time, which was impractical before. 2) It can be extended to higher data dimensions, uniform and nonuniform bin formations, and multiple target scales without sacrificing its computational advantages. 3) It enables the description of higher level histogram features. We exploit the spatial arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either a scan-line or a wave-front. At each step, we update a single bin using the values of integral histogram at the previously visited neighboring data points. After the integral histogram is propagated, histogram of any target region can be computed easily by using simple arithmetic operations."

Our algorithm first retrieves the results of a keyword query from an existing image search engine, clusters the results based on extracted image features, and returns the cluster that is inferred to be the most relevant to the search query.

A Gaussian model for skin detection is a well-known approach with its simplicity and generality. In this paper, we discuss limitations of the Gaussian model and suggest a new statistical color model for skin detection, called an elliptical boundary model. The suggested model overcomes the limitations of the Gaussian model with better performance. From the experiment performed on six chrominance spaces, it gives the much higher correct detection ratio than a single Gaussian model. As compared to the mixture of Gaussian model suggested to improve the correct detection ratio of a single Gaussian at the expense of slower speed, the elliptical boundary model still gives the better correct detection ratio with faster speed."

Our emphasis is on wide-ranging, robust metrics which can be used for evaluation purposes without inducing any bias towards the evaluation results. The goal is to report a set of unbiased metrics and to leave the final evaluation of the evaluation process to the research community analyzing the results, keeping the human in the loop. We propose metrics from statistical detection and estimation theory tailored to object detection and tracking tasks using frame-based as well as object-based evaluation paradigms. Object correspondences between multiple ground truth objects to multiple tracker result objects are established from a correspondence matrix. The correspondence matrix is built using three different methods of distance computation between trajectories. Results on PETS 2001 data set are presented in terms of 1st and 2nd order statistical descriptors of these metrics."

As an example, the algorithm is applied to lion faces. The detection algorithm is based on a human face detection method, utilising Haar-like features and AdaBoost classifiers. The face tracking is implemented by applying a specific interest model that combines low-level feature tracking with the detection algorithm. By combining the two methods in a specific tracking model, reliable and temporally coherent detection/tracking of animal faces is achieved. The information generated by the tracker is used to automatically annotate the animal's locomotive behaviour. The annotation classes of locomotive processes for a given animal species are predefined by a large semantic taxonomy on wildlife domain. The experimental results are presented."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

However, color provides valuable information in object description and matching tasks. Many objects can be misclassified if their color contents are ignored. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel colored local invariant feature descriptor. Instead of using the gray space to represent the input image, the proposed approach builds the SIFT descriptors in a color invariant space. The built Colored SIFT (CSIFT) is more robust than the conventional SIFT with respect to color and photometrical variations. The evaluation results support the potential of the proposed approach."
