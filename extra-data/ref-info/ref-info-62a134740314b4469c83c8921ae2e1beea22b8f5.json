These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

The traditional approach, focusing on the correct classification of isolated characters, has been exhausted. The demonstration of the superiority of a new classification method under operational conditions requires large experimental facilities and databases beyond the resources of most researchers. In any case, even perfect classification of individual characters is insufficient for the conversion of complex archival documents to a useful computer-readable form. Many practical OCR tasks require integrated treatment of entire documents and well-organized typographic and domain-specific knowledge. New OCR systems should take advantage of the typographic uniformity of paragraphs or other layout components. They should also exploit the unavoidable interaction with human operators to improve themselves without explicit 'training'. >"

The combination technique uses these rankings to determine a small subset of the set of classes that contains the correct class. A group consensus function is then applied to re-rank the elements in the subset. This methodology is especially suited for recognition systems with large numbers of classes where it is valuable to reduce the decision problem to a manageable size before making a final determination about the identity of the image. Experimentation is discussed in which the proposed method is used with a word recognition problem where 40 classifiers are applied to degraded machine-printed word images and where a typical lexicon contains 235 words. A 96.6% correct rate is achieved within the 10 best decisions for 817 test images."
