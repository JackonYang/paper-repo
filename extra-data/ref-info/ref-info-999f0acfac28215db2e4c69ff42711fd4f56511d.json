Traditionally, such information is computed using off-the-shelf discourse analyzers. This design provides limited opportunities for guiding the discourse parser based on the requirements of the target task. In contrast, our model induces relations between sentences while optimizing a task-specific objective. This approach enables the model to benefit from discourse information without relying on explicit annotations of discourse structure during training. The model jointly identifies relevant sentences, establishes relations between them and predicts an answer. We implement this idea in a discriminative framework with hidden variables that capture relevant sentences and relations unobserved during training. Our experiments demonstrate that the discourse aware model outperforms state-of-the-art machine comprehension systems.1"

Rather than using syntactic features to augment existing statistical classifiers (as in previous work), we build on the idea that questions and their (correct) answers relate to each other via loose but predictable syntactic transformations. We propose a probabilistic quasi-synchronous grammar, inspired by one proposed for machine translation (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006), and parameterized by mixtures of a robust nonlexical syntax/alignment model with a(n optional) lexical-semantics-driven log-linear model. Our model learns soft alignments as a hidden variable in discriminative training. Experimentalresultsusing theTRECdataset are shown to significantly outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines."

Machine comprehension evaluates the system\u2019s ability to understand text through a series of question-answering tasks on short pieces of text such that the correct answer can be found only in the given text. For this task, we posit that there is a hidden (latent) structure that explains the relation between the question, correct answer, and text. We call this the answer-entailing structure; given the structure, the correctness of the answer is evident. Since the structure is latent, it must be inferred. We present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer machine comprehension questions on novel texts. We extend this framework to incorporate multi-task learning on the different subtasks that are required to perform machine comprehension. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that our framework outperforms various IR and neuralnetwork baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 67.8% (vs. 59.9%, the best previously-published result.)"

The original model requires that the sentences supporting the answer be explicitly indicated during training. In contrast, our approach only requires the answer to the question during training. We apply the model to the synthetic bAbI tasks, showing that our approach is competitive with the supervised approach, particularly when trained on a sufficiently large amount of data. Furthermore, it decisively beats other weakly supervised approaches based on LSTMs. The approach is quite general and can potentially be applied to many other tasks that require capturing long-term dependencies."

In this paper, we investigate the use of continuous word representations as features for dependency parsing. We compare several popular embeddings to Brown clusters, via multiple types of features, in both news and web domains. We find that all embeddings yield significant parsing gains, including some recent ones that can be trained in a fraction of the time of others. Explicitly tailoring the representations for the task leads to further improvements. Moreover, an ensemble of all representations achieves the best results, suggesting their complementarity."

                "text": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone\u2019s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today\u2019s computers and algorithms."

Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset of Cai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline."

It finds words that evoke FrameNet frames, selects frames for them, and locates the arguments for each frame. The system uses two feature-based, discriminative probabilistic (log-linear) models, one with latent variables to permit disambiguation of new predicate words. The parser is demonstrated to significantly outperform previously published results."

To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks."

To efficiently extract sequences of edits, we employ a tree kernel as a heuristic in a greedy search routine. We describe a logistic regression model that uses 33 syntactic features of edit sequences to classify the sentence pairs. The approach leads to competitive performance in recognizing textual entailment, paraphrase identification, and answer selection for question answering."

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."

We solve the problem of frame-semantic parsing using a two-stage statistical model that takes lexical targets (i.e., content words and phrases) in their sentential contexts and predicts frame-semantic structures. Given a target in context, the first stage disambiguates it to a semantic frame. This model uses latent variables and semi-supervised learning to improve frame disambiguation for targets unseen at training time. The second stage finds the target's locally expressed semantic arguments. At inference time, a fast exact dual decomposition algorithm collectively predicts all the arguments of a frame at once in order to respect declaratively stated linguistic constraints, resulting in qualitatively better structures than na\u00efve local predictors. Both components are feature-based and discriminatively trained on a small set of annotated frame-semantic parses. On the SemEval 2007 benchmark data set, the approach, along with a heuristic identifier of frame-evoking targets, outperforms the prior state of the art by significant margins. Additionally, we present experiments on the much larger FrameNet 1.5 data set. We have released our frame-semantic parser as open-source software."

To define the slots, domain experts and professional annotators are often involved, and the cost can be expensive. In this paper, we ask the following question: given a collection of unlabeled raw audios, can we use the frame semantics theory to automatically induce and fill the semantic slots in an unsupervised fashion? To do this, we propose the use of a state-of-the-art frame-semantic parser, and a spectral clustering based slot ranking model that adapts the generic output of the parser to the target semantic space. Empirical experiments on a real-world spoken dialogue dataset show that the automatically induced semantic slots are in line with the reference slots created by domain experts: we observe a mean averaged precision of 69.36% using ASR-transcribed data. Our slot filling evaluations also indicate the promising future of this proposed approach."

This was the attempt of the QA4MRE challenge which was run as a Lab at CLEF 2011. This year a major innovation was introduced, as the traditional QA task was replaced by a new Machine Reading task whose intention was to ask questions which required a deep knowledge of individual short texts and in which systems were required to choose one answer, by analysing the corresponding test document in conjunction with the background collections provided by the organization. Beside the main task, also one pilot task was offered, namely, Processing Modality and Negation for Machine Reading. This task was aimed at evaluating whether systems were able to understand extra-propositional aspects of meaning like modality and negation. This paper describes the preparation of the data sets, the creation of the background collections to allow systems to acquire the required knowledge, the metric used for the evaluation of the systems' submissions, and the results of this first attempt. Twelve groups participated in the task submitting a total of 62 runs in three languages: English, German and Romanian."

First, we show that Q/A systems perform better when there are multiple answer opportunities per question. Next, we analyze common approaches to two subproblems: term overlap for answer sentence identification, and answer typing for short answer extraction. We present general tools for analyzing the strengths and limitations of techniques for these sub-problems. Our results quantify the limitations of both term overlap and answer typing to distinguish between competing answer candidates."

In this talk, I will explore the hypothesis that a multilingual representation can enrich the feature space for natural language processing tasks, and lead to significant improvements over traditional solutions that rely exclusively on a monolingual representation. Specifically, I will describe experiments performed on three different tasks: word sense disambiguation, subjectivity analysis, and text semantic similarity, and show how the use of a multilingual representation can leverage additional information from the languages in the multilingual space, and thus improve over the use of only one language at a time.

However, using these new tests in classrooms introduces many challenges, one of which is that they usually lack practice exercises and assessments. Here, we address part of this challenge by automating the creation of specific type of assessment item. \nSpecifically, we focus automatically generating factual WH questions. Our goal is to create an automated system that can take as input a text and produce as output questions for assessing a reader's knowledge of the information in the text. The questions could then be presented to a teacher, who could select and revise the ones that he or she judges to be useful. \nAfter introducing the problem, we describe some of the computational and linguistic challenges presented by factual question generation. We then present an implemented system that leverages existing natural language processing techniques to address some of these challenges. The system uses a combination or manually encoded transformation rules and a statistical question ranker trained on a tailored dataset of labeled system output. \nWe present experiments that evaluate individual components of the system as well as the system as a whole. We found, among other things, that the question ranker roughly doubled the acceptability rate of top-ranked questions. \nIn a user study, we tested whether K-12 teachers could efficiently create factual questions by selecting and revising suggestions from the system. Offering automatic suggestions reduced the time and effort spent by participants, though it also affected the types or questions that were created. \nThis research supports the idea that natural language processing can help teachers efficiently create instructional content. It provides solutions to some of the major challenges in question generation and an analysis and better understanding of those that remain."

Our sieve architecture applies a battery of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision, where each model builds on the previous model's cluster output. The two stages of our sieve-based architecture, a mention detection stage that heavily favors recall, followed by coreference sieves that are precision-oriented, offer a powerful way to achieve both high precision and high recall. Further, our approach makes use of global information through an entity-centric model that encourages the sharing of features across all mentions that point to the same real-world entity. Despite its simplicity, our approach gives state-of-the-art performance on several corpora and genres, and has also been incorporated into hybrid state-of-the-art coreference systems for Chinese and Arabic. Our system thus offers a new paradigm for combining knowledge in rule-based systems that has implications throughout computational linguistics."

                "text": "This paper describes our entry to the 2012 QA4MRE Main Task (English dataset). The QA4MRE task poses a significant challenge as the expression of knowledge in the question and answer (in the document) typically substantially differs. Ultimately, one would need a system that can perform full machine reading \u2013 creating an internal model of the document\u2019s meaning \u2013 to achieve high performance. Our approach is a preliminary step toward this, based on estimating the likelihood of textual entailment between sentences in the text, and the question Q and each candidate answer Ai. We first treat the question Q and each answer Ai independently, and find sets of sentences SQ, SA that each plausibly entail (the target of) Q or one of the Ai respectively. We then search for the closest (in the document) pair of sentences in these sets, and conclude that the answer Ai entailed by SAi in the closest pair is the answer. This approach assumes coherent discourse, i.e., that sentences close together are usually \u201ctalking about the same thing\u201d, and thus conveying a single idea (namely an expression of the Q+Ai pair). In QA4MRE it is hard to \"prove\" entailment, as a candidate answer A may be expressed using a substantially different wording in the document, over multiple sentences, and only partially (as some aspects of A may be left implicit in the document, to be filled in by the reader). As a result, we instead estimate the likelihood of entailment (that a sentence S entails A) by look for evidence, namely entailment relationships between components of S and A such as words, bigrams, trigrams, and parse fragments. To identify these possible entailment relationships we use three knowledge resources, namely WordNet, ParaPara (a large paraphrase database from Johns Hopkins University), and the DIRT paraphrase database. Our best run scored 40% in the evaluation, and around 42% in additional (unsubmitted) runs afterwards. In ablation studies, we found that the majority of our score (approximately 38%) could be attributed to the basic algorithm, with the knowledge resources adding approximately 4% to this baseline score. Finally we critique our approach with respect to the broader goal of machine reading, and discuss what is needed to move closer to that goal."

Not only do these features generalize poorly, but the cost of feature computation restricts parsing speed significantly. In this work, we propose a novel way of learning a neural network classifier for use in a greedy, transition-based dependency parser. Because this classifier learns and uses just a small number of dense features, it can work very fast, while achieving an about 2% improvement in unlabeled and labeled attachment scores on both English and Chinese datasets. Concretely, our parser is able to parse more than 1000 sentences per second at 92.2% unlabeled attachment score on the English Penn Treebank."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

This was the attempt of the QA4MRE challenge which was run as a Lab at CLEF 2011---2013. The traditional QA task was replaced by a new Machine Reading task, whose intention was to ask questions that required a deep knowledge of individual short texts and in which systems were required to choose one answer, by analysing the corresponding test document in conjunction with background text collections provided by the organization. Four different tasks have been organized during these years: Main Task, Processing Modality and Negation for Machine Reading, Machine Reading of Biomedical Texts about Alzheimer's disease, and Entrance Exams. This paper describes their motivation, their goals, their methodology for preparing the data sets, their background collections, their metrics used for the evaluation, and the lessons learned along these three years."

Stop words are removed from each H and query words are identified to retrieve the most relevant sentences from the associated document using Lucene. Relevant sentences are retrieved from the associated document based on the TF-IDF of the matching query words along with n-gram overlap of the sentence with the H. Each retrieved sentence defines the Text T. Each T-H pair is assigned a ranking score that works on textual entailment principle. A validate weight is automatically assigned to each answer options based on their ranking. A parallel procedure also generates the possible answer patterns from given questions and answer options. Each sentence in the associated document is assigned an inference score with respect to each answer pattern. Evaluated inference score for each answer option is multiplied by the validate weight based on their ranking. The answer option that receives the highest selection score is identified as the most relevant option and selected as the answer to the given question."

The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA."

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems."

                "text": "We study how to use the BFGS quasi-Newton matrices to precondition minimization methods for problems where the storage is critical. We give an update formula which generates matrices using information from the last m iterations, where m is any number supplied by the user. The quasi-Newton matrix is updated at every iteration by dropping the oldest information and replacing it by the newest informa- tion. It is shown that the matrices generated have some desirable properties. The resulting algorithms are tested numerically and compared with several well- known methods. 1. Introduction. For the problem of minimizing an unconstrained function / of n variables, quasi-Newton methods are widely employed (4). They construct a se- quence of matrices which in some way approximate the hessian of /(or its inverse). These matrices are symmetric; therefore, it is necessary to have n(n + l)/2 storage locations for each one. For large dimensional problems it will not be possible to re- tain the matrices in the high speed storage of a computer, and one has to resort to other kinds of algorithms. For example, one could use the methods (Toint (15), Shanno (12)) which preserve the sparsity structure of the hessian, or conjugate gradient methods (CG) which only have to store 3 or 4 vectors. Recently, some CG algorithms have been developed which use a variable amount of storage and which do not require knowledge about the sparsity structure of the problem (2), (7), (8). A disadvantage of these methods is that after a certain number of iterations the quasi-Newton matrix is discarded, and the algorithm is restarted using an initial matrix (usually a diagonal matrix). We describe an algorithm which uses a limited amount of storage and where the quasi-Newton matrix is updated continuously. At every step the oldest information contained in the matrix is discarded and replaced by new one. In this way we hope to have a more up to date model of our function. We will concentrate on the BFGS method since it is considered to be the most efficient. We believe that similar algo- rithms cannot be developed for the other members of the Broyden 0-class (1). Let / be the function to be nnnimized, g its gradient and h its hessian. We define"
