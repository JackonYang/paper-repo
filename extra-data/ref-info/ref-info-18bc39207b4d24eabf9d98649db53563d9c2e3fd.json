We extend traditional reaction-diffusion systems by allowing anisotropic and spatially non-uniform diffusion, as well as multiple competing directions of diffusion. We adapt reaction-diffusion system to the needs of computer graphics by presenting a method to synthesize patterns which compensate for the effects of non-uniform surface parameterization. Finally, we develop efficient algorithms for simulating reaction-diffusion systems and display a collection of resulting textures using standard texture- and displacement-mapping techniques."

In this image a rectangular areacomposed of small X-shaped patterns appears as a distinctregion against a background of L-shaped patterns. Thissegregation occurs rapidly and unconsciously, without effort or search. The rectangular area composed of T- shaped patterns, however, does not appear as a distinct region in this sense. It is very easy to discriminate amongall three pattems, but only the X and L regions displayspontaneous segregation. This distinction between pat- tern discrimination and perceptual segregation gives par-ticular interest to the study of this aspect of visual textureperception. Other aspects of texture perception include the role of texture in the perception of surface orientation and shape and the influence of surface texture in de-termining color appearance. In this paper we limit con-sideration to the phenomenon of segregation.Pure texture-based segregation is not a very importantphenomenon in everyday visual experience. Objects are not usually distinguished from their backgrounds purely by textural differences. In this respect, the study of puretexture differences (in the absence of differences in bright-ness, color, depth, or other properties) is analogous to thestudy of isoluminant color differences, which also are notvery common in natural scenes. The relative rarity ofisoluminant color discrimination in the real world does not imply that color perception is an unimportant compo-nent of seeing. Similarly, the rarity of pure texture differ-ences does not reduce the potential importance of textureperception, especially in the visual processing of complexscenes."

Theories have been developed to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However, Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned responses they are easy to discriminate."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Reaction-diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse at unequal rates over a surface and react with one another to form stable patterns such as spots and stripes. Biologists and mathematicians have explored the patterns made by several reaction-diffusion systems. We extend the range of textures that have previously been generated by using a cascade of multiple reaction-diffusion systems in which one system lays down an initial pattern and then one or more later systems refine the pattern. Examples of patterns generated by such a cascade process include the clusters of spots on leopards known as rosettes and the web-like patterns found on giraffes. In addition, this paper introduces a method which reaction-diffusion textures are created to match the geometry of an arbitrary polyhedral surface. This is accomplished by creating a mesh over a given surface and then simulating the reaction-diffusion process directly on this mesh. This avoids the often difficult task of assigning texture coordinates to a complex surface. A mesh is generated by evenly distributing points over the model using relaxation and then determining which points are adjacent by constructing their Voronoi regions. Textures are rendered directly from the mesh by using a weighted sum of mesh values to compute surface color at a given position. Such textures can also be used as bump maps."

Eye movements are prevented by a very brief presentation of the stimulus, and the inspection interval is terminated by a presentation of a masking pattern. It is shown that detection of a single vertical target line segment, embedded in an array of differently oriented background segments, improves with the increase of mask delay. The reduction of the area in which the target may lie reduces the inspection time that is required to determine the target's presence or absence. The phenomena are invariant under changes of the spatial scale within the fovea and parafovea. These results are interpreted in the context of a model in which the diameter of the area which can be searched in parallel is proportional to the distance in a feature space between the target and background elements. The geometry of this feature space is similar to the functional architecture of the visual cortex. A theory of texture perception based on a qualitative all-or-none feature space of textons is described. A quantitative model that is shown to be essentially equivalent to the previous theory in the limiting case of very large feature differences is proposed."
