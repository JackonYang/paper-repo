PowerAqua is an open multi-ontology Question Answering (QA) system for the Semantic Web (SW). However, the emergence of Linked Data, characterized by its openness, heterogeneity and scale, introduces a new dimension to the Semantic Web scenario, in which exploiting the relevant information to extract answers for Natural Language (NL) user queries is a major challenge. In this paper we discuss the issues and lessons learned from our experience of integrating PowerAqua as a front-end for DBpedia and a subset of Linked Data sources. As such, we go one step beyond the state of the art on end-users interfaces for Linked Data by introducing mapping and fusion techniques needed to translate a user query by means of multiple sources. Our first informal experiments probe whether, in fact, it is feasible to obtain answers to user queries by composing information across semantic sources and Linked Data, even in its current form, where the strength of Linked Data is more a by-product of its size than its quality. We believe our experiences can be extrapolated to a variety of end-user applications that wish to scale, open up, exploit and re-use what possibly is the greatest wealth of data about everything in the history of Artificial Intelligence."

In this paper we provide two novel contributions: First, we detail a new component of the system, the Triple Similarity Service, which is able to match queries effectively to triples found in different ontologies on the Semantic Web. Second, we provide a first evaluation of the system, which in addition to providing data about PowerAqua's competence, also gives us important insights into the issues related to using the Semantic Web as the target answer set in Question Answering. In particular, we show that, despite the problems related to the noisy and incomplete conceptualizations, which can be found on the Semantic Web, good results can already be obtained."

Especially novice users need to acquire both knowledge about the underlying ontology structure and proficiency in formulating formal queries (e. g. SPARQL queries) to retrieve information from Linked Data sources. So as to simplify and automate the querying and retrieval of information from such sources, we present in this paper a novel approach for constructing SPARQL queries based on user-supplied keywords. Our approach utilizes a set of predefined basic graph pattern templates for generating adequate interpretations of user queries. This is achieved by obtaining ranked lists of candidate resource identifiers for the supplied keywords and then injecting these identifiers into suitable positions in the graph pattern templates. The main advantages of our approach are that it is completely agnostic of the underlying knowledge base and ontology schema, that it scales to large knowledge bases and is simple to use. We evaluate17 possible valid graph pattern templates by measuring their precision and recall on 53 queries against DBpedia. Our results show that 8 of these basic graph pattern templates return results with a precision above 70%. Our approach is implemented as a Web search interface and performs sufficiently fast to return instant answers to the user even with large knowledge bases."

The availability of semantic markup on the web also opens the way to novel, sophisticated forms of question answering. AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input and returns answers drawn from one or more knowledge bases (KBs), which instantiate the input ontology with domain-specific information. AquaLog makes use of the GATE NLP platform, string metrics algorithms, WordNet and a novel ontology-based relation similarity service to make sense of user queries with respect to the target knowledge base. Finally, although AquaLog has primarily been designed for use with semantic web languages, it makes use of a generic plug-in mechanism, which means it can be easily interfaced to different ontology servers and knowledge representation platforms."

The user's choices are used for training the system in order to improve its performance over time. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of FREyA to query the Linked Open Data.

This is closely related to the ability to easily formulate queries over those knowledge bases. We explain benefits and drawbacks of existing techniques in achieving this goal and then present the QTL algorithm, which fills a gap in research and practice. It uses supervised machine learning and allows users to ask queries without knowing the schema of the underlying knowledge base beforehand and without expertise in the SPARQL query language. We then present the AutoSPARQL user interface, which implements an active learning approach on top of QTL.

However, together with its opportunities, Linked Data brings inherent challenges in the way users and applications consume the available data. Users consuming Linked Data on the Web, or on corporate intranets, should be able to search and query data spread over potentially a large number of heterogeneous, complex and distributed datasets. Ideally, a query mechanism for Linked Data should abstract users from the representation of data. This work focuses on the investigation of a vocabulary independent natural language query mechanism for Linked Data, using an approach based on the combination of entity search, a Wikipediabased semantic relatedness measure and spreading activation. The combination of these three elements in a query mechanism for Linked Data is a new contribution in the space. Wikipedia-based relatedness measures address existing limitations of existing works which are based on similarity measures/term expansion based on WordNet. Experimental results using the query mechanism to answer 50 natural language queries over DBPedia achieved a mean reciprocal rank of 61.4%, an average precision of 48.7% and average recall of 57.2%, answering 70% of the queries."

Several recent studies have shown user preference to Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) in comparison to others. Although many NLIs to ontologies have been developed, those that have reasonable performance are domain-specific and tend to require customisation for each new domain which, from a developer's perspective, makes them expensive to maintain. We present our system FREyA, which combines syntactic parsing with the knowledge encoded in ontologies in order to reduce the customisation effort. If the system fails to automatically derive an answer, it will generate clarification dialogs for the user. The user's selections are saved and used for training the system in order to improve its performance over time. FREyA is evaluated using Mooney Geoquery dataset with very high precision and recall."

Thus, they encompass solely a small fraction of the information available on the document-oriented Web. In this paper, we present BOA, an iterative bootstrapping strategy for extracting RDF from unstructured data. The idea behind BOA is to use the Data Web as background knowledge for the extraction of natural language patterns that represent predicates found on the Data Web. These patterns are used to extract instance knowledge from natural language text. This knowledge is nally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. We evaluate our approach on two data sets using DBpedia as background knowledge. Our results show that we can extract several thousand new facts in one iteration with very high accuracy. Moreover, we provide the rst repository of natural language representations of predicates found on the Data Web."

Instead of keyword search and browsing along links between results, users can specify the needs in terms of complex queries and obtain precise answers right away. However, users might not always know the query language and more importantly, the schema underlying the data. Motivated by the burden facing the data Web search users in specifying complex information needs, we identify a particular class of search approaches that follow a paradigm that we refer to as schema-agnostic. Common to these search approaches is that no knowledge about the schema is required to specify complex information needs. We have conducted a systematic study of four popular approaches: (1) simple keyword search, (2) faceted search, (3) result completion, which is based on computing complex answers as candidate results for user provided keywords, and (4) query completion, which is based on computing structured queries as candidate interpretations of user provided keywords. We study these approaches from a process-oriented view to derive the main conceptual steps required for addressing complex information needs. Then, we perform an experimental study based on established conduct of a task-based evaluation to assess the effectiveness, efficiency and usability."

We present Sindice, a lookup index over resources crawled on the Semantic Web. Our index allows applications to automatically retrieve sources with information about a given resource. In addition we allow resource retrieval through inverse-functional properties, offer full-text search and index SPARQL endpoints."

We propose Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of texts in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia. We use machine learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as a weighted vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments: from r = 0.56 to 0.75 for individual words and from r = 0.60 to 0.72 for texts. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users."

                "text": "Most current linguistic theories give lexical accounts of several phenomena that used to be considered purely syntactic. The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased both in amount and complexity. We explore the view that syntactic rules are not separated from lexical items. In this approach, each elementary structure is associated with a lexical item called the anchor. These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to context-free grammars) over which constraints can be stated. The 'grammar' consists of a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the anchor. There are 'rules' which tell us how these structures are composed. A grammar of this form will be said to be lexicalized. \nThe process of lexicalization of context-free grammars (CFGs) constrained by linguistic requirements forces us to use operations for combining structures that make the formalism fall in the class of mildly context sensitive languages. We show that substitution, the combining operation corresponding to CFGs, does not allow one to lexicalize CFGs but the combination of substitution and adjunction does. We show how tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) is derived from the lexicalization process of CFGs. Then we show that TAGs are closed under lexicalization and we illustrate the main structures found in a lexicalized TAG for English. The properties of TAGs permit us to encapsulate diverse syntactic phenomena in a very natural way. TAG's extended domain of locality and its factoring of recursion from local dependencies enable us to localize many syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap) as well as semantic dependencies (such as predicate-arguments). \nWe investigate the processing of lexicalized TAGs. We first present two general practical parsers that follow Earley-style parsing. They are practical parsers for TAGs because, as for CFGs, the average behavior of Earley-type parsers is superior to its worst case complexity. They are both left to right bottom-up parsers that use top-down predictions but they differ in the way the top down prediction is used. \nThen we explain the building of a set of deterministic bottom-up left to right parsers which analyze a subset of tree-adjoining languages. The LR parsing strategy for CFGs is extended to TAG by using a machine, called Bottom-up Embedded Push Down Automaton (BEPDA), that recognizes in a bottom-up fashion the set of tree-adjoining languages (and exactly this set). \nFinally we show how lexicalized grammars suggest a natural two-step parsing strategy. We consider lexicalized TAGs as an instance of lexicalized grammar and we examine the effect of the two-step parsing strategy on main types of parsing algorithms."
