The algorithm we present is a generalization of the ,K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in a n iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an eight-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces, show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented and results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details. They can be used in image recognition and as crude representations of the image. The caricatures are easy to display or print using a few grey levels and can be coded very efficiently. In particular, segmentation of faces results in binary sketches which preserve the main characteristics of the face, so that it is easily recognizable. I. INTRODUCTION E present a technique for segmenting a grey-scale image (typically 2.56 levels) into regions of uniform or slowly varying intensity. The segmented image consists of very few levels (typically 2-4). each denoting a different region, as shown in Fig. 1. It is a sketch, or caricature, of the original image which preserves its most significant features, while removing unimportant details. It can thus be the first stage of an image recognition system. However, assuming that the segmented image retains the intelligibility of the original, it can also be used as a crude representation of the image. The caricature has the advantage that it is easy to display or print with very few grey levels. The number of levels is crucial for special display media like paper, cloth, and binary computer screens. Also, the caricature can be coded very efficiently , since we only have to code the transitions between a few grey levels.

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

Our method uses local criteria and yet produces results that reflect global properties of the image. We develop a framework that provides specific definitions of what it means for an image to be under- or over-segmented. We then present an efficient algorithm for computing a segmentation that is neither under- nor over-segmented according to these definitions. Our segmentation criterion is based on intensity differences between neighboring pixels. An important characteristic of the approach is that it is able to preserve detail in low-variability regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions, which we illustrate with several examples on both real and synthetic images."

It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image."

The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images.

The detected regions are homogeneous and surrounded by closed edge contours. Previous approaches to multiscale segmentation represent an image at different scales using a scale-space. However, structure is only represented implicitly in this representation, structures at coarser scales are inherently smoothed, and the problem of structure extraction is unaddressed. This paper argues that the issues of scale selection and structure detection cannot be treated separately. A new concept of scale is presented that represents image structures at different scales, and not the image itself. This scale is integrated into a nonlinear transform which makes structure explicit in the transformed domain. Structures that are stable (locally invariant) to changes in scale are identified as being perceptually relevant. The transform can be viewed as collecting spatially distributed evidence for edges and regions, and making it available at contour locations, thereby facilitating integrated detection of edges and regions without restrictive models of geometry or homogeneity. In this sense, it performs Gestalt analysis. All scale parameters of the transform are automatically determined, and the structure of any arbitrary geometry can be identified without any smoothing, even at coarse scales."

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging filter modulated by a measure of the signal discontinuity at each point. This process is related to the anisotropic diffusion reported by P. Perona and J. Malik (1987) but it has a much simpler formulation and is not subject to instability or divergence. Real examples show how this approach can be applied to the smoothing of various types of signals. The detected features do not move, and thus no tracking is needed. The last property makes it possible to derive a novel scale-space representation of a signal using a small number of scales. Finally, this process is easily implemented on parallel architectures: the running time on a 16 K connection machine is three orders of magnitude faster than on a serial machine.<<ETX>>"

For Gaussian kernels, mean shift is a gradient mapping. Convergence is studied for mean shift iterations. Cluster analysis if treated as a deterministic problem of finding a fixed point of mean shift that characterizes the data. Applications in clustering and Hough transform are demonstrated. Mean shift is also considered as an evolutionary strategy that performs multistart global optimization. >"

Computer vision algorithms that are intended to form part of a perceptual user interface must be fast and efficient. They must be able to track in real time and yet not absorb a major share of computational resources. An efficient, new algorithm is described here based on the mean shift algorithm. The mean shift algorithm robustly finds the mode (peak) of probability distributions. We first describe histogram based methods of producing object probability distributions. In our case, we want to track the mode of an object's probability distribution within a video scene. Since the probability distribution of the object can change and move dynamically in time, the mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with dynamically changing probability distributions. The modified algorithm is called the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm. CAMSHIFT is then used as an interface for games and graphics."

Conditions on the kernel functions are derived to guarantee asymptotic unbiasedness, consistency, and uniform consistency of the estimates. The results are generalized to obtain a simple mcan-shift estimate that can be extended in a k -nearest-neighbor approach. Applications of gradient estimation to pattern recognition are presented using clustering and intrinsic dimensionality problems, with the ultimate goal of providing further understanding of these problems in terms of density gradients."
