We describe an approach called word spotting which involves grouping word images into clusters of similar words by using image matching to find similarity. By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques. It is shown in a subset of the George Washington collection that such a word spotting technique can outperform a Hidden Markov Model word-based recognition technique in terms of word error rates."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents)."

Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on off-line printed and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, which leads to a significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

Documents range from ancient manuscripts, through early printed books, to typewritten administrative documents of the twentieth century. A common thread is that the documents are typically valued for their physical appearance as much as their content. The documents to be analysed can be originals (paper, parchment, etc.) or in image form (already scanned, possibly using now outdated technology). The key requirement is to be able to process these unique manuscripts, whether they are presented as free flowing text (e.g., treatises and novels) or structured at different levels of physical-logical structure correspondence (e.g., letters, census lists, trade forms). Degradation may be caused by a lifetime of use and physical deterioration. In addition to the original content, access must also be preserved to user annotations and corrections, stamps and unique artwork. Each class of document requires a different approach throughout the conversion process and lends itself to different levels of information extraction and description. As the application of existing technology to the analysis of historical documents exposes a myriad of weaknesses, novel and more robust methods are being developed to cope with this challenging problem.

The input provided to an off-line handwriting recognition system is an image of a digit, a word, or more generally some text, and the system produces, as output, an ASCII transcription of the input. This task involves a number of processing steps, some of which are quite difficult. Typically, preprocessing, normalization, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing operations are required. In this article we survey the state of the art, analyze recent trends, and try to identify challenges for future research in this field."
