Given pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints between some examples, we learn a Mahalanobis distance function that captures the examples' underlying relationships well. To allow sublinear time similarity search under the learned metric, we show how to encode the learned metric parameterization into randomized locality-sensitive hash functions. We further formulate an indirect solution that enables metric learning and hashing for vector spaces whose high dimensionality makes it infeasible to learn an explicit transformation over the feature dimensions. We demonstrate the approach applied to a variety of image data sets, as well as a systems data set. The learned metrics improve accuracy relative to commonly used metric baselines, while our hashing construction enables efficient indexing with learned distances and very large databases."

However, given a query image, searching a very large image database with such measures remains impractical. We introduce a sub-linear time randomized hashing algorithm for indexing sets of feature vectors under their partial correspondences. We develop an efficient embedding function for the normalized partial matching similarity between sets, and show how to exploit random hyperplane properties to construct hash functions that satisfy locality-sensitive constraints. The result is a bounded approximate similarity search algorithm that finds (1 + epsiv)-approximate nearest neighbor images in O(N1/1+epsiv) time for a database containing N images represented by (varying numbers of) local features. We demonstrate our approach applied to image retrieval for images represented by sets of local appearance features, and show that searching over correspondences is now scalable to large image databases."

Database and query objects are embedded into a Euclidean space, in which similarities can be rapidly measured using a weighted Manhattan distance. Embedding construction is formulated as a machine learning task, where AdaBoost is used to combine many simple, ID embeddings into a multidimensional embedding that preserves a significant amount of the proximity structure in the original space. Performance is evaluated in a hand pose estimation system, and a dynamic gesture recognition system, where the proposed method is used to retrieve approximate nearest neighbors under expensive image and video similarity measures: In both systems, in quantitative experiments, BoostMap significantly increases efficiency, with minimal losses in accuracy. Moreover, the experiments indicate that BoostMap compares favorably with existing embedding methods that have been employed in computer vision and database applications, i.e., FastMap and Bourgain embeddings."

For complex and high-dimensional problems such as pose estimation, the number of required examples and the computational complexity rapidly become prohibitively high. We introduce a new algorithm that learns a set of hashing functions that efficiently index examples relevant to a particular estimation task. Our algorithm extends locality-sensitive hashing, a recently developed method to find approximate neighbors in time sublinear in the number of examples. This method depends critically on the choice of hash functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call parameter-sensitive hashing, can rapidly and accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a large database of example images."

We use patch-based feature vectors common in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions. Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions\u00bfa different parameterized function for every image of our training set\u00bfwhereas typically a single global distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome, Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered. We train and test using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark."

We suggest learning such distance functions by training binary classifiers with margins, where the classifiers are defined over the product space of pairs of images. The classifiers are trained to distinguish between pairs in which the images are from the same class and pairs, which contain images from different classes. The signed margin is used as a distance function. We explore several variants of this idea, based on using SVM and boosting algorithms as product space classifiers. Our main contribution is a distance learning method, which combines boosting hypotheses over the product space with a weak learner based on partitioning the original feature space. The weak learner used is a Gaussian mixture model computed using a constrained EM algorithm, where the constraints are equivalence constraints on pairs of data points. This approach allows us to incorporate unlabeled data into the training process. Using some benchmark databases from the UCI repository, we show that our margin based methods significantly outperform existing metric learning methods, which are based an learning a Mahalanobis distance. We then show comparative results of image retrieval in a distributed learning paradigm, using two databases: a large database of facial images (YaleB), and a database of natural images taken from a commercial CD. In both cases our GMM based boosting method outperforms all other methods, and its generalization to unseen classes is superior."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

We also show that the algorithm finds the exact near neigbhor in O(log n) time for data satisfying certain \"bounded growth\" condition.Unlike earlier schemes, our LSH scheme works directly on points in the Euclidean space without embeddings. Consequently, the resulting query time bound is free of large factors and is simple and easy to implement.

However, such descriptors are generally parameterised in very high dimensional spaces e.g. 128 dimensions in the case of SIFT. This limits the performance of feature matching techniques in terms of speed and scalability. Furthermore, these descriptors have traditionally been carefully hand crafted by manually tuning many parameters. In this paper, we tackle both of these problems by formulating descriptor design as a non- parametric dimensionality reduction problem. In contrast to previous approaches that use only the global statistics of the inputs, we adopt a discriminative approach. Starting from a large training set of labelled match/non-match pairs, we pursue lower dimensional embeddings that are optimised for their discriminative power. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that we can exceed the performance of the current state of the art techniques such as SIFT with far fewer dimensions, and with virtually no parameters to be tuned by hand."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

We formulate the problem as that of minimizing the differential relative entropy between two multivariate Gaussians under constraints on the distance function. We express this problem as a particular Bregman optimization problem---that of minimizing the LogDet divergence subject to linear constraints. Our resulting algorithm has several advantages over existing methods. First, our method can handle a wide variety of constraints and can optionally incorporate a prior on the distance function. Second, it is fast and scalable. Unlike most existing methods, no eigenvalue computations or semi-definite programming are required. We also present an online version and derive regret bounds for the resulting algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our method on a recent error reporting system for software called Clarify, in the context of metric learning for nearest neighbor classification, as well as on standard data sets."

For instance, data can often be clustered in many \"plausible\" ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider \"similar.\" For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \u211dn, learns a distance metric over \u211dn that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

We address the problem of learning metrics using side-information in the form of equivalence constraints. Unlike labels, we demonstrate that this type of side-information can sometimes be automatically obtained without the need of human intervention. We show how such side-information can be used to modify the representation of the data, leading to improved clustering and classification.Specifically, we present the Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) algorithm, which is a simple and efficient algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis metric. We show that RCA is the solution of an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If dimensionality reduction is allowed within RCA, we show that it is optimally accomplished by a version of Fisher's linear discriminant that uses constraints. Moreover, under certain Gaussian assumptions, RCA can be viewed as a Maximum Likelihood estimation of the within class covariance matrix. We conclude with extensive empirical evaluations of RCA, showing its advantage over alternative methods."

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner."

When model databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered scenes in just a few seconds."

Hand pose estimation is formulated as an image database indexing problem, where the closest matches for an input hand image are retrieved from a large database of synthetic hand images. In contrast to previous approaches, the system can function in the presence of clutter, thanks to two novel clutter-tolerant indexing methods. First, a computationally efficient approximation of the image-to-model chamfer distance is obtained by embedding binary edge images into a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Second, a general-purpose, probabilistic line matching method identifies those line segment correspondences between model and input images that are the least likely to have occurred by chance. The performance of this clutter tolerant approach is demonstrated in quantitative experiments with hundreds of real hand images."

With small images, even object recognition and segmentation is performed robustly by the visual system, despite the object being unrecognizable in isolation. Motivated by these observations, we explore the space of 32 \u00d7 32 images using a database of 10 32\u00d7 32 color images gathered from the Internet using image search engines. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 70, 399 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database represents a dense sampling of all object categories and scenes. With this dataset, we use nearest neighbor methods to perform object recognition across the 10 images."

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets."

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the one based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study."

Recent advances in computational geometry and machine learning, however, may alleviate the problems in using these methods on large data sets. This volume presents theoretical and practical discussions of nearest-neighbor (NN) methods in machine learning and examines computer vision as an application domain in which the benefit of these advanced methods is often dramatic. It brings together contributions from researchers in theory of computation, machine learning, and computer vision with the goals of bridging the gaps between disciplines and presenting state-of-the-art methods for emerging applications.The contributors focus on the importance of designing algorithms for NN search, and for the related classification, regression, and retrieval tasks, that remain efficient even as the number of points or the dimensionality of the data grows very large. The book begins with two theoretical chapters on computational geometry and then explores ways to make the NN approach practicable in machine learning applications where the dimensionality of the data and the size of the data sets make the naive methods for NN search prohibitively expensive. The final chapters describe successful applications of an NN algorithm, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to vision tasks."

Such a scheme leads to a compact representation of objects so that similarity of objects can be estimated from their compact sketches, and also leads to efficient algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search and clustering. Min-wise independent permutations provide an elegant construction of such a locality sensitive hashing scheme for a collection of subsets with the set similarity measure <i>sim</i>(<i>A,B</i>) = \\frac{|A &Pgr; B|}{|A &Pgr B|}.(MATH) We show that rounding algorithms for LPs and SDPs used in the context of approximation algorithms can be viewed as locality sensitive hashing schemes for several interesting collections of objects. Based on this insight, we construct new locality sensitive hashing schemes for:<ol><li>A collection of vectors with the distance between \u2192 \\over <i>u</i> and \u2192 \\over <i>v</i> measured by \u00d8(\u2192 \\over <i>u</i>, \u2192 \\over <i>v</i>)/\u03c0, where \u00d8(\u2192 \\over <i>u</i>, \u2192 \\over <i>v</i>) is the angle between \u2192 \\over <i>u</i>) and \u2192 \\over <i>v</i>). This yields a sketching scheme for estimating the cosine similarity measure between two vectors, as well as a simple alternative to minwise independent permutations for estimating set similarity.</li><li>A collection of distributions on <i>n</i> points in a metric space, with distance between distributions measured by the Earth Mover Distance (<b>EMD</b>), (a popular distance measure in graphics and vision).

Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images.

We find functions that embed both state and observation into a space where similarity corresponds to L1 distance, and define an observation potential based on distance in this space. This potential is extremely fast to compute and in conjunction with a grid-filtering framework can be used to reduce a continuous state estimation problem to a discrete one. We show how a state temporal prior in the grid-filter can be computed in a manner similar to a sparse HMM, resulting in real-time system performance. The resulting system is used for human pose tracking in video sequences."
