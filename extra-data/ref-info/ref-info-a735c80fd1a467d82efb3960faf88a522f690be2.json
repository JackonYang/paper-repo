This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>"

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

An illuminant direction estimation method is first used to obtain an initial estimate of camera rotation. A small number of feature points are then located based on a Gabor wavelet model for detecting local curvature discontinuities. An initial estimate of scale and translation is obtained by pairwise matching of the feature points detected from both frames. Finally, hierarchical feature matching is performed to obtain an accurate estimate of translation, rotation, and scale. The approach results in a fast method that produces excellent results. Experiments with synthetic and real images show that this algorithm yields accurate results when the scale between the image pair differs by up to 10%, the overlap between the two frames is as small as 35%, and the camera rotation between the two frames is significant.<<ETX>>"

Finding the desired set of coefficients or feature descriptors in general can be difficult, both because of the nonorthogonality of the representation and because of the high dimensionality of (say) a 512*512 image. The present approach formulates the calculation of such coefficients as an optimization problem, which a three-layered relaxation network then solves. Examples of applications which are illustrated with nonorthogonal (yet complete) 2-D 'Gabor' transforms include: (1) image compression to below 1.0 b/pixel, and (2) textural image segmentation based on the clustering of the coefficients found by the relaxation network.<<ETX>>"

These responses are generally thought to provide information about the orientation and position of lines and edges in the visual field. Some cells are also endstopped, that is selective for bars of specific lengths. Hubel and Wiesel first observed that endstopped hypercomplex cells1 could respond to curved stimuli and suggested they might be involved in detection of curvature, but the exact relationship between endstopping and curvature has never been determined. We present here a mathematical model relating endstopping to curvature in which the difference in response of two simple cells gives rise to endstopping and varies in proportion to curvature. We also provide physiological evidence that endstopped cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex are selective for curvature, whereas non-endstopped cells are not, and that some are selective for the sign of curvature. The prevailing view of edge and curve determination is that orientations are selected locally by the class of simple cortical cells3 and then integrated to form global curves. We have developed a computational theory of orientation selection4,5 which shows that measurements of orientation obtained by simple cells are not sufficient because there will be strong, incorrect responses from cells whose receptive fields (RFs) span distinct curves (Fig. 1). If estimates of curvature are available, however, these inappropriate responses can be eliminated. Curvature provides the key to structuring the network that underlies our theory and distinguishes it from previous lateral inhibition schemes6,7."

                "text": "We have studied the mechanism of contour perception by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of alert rhesus monkeys. In order to assess the relationship between neural signals and perception, we compared the responses to edges and lines with the responses to patterns in which human observers perceive a contour where no line or edge is given (anomalous contour), such as the border between gratings of thin lines offset by half a cycle. With only one exception out of 60, orientation-selective neurons in area V1 did not signal the anomalous contour. Many neurons failed to respond to this stimulus at all, others responded according to the orientation of the grating lines. In area V2, 45 of 103 neurons (44%) signaled the orientation of the anomalous contour. Sixteen did so without signaling the orientation of the inducing lines. Some responded better to anomalous contours than to the optimum bars or edges. Preferred orientations and widths of tuning for anomalous contour and bar or edge were found to be highly correlated, but not identical, in each neuron. Similar to perception, the neuronal responses depended on a minimum number of lines inducing the contour, but not so much on line spacing, and tended to be weaker when the lines were oblique rather than orthogonal to the border. With oblique lines, the orientations signaled were biased towards the orientation orthogonal to the lines, as in the Zollner illusion. We conclude that contours may be defined first at the level of V2. While the unresponsiveness of neurons in V1 to this type of anomalous contour is in agreement with linear filter predictions, the responses of V2 neurons need to be explained. We assume that they sum the signals of 2 parallel paths, one that defines edges and lines and another that defines anomalous contours by pooling signals from end-stopped receptive fields oriented mainly orthogonal to the contour."

The model consists of a hierarchical system which extracts and groups salient features in the image at different spatial scales. In the first stage a Gabor wavelet decomposition provides a representation of the image which is orientation selective, has optimal localization properties, and provides a good model for early feature detection. Following this, local competitive interactions are introduced which help in reducing the effects of noise and illumination variations. Scale interactions help in localizing line ends and corners, and play an important role in boundary perception. The final stage groups similar features aiding in boundary completion. Experimental results on detecting edges, texture boundaries, and illusory contours are provided.<<ETX>>"
