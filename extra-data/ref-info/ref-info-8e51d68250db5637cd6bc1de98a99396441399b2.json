We introduce a notion of locally optimal transport plan, motivated by the weak KAM (Aubry-Mather) theory, and show that all locally optimal transport plans are conjugate to shifts and that the cost of a locally optimal transport plan is a convex function of a shift parameter. This theory is applied to a transportation problem arising in image processing: for two sets of point masses on the circle, both of which have the same total mass, find an optimal transport plan with respect to a given cost function satisfying the Monge condition. In the circular case the sorting strategy fails to provide a unique candidate solution and a naive approach requires a quadratic number of operations. For the case of $N$ real-valued point masses we present an O(N |log epsilon|) algorithm that approximates the optimal cost within epsilon; when all masses are integer multiples of 1/M, the algorithm gives an exact solution in O(N log M) operations."

                "text": "The Monge-Kantorovich problem is to move one distribution of mass onto another as efficiently as possible, where Monge's original criterion for efficiency [19] was to minimize the average distance transported. Subsequently studied by many authors, it was not until 1976 that Sudakov showed solutions to be realized in the original sense of Monge, i.e., as mappings from Rn to Rn [23]. A second proof of this existence result formed the subject of a recent monograph by Evans and Gangbo [7], who avoided Sudakov's measure decomposition results by using a partial differential equations approach. In the present manuscript, we give a third existence proof for optimal mappings, which has some advantages (and disadvantages) relative to existing approaches: it requires no continuity or separation of the mass distributions, yet our explicit construction yields more geometrical control than the abstract method of Sudakov. (Indeed, this control turns out to be essential for addressing a gap which has recently surfaced in Sudakov's approach to the problem in dimensions n > 3; see the remarks at the end of this section.) It is also shorter and more flexible than either, and can be adapted to handle transportation on Riemannian manifolds or around obstacles, as we plan to show in a subsequent work [13]. The problem considered here is the classical one: Problem 1 (Monge). Fix a norm d(x, y) = llx-yll on Rn, and two densities -non-negative Borel functions f+, fE Ll (Rn) satisfying the mass balance condition"

                "text": "Optimal transport (OT) defines a powerful framework to compare probability distributions in a geometrically faithful way. However, the practical impact of OT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class of stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems routinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able to manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply requiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in high-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize these densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output the correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two main ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an expectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a smooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms that have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three different setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we show that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's algorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when comparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete reformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient descent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem by discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we propose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apart from computing OT on finite samples. We backup these claims on a set of discrete, semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems."

This question is shown to be equivalent to a double obstacle problem for the Monge-Ampere equation, for which sucient conditions are given to guarantee uniqueness of the solution, such as f vanishing on sptg in the quadratic case. The part of f to be transported increases monotonically with m, and if sptf and sptg are separated by a hyperplane H, then this part will separated from the balance of f by a semiconcave Lipschitz graph over the hyperplane. If f = f and g = g are bounded away from zero and infinity on separated strictly convex domains , R n , for the quadratic cost this graph is shown to be a C 1, loc hypersurface in whose normal coincides with the direction transported; the optimal map between f and g is shown to be Holder continuous up to this free bound- ary, and to those parts of the fixed boundary @ which map to locally convex parts of the path-connected target region."

We unify the two main approaches to optimal transport, namely Monge-Kantorovitch and Sinkhorn-Cuturi, into what we define as Tsallis regularized optimal transport (TROT). TROT interpolates a rich family of distortions from Wasserstein to Kullback-Leibler, encompassing as well Pearson, Neyman and Hellinger divergences, to name a few. We show that metric properties known for Sinkhorn-Cuturi generalize to TROT, and provide efficient algorithms for finding the optimal transportation plan with formal convergence proofs. We also present the first application of optimal transport to the problem of ecological inference, that is, the reconstruction of joint distributions from their marginals, a problem of large interest in the social sciences. TROT provides a convenient framework for ecological inference by allowing to compute the joint distribution -\u2014 that is, the optimal transportation plan itself \u2014 when side information is available, which is e.g. typically what census represents in political science. Experiments on data from the 2012 US presidential elections display the potential of TROT in delivering a faithful reconstruction of the joint distribution of ethnic groups and voter preferences.\n \n"

We refer to this setting as semi-discrete optimal transport. Among the several algorithms proposed to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems, one currently needs to choose between algorithms that are slow but come with a convergence speed analysis (e.g. Oliker-Prussner) or algorithms that are much faster in practice but which come with no convergence guarantees Algorithms of the first kind rely on coordinate-wise increments and the number of iterations required to reach the solution up to an error of $\\epsilon$ is of order $N^3/\\epsilon$, where $N$ is the number of Dirac masses in the target measure. On the other hand, algorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the semi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization problem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method. \nThe purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between theory and practice by introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient and by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The main assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears in the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang condition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a quantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincar\\'e-Wirtinger inequality)."

Despite several appealing properties, incorporating PDs in learning pipelines can be challenging because their natural geometry is not Hilbertian. Indeed, this was recently exemplified in a string of papers which show that the simple task of averaging a few PDs can be computationally prohibitive. We propose in this article a tractable framework to carry out standard tasks on PDs at scale, notably evaluating distances, estimating barycenters and performing clustering. This framework builds upon a reformulation of PD metrics as optimal transport (OT) problems. Doing so, we can exploit recent computational advances: the OT problem on a planar grid, when regularized with entropy, is convex can be solved in linear time using the Sinkhorn algorithm and convolutions. This results in scalable computations that can stream on GPUs. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by carrying out clustering with diagrams metrics on several thousands of PDs, a scale never seen before in the literature."

                "text": "This article presents a new class of \"optimal transportation\"-like distances between arbitrary positive Radon measures. These distances are defined by two equivalent alternative formulations: (i) a \"fluid dynamic\" formulation defining the distance as a geodesic distance over the space of measures (ii) a static \"Kantorovich\" formulation where the distance is the minimum of an optimization program over pairs of couplings describing the transfer (transport, creation and destruction) of mass between two measures. Both formulations are convex optimization problems, and the ability to switch from one to the other depending on the targeted application is a crucial property of our models. Of particular interest is the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric recently introduced independently by [CSPV15,KMV15]. Defined initially through a dynamic formulation, it belongs to this class of metrics and hence automatically benefits from a static Kantorovich formulation. Switching from the initial Eulerian expression of this metric to a Lagrangian point of view provides the generalization of Otto's Riemannian submersion to this new setting, where the group of diffeomorphisms is replaced by a semi-direct product of group. This Riemannian submersion enables a formal computation of the sectional curvature of the space of densities and the formulation of an equivalent Monge problem."

Our aim is to highlight new connections between the two that are richer and deeper than those previously described in the literature. We begin with an elementary derivation of the Benamou\u2013Brenier fluid dynamic version of the optimal transport problem and provide, in parallel, a new fluid dynamic version of the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem. We observe that the latter establishes an important connection with optimal transport without zero-noise limits and solves a question posed by Eric Carlen in 2006. Indeed, the two variational problems differ by a Fisher information functional. We motivate and consider a generalization of optimal mass transport in the form of a (fluid dynamic) problem of optimal transport with prior. This can be seen as the zero-noise limit of Schr\u00f6dinger bridges when the prior is any Markovian evolution. We finally specialize to the Gaussian case and derive an explicit computational theory based on matrix Riccati differential equations. A numerical example involving Brownian particles is also provided."

                "text": "This paper introduces a numerical algorithm to compute the L2 optimal transport map between two measures \u00b5 and \u03bd, where \u00b5 derives from a density \u03c1 defined as a piecewise linear function (supported by a tetrahedral mesh), and where \u03bd is a sum of Dirac masses. I first give an elementary presentation of some known results on optimal transport and then observe a relation with another problem (optimal sampling). This relation gives simple arguments to study the objective functions that characterize both problems. I then propose a practical algorithm to compute the optimal transport map between a piecewise linear density and a sum of Dirac masses in 3D. In this semi-discrete setting, Aurenhammer et.al [8th Symposium on Computational Geometry conf. proc., ACM (1992)] showed that the optimal transport map is determined by the weights of a power diagram. The optimal weights are computed by minimizing a convex objective function with a quasi-Newton method. To evaluate the value and gradient of this objective function, I propose an efficient and robust algorithm, that computes at each iteration the intersection between a power diagram and the tetrahedral mesh that defines the measure \u00b5. The numerical algorithm is experimented and evaluated on several datasets, with up to hundred thousands tetrahedra and one million Dirac masses. Resume. Cet article decrit un algorithme numerique pour calculer l'application de transport optimal L2 entre deux mesures \u00b5 et \u03bd, o` u \u00b5 derive d'une densite \u03c1 lineaire par morceaux (supportee par un maillage tetraedrique), et o` u \u03bd est une somme de masses de Dirac. Je donne tout d'abord une presentation elementaire de quelques resultats connus sur le transport optimal , et observe ensuite une relation avec un autreprobi eme (l'\u00b4 echantillonage optimal). Cette relation fournit des arguments simples pour etudier les fonctions objectifs caracterisant les deuxprobi emes. Je propose ensuite un algorithme pratique pour calculer le transport optimal entre une densite lineaire par morceaux et une somme de masses de Dirac en 3D. Dans ce cas semi-discret, Auren-hammer et.al [8th Symposium on Computational Geometry conf. proc., ACM (1992)] ont montre que l'application de transport optimal est determinee par les poids d'un diagramme de puissance. Les poids optimaux sont calcules en minimisant une fonction objectif convexe a l'aide d'une methode quasi-Newton. Pour evaluer cette fonction objectif et son gradient, je propose un algorithme efficace et robuste, qui calcule a chaque iteration l'intersection entre un diagramme de puissance et le maillage tetrahedrique qui definit la mesure \u00b5. L'algorithme numerique est experimente et evalue sur plusieurs jeux de donnees , comportant jusqu'` a plusieurs centaines de milliers detetra edres et un million de masses de Dirac."

The general idea is to introduce an entropic regularization of the initial linear program. This regularized problem corresponds to a Kullback-Leibler Bregman di-vergence projection of a vector (representing some initial joint distribu-tion) on the polytope of constraints. We show that for many problems related to optimal transport, the set of linear constraints can be split in an intersection of a few simple constraints, for which the projections can be computed in closed form. This allows us to make use of iterative Bregman projections (when there are only equality constraints) or more generally Bregman-Dykstra iterations (when inequality constraints are in-volved). We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to several variational problems related to optimal transport: barycenters for the optimal trans-port metric, tomographic reconstruction, multi-marginal optimal trans-port and in particular its application to Brenier's relaxed solutions of in-compressible Euler equations, partial un-balanced optimal transport and optimal transport with capacity constraints."

In the special case of the optimal transport problem, this technique dates back to the early work of Schr\\\"odinger. This approach has recently been used successfully to solve optimal transport related problems in several applied fields such as imaging sciences, machine learning and social sciences. The main reason for this success is that, in contrast to linear programming solvers, the resulting algorithms are highly parallelizable and take advantage of the geometry of the computational grid (e.g. an image or a triangulated mesh). The first contribution of this article is the proof of the $\\Gamma$-convergence of the entropic regularized optimal transport problem towards the Monge-Kantorovich problem for the squared Euclidean norm cost function. This implies in particular the convergence of the optimal entropic regularized transport plan towards an optimal transport plan as the entropy vanishes. Optimal transport distances are also useful to define gradient flows as a limit of implicit Euler steps according to the transportation distance. Our second contribution is a proof that implicit steps according to the entropic regularized distance converge towards the original gradient flow when both the step size and the entropic penalty vanish (in some controlled way)."

We propose in this work a new family of optimal transport distances that look at transport problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classic optimal transport problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transport solvers. We also show that this regularized distance improves upon classic optimal transport distances on the MNIST classification problem."

In this context, the regularized optimal transport turns out to be equivalent to a matrix nearness problem with respect to Bregman divergences. Our framework thus naturally generalizes a previously proposed regularization based on the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and solved with the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. We call the regularized optimal transport distance the rot mover's distance in reference to the classical earth mover's distance. We develop two generic schemes that we respectively call the alternate scaling algorithm and the non-negative alternate scaling algorithm, to compute efficiently the regularized optimal plans depending on whether the domain of the regularizer lies within the non-negative orthant or not. These schemes are based on Dykstra's algorithm with alternate Bregman projections, and further exploit the Newton-Raphson method when applied to separable divergences. We enhance the separable case with a sparse extension to deal with high data dimensions. We also instantiate our proposed framework and discuss the inherent specificities for well-known regularizers and statistical divergences in the machine learning and information geometry communities. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our methods with experiments using synthetic data to illustrate the effect of different regularizers and penalties on the solutions, as well as real-world data for a pattern recognition application to audio scene classification."

Yet, the incompressibility constraint prevents this velocity field to be realized and the actual velocity is the projection of the desired one onto the set of admissible velocities. Instead of looking at a microscopic setting (where individuals are represented by rigid discs), here the macroscopic approach is investigated, where the unknwon is the evolution of the density . If a gradient structure is given, say U is the opposite of the gradient of D where D is, for instance, the distance to the exit door, the problem is presented as a Gradient Flow in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. The functional which gives the Gradient Flow is neither finitely valued (since it takes into account the constraints on the density), nor geodesically convex, which requires for an ad-hoc study of the convergence of a discrete scheme."

It can be seen as an inf-convolution of the well-known Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance and the Hellinger-Kakutani distance. The new distance is based on a dynamical formulation given by an Onsager operator that is the sum of a Wasserstein diffusion part and an additional reaction part describing the generation and absorption of mass. We present a full characterization of the distance and some of its properties. In particular, the distance can be equivalently described by an optimal transport problem on the cone space over the underlying space $\\Omega$. We give a construction of geodesic curves and discuss examples and their general properties."

Indeed, whereas this problem can be solved linearly when the cost is a convex function of the distance on the line (or more generally when the cost matrix between points is a Monge matrix), to the best of our knowledge no simple solution has been proposed for concave costs, which are more realistic in many applications, especially in economic situations. The problem we consider may be unbalanced, in the sense that the weight of all the supplies might be larger than the weight of all the demands. We show how to use the local indicators hierarchically to solve the transportation problem for concave costs on the line."

We prove that the MOT value can be approximated using linear programming (LP) problems which result from a discretisation of the marginal distributions combined with a suitable relaxation of the martingale constraint. Specialising to dimension one, we provide bounds on the convergence rate of the above scheme. We also show a stability result under only partial specification of the marginal distributions. Finally, we specialise to a particular discretisation scheme which preserves the convex ordering and does not require the martingale relaxation. We introduce an entropic regularisation for the corresponding LP problem and detail the corresponding iterative Bregman projection. We also rewrite its dual problem as a minimisation problem without constraint and solve it by computing the concave envelope of scattered data."

First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a \\textit{Monge map} as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT plan and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling."

On a graph, transportation problems can be used to express challenging tasks involving matching supply to demand with minimal shipment expense; in discrete language, these become minimum-cost network flow problems. Regularization typically is needed to ensure uniqueness for the linear ground distance case and to improve optimization convergence; state-of-the-art techniques employ entropic regularization on the transportation matrix. In this paper, we explore a quadratic alternative to entropic regularization for transport over a graph. We theoretically analyze the behavior of quadratically-regularized graph transport, characterizing how regularization affects the structure of flows in the regime of small but nonzero regularization. We further exploit elegant second-order structure in the dual of this problem to derive an easily-implemented Newton-type optimization algorithm."

The transportation problem (TP) is a classic problem in operations research. The problem was posed for the first time by Hitchcock in 1941 [8] and independently by Koopmans in 1947 [11]. The problem appears in any standard introductory course on operations research. The m \u00d7 n TP has m supply points and n demand points. Each supply point i holds ri units, and each demand point j wants cj units. A solution to the problem can be written as a m\u00d7n matrix X with entries decision variables xij having value equal to the number of units transported from supply point i to demand point j. Without loss of generality we assume that \u2211m i=1 ri = \u2211n j=1 cj . The objective is to minimize total transportation costs \u2211m i=1 \u2211n j=1 tijxij , where tij is the unit transportation cost from supply point i to demand point j.

                "text": "Wasserstein barycenters correspond to optimal solutions of transportation problems for several marginals, and as such have a wide range of applications ranging from economics to statistics and computer science. When the marginal probability measures are absolutely continuous (or vanish on small sets) the theory of Wasserstein barycenters is well-developed [see the seminal paper (Agueh and Carlier in SIAM J Math Anal 43(2):904\u2013924, 2011)]. However, exact continuous computation of Wasserstein barycenters in this setting is tractable in only a small number of specialized cases. Moreover, in many applications data is given as a set of probability measures with finite support. In this paper, we develop theoretical results for Wasserstein barycenters in this discrete setting. Our results rely heavily on polyhedral theory which is possible due to the discrete structure of the marginals. The results closely mirror those in the continuous case with a few exceptions. In this discrete setting we establish that Wasserstein barycenters must also be discrete measures and there is always a barycenter which is provably sparse. Moreover, for each Wasserstein barycenter there exists a non-mass-splitting optimal transport to each of the discrete marginals. Such non-mass-splitting transports do not generally exist between two discrete measures unless special mass balance conditions hold. This makes Wasserstein barycenters in this discrete setting special in this regard. We illustrate the results of our discrete barycenter theory with a proof-of-concept computation for a hypothetical transportation problem with multiple marginals: distributing a fixed set of goods when the demand can take on different distributional shapes characterized by the discrete marginal distributions. A Wasserstein barycenter, in this case, represents an optimal distribution of inventory facilities which minimize the squared distance/transportation cost totaled over all demands."

This approach involves the logarithmic mean of measure densities on adjacent nodes of the graph. For this model a variational time discretization of the probability densities on graph nodes and the momenta on graph edges is proposed. A robust descent algorithm for the action functional is derived, which in particular uses a proximal splitting with an edgewise nonlinear projection on the convex subgraph of the logarithmic mean. Thereby, suitable chosen slack variables avoid a global coupling of probability densities on all graph nodes in the projection step. For the time discrete action functional $$\\Gamma $$ \u0393 -convergence to the time continuous action is established. Numerical results for a selection of test cases show qualitative and quantitative properties of the optimal transport on graphs. Finally, we use our algorithm to implement a JKO scheme for the gradient flow of the entropy in discrete transportation distance, which is known to coincide with underlying Markov semigroup, and test our results against a classical backward Euler discretization of this discrete heat flow."

They are modeled on the dynamical characterization of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein-Wasserstein distances proposed by Benamou and Brenier (Numer Math 84:375\u2013393, 2000) and provide a wide family interpolating between the Wasserstein and the homogeneous $${W^{-1,p}_\\gamma}$$ -Sobolev distances. From the point of view of optimal transport theory, these distances minimize a dynamical cost to move a given initial distribution of mass to a final configuration. An important difference with the classical setting in mass transport theory is that the cost not only depends on the velocity of the moving particles but also on the densities of the intermediate configurations with respect to a given reference measure \u03b3. We study the topological and geometric properties of these new distances, comparing them with the notion of weak convergence of measures and the well established Kantorovich-Rubinstein-Wasserstein theory. An example of possible applications to the geometric theory of gradient flows is also given."

This result relies on a new analysis of Sinkhorn iteration, which also directly suggests a new greedy coordinate descent algorithm, Greenkhorn, with the same theoretical guarantees.

While classical optimal transport considers only normalized probability distributions, it is important for many applications to be able to compute some sort of re-laxed transportation between arbitrary positive measures. A generic class of such \u201cunbalanced\u201d optimal transport problems has been recently proposed by several authors. In this paper, we show how to extend the, now classical, entropic regularization scheme to these unbalanced problems. This gives rise to fast, highly parallelizable algorithms that operate by performing only diagonal scaling (i.e. pointwise multiplications) of the transportation couplings. They are generalizations of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm. We show how these methods can be used to solve unbalanced transport, unbalanced gradient flows, and to compute unbalanced barycenters. We showcase applications to 2-D shape modification, color transfer, and growth models."

For a pair of given input images geodesic paths in the space of images are defined as minimizers of a resulting path energy. To this end, the underlying Riemannian metric measures the rate of transport cost and the rate of viscous dissipation. Furthermore, the model is capable to deal with strongly varying image contrast and explicitly allows for sources and sinks in the transport equations which are incorporated in the metric related to the metamorphosis approach by Trouv\\'e and Younes. In the non-viscous case with source term existence of geodesic paths is proven in the space of measures. The proposed model is explored on the range from merely optimal transport to strongly dissipative dynamics. For this model a robust and effective variational time discretization of geodesic paths is proposed. This requires to minimize a discrete path energy consisting of a sum of consecutive image matching functionals. These functionals are defined on corresponding pairs of intensity functions and on associated pairwise matching deformations. Existence of time discrete geodesics is demonstrated. Furthermore, a finite element implementation is proposed and applied to instructive test cases and to real images. In the non-viscous case this is compared to the algorithm proposed by Benamou and Brenier including a discretization of the source term. Finally, the model is generalized to define discrete weighted barycentres with applications to textures and objects."

For many applications of dynamic trees, values must be combined along paths. For other applications, values must be combined over entire trees. For the latter situation, an idea used originally in parallel graph algorithms, to represent trees by Euler tours, leads to a simple implementation with a time of O(logn) per tree operation, wheren is the number of tree vertices.

This new \u2018trimmed k-barycenters\u2019 approach relies on recent results on barycenters in Wasserstein space that allow intensive computation, as required by clustering algorithms to be feasible. The possibility of trimming the most discrepant distributions results in a gain in stability and robustness, highly convenient in this setting. As a remarkable application, we consider a parallelized clustering setup in which each of m units processes a portion of the data, producing a clustering report, encoded as k probabilities. We prove that the trimmed k-barycenter of the $$m\\times k$$m\u00d7k reports produces a consistent aggregation which we consider the result of a \u2018wide consensus\u2019. We also prove that a weighted version of trimmed k-means algorithms based on k-barycenters in the space of Wasserstein keeps the descending character of the concentration step, guaranteeing convergence to local minima. We illustrate the methodology with simulated and real data examples. These include clustering populations by age distributions and analysis of cytometric data."

Then comes an independent exposition of the Wasserstein theory, with a short introduction to the optimal transport tools that are needed and to the notion of geodesic convexity, followed by a precise description of the Jordan\u2013Kinderlehrer\u2013Otto scheme and a sketch of proof to obtain its convergence in the easiest cases. A discussion of which equations are gradient flows PDEs and of numerical methods based on these ideas is also provided. The paper ends with a new, theoretical, development, due to Ambrosio, Gigli, Savar\u00e9, Kuwada and Ohta: the study of the heat flow in metric measure spaces."

This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the definition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem."

The mass is transported along a continuous semimartingale, and the cost of transportation depends on the drift and the diffusion coefficients of the continuous semimartingale. The optimal transportation problem minimizes the cost among all continuous semimartingales with given initial and terminal distributions. Our first main result is an extension of the Kantorovitch duality to this context. We also suggest a finite-difference scheme combined with the gradient projection algorithm to approximate the dual value. We prove the convergence of the scheme, and we derive a rate of convergence. We finally provide an application in the context of financial mathematics, which originally motivated our extension of the Monge-Kantorovitch problem. Namely, we implement our scheme to approximate no-arbitrage bounds on the prices of exotic options given the implied volatility curve of some maturity."

Jamison proved that the new law is obtained through a multiplicative functional transformation of the prior. This transformation is characterised by an automorphism on the space of endpoints probability measures, which has been studied by Fortet, Beurling, and others. A similar question can be raised for processes evolving in a discrete time and space as well as for processes defined over non-commutative probability spaces. The present paper builds on earlier work by Pavon and Ticozzi and begins by establishing solutions to Schrodinger systems for Markov chains. Our approach is based on the Hilbert metric and shows that the solution to the Schrodinger bridge is provided by the fixed point of a contractive map. We approach, in a similar manner, the steering of ..."

Simple norms and divergences such as the total variation and the relative entropy only compare densities in a point-wise manner and fail to capture the geometric nature of the problem. In sharp contrast, Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) and Optimal Transport distances (OT) are two classes of distances between measures that take into account the geometry of the underlying space and metrize the convergence in law.\n\nThis paper studies the Sinkhorn divergences, a family of geometric divergences that interpolates between MMD and OT. Relying on a new notion of geometric entropy, we provide theoretical guarantees for these divergences: positivity, convexity and metrization of the convergence in law. On the practical side, we detail a numerical scheme that enables the large scale application of these divergences for machine learning: on the GPU, gradients of the Sinkhorn loss can be computed for batches of a million samples."

All the methods in the class use the notion of\u03b5-complementary slackness, and most do not explicitly manipulate any \u201cglobal\u201d objects such as paths, trees, or cuts. Interestingly, these methods have stimulated a large number of newserial computational complexity results. We develop the basic theory of these methods and present two specific methods, the\u03b5-relaxation algorithm for the minimum-cost flow problem, and theauction algorithm for the assignment problem. We show how to implement these methods with serial complexities of O(N3 logNC) and O(NA logNC), respectively. We also discuss practical implementation issues and computational experience to date. Finally, we show how to implement\u03b5-relaxation in a completely asynchronous, \u201cchaotic\u201d environment in which some processors compute faster than others, some processors communicate faster than others, and there can be arbitrarily large communication delays."

When the cost is given by the square of the Euclidean distance, one can define a metric on densities called the Wasserstein distance. In this note, we formulate a natural matrix counterpart of the MK problem for positive-definite density matrices. We prove a number of results about this metric including showing that it can be formulated as a convex optimisation problem, strong duality, an analogue of the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Wirtinger inequality and a Lax\u2013Hopf\u2013Oleinik\u2013type result."

                "text": "We present a generalized optimal transport model in which the mass-preserving constraint for the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance is relaxed by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. The source term is also incorporated in the path energy by means of its squared $L^2$-norm in time of a functional with linear growth in space. This extension of the original transport model enables local density modulation, which is a desirable feature in applications such as image warping and blending. A key advantage of the use of a functional with linear growth in space is that it allows for singular sources and sinks, which can be supported on points or lines. On a technical level, the $L^2$-norm in time ensures a disintegration of the source in time, which we use to obtain the well-posedness of the model and the existence of geodesic paths. Furthermore, a numerical scheme based on the proximal splitting approach (Papadakis et al., 2014) is presented. We compare our model with the corresponding model involving the $L^2(L^2)$-norm of the source, which merges the metamorphosis approach and the optimal transport approaches in imaging. Selected numerical test cases show strikingly different behaviour."

Objects are viewed as metric measure spaces, and based on ideas from mass transportation, a Gromov\u2013Wasserstein type of distance between objects is defined. This reformulation yields a distance between objects which is more amenable to practical computations but retains all the desirable theoretical underpinnings. The theoretical properties of this new notion of distance are studied, and it is established that it provides a strict metric on the collection of isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces. Furthermore, the topology generated by this metric is studied, and sufficient conditions for the pre-compactness of families of metric measure spaces are identified. A\u00a0second goal of this paper is to establish links to several other practical methods proposed in the literature for comparing/matching shapes in precise terms. This is done by proving explicit lower bounds for the proposed distance that involve many of the invariants previously reported by researchers. These lower bounds can be computed in polynomial time. The numerical implementations of the ideas are discussed and computational examples are presented."

Solu- tions can be considered as geodesic curves along the manifold of volume pre- serving mappings. Here the \"shortest path problem\" is investigated. Given two different volume preserving mappings at two different times, find, for the inter- mediate times, an incompressible flow map that minimizes the kinetic energy (or, more generally, the Action). In its classical formulation, this problem has been solved [7] only when the two different mappings are sufficiently close in some very strong sense. In this paper, a new framework is introduced, where gen- eralized flows are defined, in the spirit of L. C. Young, as probability measures on the set of all possible trajectories in the physical space. Then the minimiza- tion problem is generalized as the \"continuous linear programming\" problem that is much easier to handle.

This paper provides a fast approach to apply the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) (a.k.a optimal transport, Wasserstein distance) for super- vised and unsupervised image segmentation. The model globally incorporates the transportation costs (original Monge-Kantorovich type) among histograms of multiple dimensional features, e.g. gray intensity and texture in image\u2019s foreground and background. The computational complexity is often high for the EMD between two histograms on Euclidean spaces with dimensions larger than one. We overcome this computational di\ufb03culty by rewriting the model into a L 1 type minimization with the linear dimension of feature space. We then apply a fast algorithm based on the primal-dual method. Compare to several state-of-the-art EMD models, the experimental results based on image data sets demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance in terms of the accuracy and the stability of the image segmentation."

In particular, we explore the applicability of diffusion distances within the Gromov-Hausdorff framework. While the traditionally used geodesic distance exploits the shortest path between points on the surface, the diffusion distance averages all paths connecting the points. The diffusion distance constitutes an intrinsic metric which is robust, in particular, to topological changes. Such changes in the form of shortcuts, holes, and missing data may be a result of natural non-rigid deformations as well as acquisition and representation noise due to inaccurate surface construction. The presentation of the proposed framework is complemented with examples demonstrating that in addition to the relatively low complexity involved in the computation of the diffusion distances between surface points, its recognition and matching performances favorably compare to the classical geodesic distances in the presence of topological changes between the non-rigid shapes."

These flows have proved useful to tackle theoretically and numerically non-linear diffusion equations that model for instance porous media or crowd evolutions. These gradient flows define a suitable notion of weak solutions for these evolutions and they can be approximated in a stable way using discrete flows. These discrete flows are implicit Euler time stepping according to the Wasserstein metric. A bottleneck of these approaches is the high computational load induced by the resolution of each step. Indeed, this corresponds to the resolution of a convex optimization problem involving a Wasserstein distance to the previous iterate. Following several recent works on the approximation of Wasserstein distances, we consider a discrete flow induced by an entropic regularization of the transportation coupling. This entropic regularization allows one to trade the initial Wasserstein fidelity term for a Kulback-Leibler divergence, which is easier to deal with numerically. We show how KL proximal schemes, and in particular Dykstra's algorithm, can be used to compute each step of the regularized flow. The resulting algorithm is both fast, parallelizable and versatile, because it only requires multiplications by a Gibbs kernel. On Euclidean domains discretized on an uniform grid, this corresponds to a linear filtering (for instance a Gaussian filtering when $c$ is the squared Euclidean distance) which can be computed in nearly linear time. On more general domains, such as (possibly non-convex) shapes or on manifolds discretized by a triangular mesh, following a recently proposed numerical scheme for optimal transport, this Gibbs kernel multiplication is approximated by a short-time heat diffusion."

In this paper we present a method for computing elastic registration and warping maps based on the Monge\u2013Kantorovich theory of optimal mass transport. This mass transport method has a number of important characteristics. First, it is parameter free. Moreover, it utilizes all of the grayscale data in both images, places the two images on equal footing and is symmetrical: the optimal mapping from image A to image B being the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A. The method does not require that landmarks be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique; there are no other local minimizers. Finally, optimal transport naturally takes into account changes in density that result from changes in area or volume. Although the optimal transport method is certainly not appropriate for all registration and warping problems, this mass preservation property makes the Monge\u2013Kantorovich approach quite useful for an interesting class of warping problems, as we show in this paper. Our method for finding the registration mapping is based on a partial differential equation approach to the minimization of the L2 Kantorovich\u2013Wasserstein or \u201cEarth Mover's Distance\u201d under a mass preservation constraint. We show how this approach leads to practical algorithms, and demonstrate our method with a number of examples, including those from the medical field. We also extend this method to take into account changes in intensity, and show that it is well suited for applications such as image morphing."

                "text": "Optimal Transport Methods in Economics is the first textbook on the subject written especially for students and researchers in economics. Optimal transport theory is used widely to solve problems in mathematics and some areas of the sciences, but it can also be used to understand a range of problems in applied economics, such as the matching between job seekers and jobs, the determinants of real estate prices, and the formation of matrimonial unions. This is the first text to develop clear applications of optimal transport to economic modeling, statistics, and econometrics. It covers the basic results of the theory as well as their relations to linear programming, network flow problems, convex analysis, and computational geometry. Emphasizing computational methods, it also includes programming examples that provide details on implementation. Applications include discrete choice models, models of differential demand, and quantile-based statistical estimation methods, as well as asset pricing models. Authoritative and accessible, Optimal Transport Methods in Economics also features numerous exercises throughout that help you develop your mathematical agility, deepen your computational skills, and strengthen your economic intuition."

We show that in the case of two electrons and in the semiclassical limit, the exact exchange\u2010correlation functional reduces to a very interesting functional that depends on an optimal transport map T associated with a given density \u03c1. The limit problem has been suggested, on grounds of formal arguments, in the physics literature, but it appears that it has not hitherto been interpreted as an optimal transport problem. Since the above limit is strongly correlated, the limit functional yields insight into electron correlations. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such an optimal map for any number of electrons and each \u03c1 and determine the map explicitly in the case when \u03c1 is radially symmetric. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms."

It leverages the theory of optimal transport, and in particular the definition of Wasserstein barycenters, to introduce for the first time the notion of barycentric coordinates for histograms. These coordinates take into account the underlying geometry of the ground space on which the histograms are defined, and are thus particularly meaningful for applications in graphics to shapes, color or material modification. Beside this abstract construction, we propose a fast numerical optimization scheme to solve this backward problem (finding the barycentric coordinates of a given histogram) with a low computational overhead with respect to the forward problem (computing the barycenter). This scheme relies on a backward algorithmic differentiation of the Sinkhorn algorithm which is used to optimize the entropic regularization of Wasserstein barycenters. We showcase an illustrative set of applications of these Wasserstein coordinates to various problems in computer graphics: shape approximation, BRDF acquisition and color editing."

Efficient methods that stably extract \"soft\" matches in the presence of diverse geometric structures have proven to be valuable for shape retrieval and transfer of labels or semantic information. With these applications in mind, we present an algorithm for probabilistic correspondence that optimizes an entropy-regularized Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) objective. Built upon recent developments in numerical optimal transportation, our algorithm is compact, provably convergent, and applicable to any geometric domain expressible as a metric measure matrix. We provide comprehensive experiments illustrating the convergence and applicability of our algorithm to a variety of graphics tasks. Furthermore, we expand entropic GW correspondence to a framework for other matching problems, incorporating partial distance matrices, user guidance, shape exploration, symmetry detection, and joint analysis of more than two domains. These applications expand the scope of entropic GW correspondence to major shape analysis problems and are stable to distortion and noise."

These matrices, which define the interrelationships between points sampled from individual domains, are not required to have the same size or to be in row-by-row correspondence. We compare these matrices using the softassign criterion, which measures the minimum distortion induced by a probabilistic map from the rows of one similarity matrix to the rows of another; this criterion amounts to a regularized version of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between metric-measure spaces. The barycenter is then defined as a Frechet mean of the input matrices with respect to this criterion, minimizing a weighted sum of softassign values. We provide a fast iterative algorithm for the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, built upon state-of-the-art tools for regularized optimal transportation. We demonstrate its application to the computation of shape barycenters and to the prediction of energy levels from molecular configurations in quantum chemistry."

The (partial) answers to these questions uncover a surprising divergence from the classical two marginal setting, and reflect a delicate dependence on the cost function.

Its structure is similar to that of a graduate course. A graduate course usually begins with a course description, and so do we. Course description. The objective of this book is twofold. First of all, we wanted to give a detailed exposition of basic notions and techniques in the theory of length spaces, a theory which experienced a very fast development in the past few decades and penetrated into many other mathematical disciplines (such as Group Theory, Dynamical Systems, and Partial Differential Equations). However, we have a wider goal of giving an elementary introduction into a broad variety of the most geometrical topics in geometry\u2014the ones related to the notion of distance. This is the reason why we included metric introductions to Riemannian and hyperbolic geometries. This book tends to work with \" easy-to-touch \" mathematical objects by means of \" easy-to-visualize \" methods. There is a remarkable book [Gro3], which gives a vast panorama of \" geometrical mathematics from a metric viewpoint \". Unfortunately , Gromov's book seems hardly accessible to graduate students and non-experts in geometry. One of the objectives of this book is to bridge the gap between students and researchers interested in metric geometry, and modern mathematical literature. Prerequisite. It is minimal. We set a challenging goal of making the core part of the book accessible to first-year graduate students. Our expectations of the reader's background gradually grow as we move further in the book. We tried to introduce and illustrate most of new concepts and methods by using their simplest case and avoiding technicalities that take attention xi xii Preface away from the gist of the matter. For instance, our introduction to Riemann-ian geometry begins with metrics on planar regions, and we even avoid the notion of a manifold. Of course, manifolds do show up in more advanced sections. Some exercises and remarks assume more mathematical background than the rest of our exposition; they are optional, and a reader unfamiliar with some notions can just ignore them. For instance, solid background in differential geometry of curves and surfaces in R 3 is not a mandatory prerequisite for this book. However, we would hope that the reader possesses some knowledge of differential geometry, and from time to time we draw analogies \u2026"

We develop a staggered grid discretization that is well adapted to the computation of the $L^2$ optimal transport geodesic between distributions defined on a uniform spatial grid. We show how proximal splitting schemes can be used to solve the resulting large scale convex optimization problem. A specific instantiation of this method on a centered grid corresponds to the initial algorithm developed by Benamou and Brenier. We also show how more general cost functions can be taken into account and how to extend the method to perform optimal transport on a Riemannian manifold."

The mobility function from the scalar theory is replaced by a mobility matrix, that is subject to positivity and concavity conditions. Our primary motivation is to cast certain systems of nonlinear parabolic evolution equations in the variational framework of gradient flows.In the first part of the paper, we investigate the structural properties of the new class of distances like geodesic completeness.The second part is devoted to the identification of $$\\lambda $$\u03bb-geodesically convex functionals and their $$\\lambda $$\u03bb-contractive gradient flows. One of our results is a generalized McCann condition for geodesic convexity of the internal energy. In the third part, the existence of weak solutions to a certain class of degenerate drift-diffusion systems is shown. Even if the underlying energy function is not geodesically convex w.r.t. our new distance, the construction of a weak solution is still possible using de Giorgi\u2019s minimizing movement scheme."

Using a duality argument, we give a precise characterization of the population barycenter for compactly supported measures, and we make a connection between averaging in the Wasserstein space and taking the expectation of optimal transport maps. Then, the problem of estimating this barycenter from $n$ independent and identically distributed random probability measures is considered. To this end, we study the convergence of the empirical barycenter proposed in Agueh and Carlier (2011) to its population counterpart as the number of measures $n$ tends to infinity. To illustrate the benefits of this approach for data analysis and statistics, we show the usefulness of averaging in the Wasserstein space for curve and image warping. In this setting, we also study the rate of convergence of the empirical barycenter to its population counterpart for some semi-parametric models of random densities."

We elucidate how the two problems are linked, each being in a sense dual to the other. We first study the finite sample version of the problem in the continuum. Exploiting the tangent bundle structure of Wasserstein space, we deduce the Fr\\'echet mean via gradient descent. We show that this is equivalent to a Procrustes analysis for the registration maps, thus only requiring successive solutions to pairwise optimal coupling problems. We then study the population version of the problem, focussing on inference and stability: in practice, the data are i.i.d. realisations from a law on Wasserstein space, and indeed their observation is discrete, where one observes a proxy finite sample or point process. We construct regularised nonparametric estimators, and prove their consistency for the population mean, and uniform consistency for the population Procrustes registration maps."

These problems arise quite naturally by relaxing the marginal constraints typical of Optimal Transport problems: given a pair of finite measures (with possibly different total mass), one looks for minimizers of the sum of a linear transport functional and two convex entropy functionals, which quantify in some way the deviation of the marginals of the transport plan from the assigned measures. As a powerful application of this theory, we study the particular case of Logarithmic Entropy-Transport problems and introduce the new Hellinger\u2013Kantorovich distance between measures in metric spaces. The striking connection between these two seemingly far topics allows for a deep analysis of the geometric properties of the new geodesic distance, which lies somehow between the well-known Hellinger\u2013Kakutani and Kantorovich\u2013Wasserstein distances."

Here we consider a natural but largely unexplored variant of this problem by imposing a pointwise constraint on the joint (absolutely continuous) measures: among all joint densities with fixed marginals and which are dominated by a given density, find the optimal one. For this variant, we show local non-degeneracy of the cost function implies every minimizer is extremal in the convex set of competitors, hence unique. An appendix develops rudiments of a duality theory for this problem, which allows us to compute several suggestive examples."

If the cost per unit of mass is given by |x \u2212 y|2, we will see that uniqueness of solutions holds for $${m \\in [\\|f\\wedge g\\|_{L^1},\\min\\{\\|f\\|_{L^1},\\|g\\|_{L^1}\\}]}$$ . This extends the result of Caffarelli and McCann in Ann Math (in print), where the authors consider two densities with disjoint supports. The free boundaries of the active regions are shown to be (n \u2212 1)-rectifiable (provided the supports of f and g have Lipschitz boundaries), and under some weak regularity assumptions on the geometry of the supports they are also locally semiconvex. Moreover, assuming f and g supported on two bounded strictly convex sets $${{\\Omega,\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb {R}^n}}$$ , and bounded away from zero and infinity on their respective supports, $${C^{0,\\alpha}_{\\rm loc}}$$ regularity of the optimal transport map and local C1 regularity of the free boundaries away from $${{\\Omega\\cap \\Lambda}}$$ are shown. Finally, the optimal transport map extends to a global homeomorphism between the active regions."

Thus, it does not allow for congestion effects. Using the notion of traffic intensity, we propose a variant, taking into account congestion. This variant is a continuous version of a well-known traffic problem on networks that is studied both in economics and in operational research. The interest of this problem is in its relations with traffic equilibria of Wardrop type. What we prove in the paper is exactly the existence and the variational characterization of equilibria in a continuous space setting."

Using a duality argument, we give a precise characterization of the population barycenter for various parametric classes of random probability measures with compact support. In particular, we make a connection between averaging in the Wasserstein space as introduced in Agueh and Carlier (2011), and taking the expectation of optimal transport maps with respect to a fixed reference measure. We also discuss the usefulness of this approach in statistics for the analysis of deformable models in signal and image processing. In this setting, the problem of estimating a population barycenter from n independent and identically distributed random probability measures is also considered."

We focus in this paper on \\emph{Sinkhorn divergences} (SDs), a regularized variant of OT distances which can interpolate, depending on the regularization strength $\\varepsilon$, between OT ($\\varepsilon=0$) and MMD ($\\varepsilon=\\infty$). Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization is now well understood computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively $O(n^3\\log n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $n^2$ operations given a sample size $n$), much less is known in terms of their \\emph{sample complexity}, namely the gap between these quantities, when evaluated using finite samples \\emph{vs.} their respective densities. Indeed, while the sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, $1/n^{1/d}$ for OT in dimension $d$ and $1/\\sqrt{n}$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been studied empirically. In this paper, we \\emph{(i)} derive a bound on the approximation error made with SDs when approximating OT as a function of the regularizer $\\varepsilon$, \\emph{(ii)} prove that the optimizers of regularized OT are bounded in a Sobolev (RKHS) ball independent of the two measures and \\emph{(iii)} provide the first sample complexity bound for SDs, obtained,by reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS. We thus obtain a scaling in $1/\\sqrt{n}$ (as in MMD), with a constant that depends however on $\\varepsilon$, making the bridge between OT and MMD complete."

An accurate reconstruction would allow us to test cosmological models by simulating the evolution starting from the reconstructed primordial state and comparing it to observations. Several reconstruction techniques have been proposed, but they all suffer from lack of uniqueness because the velocities needed to produce a unique reconstruction usually are not known. Here we show that reconstruction can be reduced to a well-determined problem of optimization, and present a specific algorithm that provides excellent agreement when tested against data from N-body simulations. By applying our algorithm to the redshift surveys now under way, we will be able to recover reliably the properties of the primeval fluctuation field of the local Universe, and to determine accurately the peculiar velocities (deviations from the Hubble expansion) and the true positions of many more galaxies than is feasible by any other method."

In some cases simple linear interpolation yields meaningful results without requiring domain knowledge. However, interpolation between pairs of distributions or pairs of functions often demands more care because features may exhibit translational motion between exemplars. This property is not captured by linear interpolation. This paper develops the use of displacement interpolation for this class of problem, which provides a generic method for interpolating between distributions or functions based on advection instead of blending. The functions can be non-uniformly sampled, high-dimensional, and defined on non-Euclidean manifolds, e.g., spheres and tori. Our method decomposes distributions or functions into sums of radial basis functions (RBFs). We solve a mass transport problem to pair the RBFs and apply partial transport to obtain the interpolated function. We describe practical methods for computing the RBF decomposition and solving the transport problem. We demonstrate the interpolation approach on synthetic examples, BRDFs, color distributions, environment maps, stipple patterns, and value functions."

In analogy to continuous optimal transport, we provide a framework to verify global optimality of a discrete transport plan locally. This allows the construction of an algorithm to solve large dense problems by considering a sequence of sparse problems instead. The algorithm lends itself to being combined with a hierarchical multiscale scheme. Any existing discrete solver can be used as internal black-box. We explicitly describe how to select the sparse sub-problems for several cost functions, including the noisy squared Euclidean distance. Significant reductions in run-time and memory requirements have been observed."

We present a new method for particle image velocimetry, a technique using successive laser images of particles immersed in a fluid to measure the velocity field of the fluid flow. The main idea is to recover this velocity field via the solution of the L-optimal transport problem associated with each pair of successive distributions of tracers. We model the tracers by a network of Gaussian-like distributions and derive rigorous bounds on the approximation error in terms of the model\u2019s parameters. To obtain the numerical solution, we employ Newton\u2019s method, combined with an efficient spectral method, to solve the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation associated with the transport problem. We present numerical experiments based on two synthetic flow fields, a plane shear and an array of vortices. Although the theoretical results are derived for the case of a single particle in dimensions one and two, the results are valid in R, d\u22651. Moreover, the numerical experiments demonstrate that these results hold for the case of multiple particles, provided the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation is solved on a fine enough grid."

The numerical applications of this formulation have been limited by the difficulty to compute the Wasserstein distance in dimension $$\\geqslant $$\u2a7e2. One step of the JKO scheme is equivalent to a variational problem on the space of convex functions, which involves the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re operator. Convexity constraints are notably difficult to handle numerically, but in our setting the internal energy plays the role of a barrier for these constraints. This enables us to introduce a consistent discretization, which inherits convexity properties of the continuous variational problem. We show the effectiveness of our approach on nonlinear diffusion and crowd-motion models."

We provide algorithms for both these problems that, ignoring logarithmic factors involving the dimension of the input matrix and the size of its entries, both run in time \\widetilde{O}(m\\log \\kappa \\log^2 (1/&#x2265;ilon)) where &#x2265;ilon is the amount of error we are willing to tolerate. Here, \\kappa represents the ratio between the largest and the smallest entries of the optimal scalings. This implies that our algorithms run in nearly-linear time whenever \\kappa is quasi-polynomial, which includes, in particular, the case of strictly positive matrices. We complement our results by providing a separate algorithm that uses an interior-point method and runs in time \\widetilde{O}(m^{3/2} \\log (1/&#x2265;ilon)).In order to establish these results, we develop a new second-order optimization framework that enables us to treat both problems in a unified and principled manner. This framework identifies a certain generalization of linear system solving that we can use to efficiently minimize a broad class of functions, which we call second-order robust. We then show that in the context of the specific functions capturing matrix scaling and balancing, we can leverage and generalize the work on Laplacian system solving to make the algorithms obtained via this framework very efficient."

Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches."

The heat method is robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair of standard linear elliptic problems. The resulting systems can be prefactored once and subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance is updated an order of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. The method requires only standard differential operators and can hence be applied on a wide variety of domains (grids, triangle meshes, point clouds, etc.). We provide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of distance suitable for applications where greater regularity is required."

Here we describe a new transportation-based framework for analyzing sets of images. More specifically, we describe a new transportation-related distance between pairs of images, which we denote as linear optimal transportation (LOT). The LOT can be used directly on pixel intensities, and is based on a linearized version of the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric (an optimal transportation distance, as is the earth mover\u2019s distance). The new framework is especially well suited for computing all pairwise distances for a large database of images efficiently, and thus it can be used for pattern recognition in sets of images. In addition, the new LOT framework also allows for an isometric linear embedding, greatly facilitating the ability to visualize discriminant information in different classes of images. We demonstrate the application of the framework to several tasks such as discriminating nuclear chromatin patterns in cancer cells, decoding differences in facial expressions, galaxy morphologies, as well as sub cellular protein distributions."

This metric interpolates between the quadratic Wasserstein and the Fisher\u2013Rao metrics and generalizes optimal transport to measures with different masses. It is defined as a generalization of the dynamical formulation of optimal transport of Benamou and Brenier, by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. The influence of this source term is measured using the Fisher\u2013Rao metric and is averaged with the transportation term. This gives rise to a convex variational problem defining the new metric. Our first contribution is a proof of the existence of geodesics (i.e., solutions to this variational problem). We then show that (generalized) optimal transport and Hellinger metrics are obtained as limiting cases of our metric. Our last theoretical contribution is a proof that geodesics between mixtures of sufficiently close Dirac measures are made of translating mixtures of Dirac masses. Lastly, we propose a numerical scheme making use of first-order proximal splitting methods and we show an application of this new distance to image interpolation."

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances."

                "text": "Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark."

If a given optimization problem can be transformed to a convex equivalent, then this interpretive benefit is acquired.

This book is about convex optimization, convex geometry (with particular attention to distance geometry), geometrical problems, and problems that can be transformed into geometrical problems. Euclidean distance geometry is, fundamentally, a determination of point conformation from interpoint distance information; e.g., given only distance information, determine whether there corresponds a realizable configuration of points; a list of points in some dimension that attains the given interpoint distances. large black & white paperback"

The Monge mass transfer problem, as proposed by Monge in 1781, is to move points from one mass distribution to another so that a cost functional is minimized among all measure preserving maps. The existence of an optimal mapping was proved by Sudakov in 1979, using probability theory. A proof based on partial differential equations was recently found by Evans and Gangbo. In this paper we give a more elementary and shorter proof by constructing an optimal mapping directly from the potential functions of Monge and Kantorovich."

We assume there is a network of agents/machines/computers, and each agent holds a private continuous probability measure and seeks to compute the barycenter of all the measures in the network by getting samples from its local measure and exchanging information with its neighbors. Motivated by this problem, we develop, and analyze, a novel accelerated primal-dual stochastic gradient method for general stochastic convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints. Then, we apply this method to the decentralized distributed optimization setting to obtain a new algorithm for the distributed semi-discrete regularized Wasserstein barycenter problem. Moreover, we show explicit non-asymptotic complexity for the proposed algorithm."

We prove the convergence of the suitably interpolated in time implicit Euler scheme, defined in terms of the Euclidean Wasserstein distance, associated with this equation for subcritical masses. As a consequence, we recover the recent result about the global in time existence of weak solutions to the modified Patlak-Keller-Segel equation for the logarithmic interaction kernel in any dimension in the subcritical case. Moreover, we show how this method performs numerically in dimension one. In this particular case, this numerical scheme corresponds to a standard implicit Euler method for the pseudoinverse of the cumulative distribution function. We demonstrate its capabilities to reproduce the blow-up of solutions for supercritical masses easily without the need of mesh-refinement."

We first introduce a pseudopolynomial variant of the network simplex algorithm called the \u201cpremultiplier algorithm\u201d. We then develop a cost-scaling version of the premultiplier algorithm that solves the minimum cost flow problem in O(min(nm lognC, nm2 logn)) pivots. With certain simple data structures, the average time per pivot can be shown to be O(n). We also show that the diameter of the network polytope is O(nm logn)."

Dissecting Euclidean d -space with the power diagram of n weighted point sites partitions a given m -point set into clusters, one cluster for each region of the diagram. In this manner, an assignment of points to sites is induced. We show the equivalence of such assignments to constrained Euclidean least-squares assignments. As a corollary, there always exists a power diagram whose regions partition a given d -dimensional m -point set into clusters of prescribed sizes, no matter where the sites are placed. Another consequence is that constrained least-squares assignments can be computed by finding suitable weights for the sites. In the plane, this takes roughly O(n2m) time and optimal space O(m) , which improves on previous methods. We further show that a constrained least-squares assignment can be computed by solving a specially structured linear program in n+1 dimensions. This leads to an algorithm for iteratively improving the weights, based on the gradient-descent method. Besides having the obvious optimization property, least-squares assignments are shown to be useful in solving a certain transportation problem, and in finding a least-squares fitting of two point sets where translation and scaling are allowed. Finally, we extend the concept of a constrained least-squares assignment to continuous distributions of points, thereby obtaining existence results for power diagrams with prescribed region volumes. These results are related to Minkowski's theorem for convex polytopes. The aforementioned iterative method for approximating the desired power diagram applies to continuous distributions as well."

Motivated by fluid flow-based transportation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, however, this paper introduces an alternative definition of optimal transportation between distributions over graph vertices. This new distance still satisfies the triangle inequality but has better scaling and a connection to continuous theories of transportation. It is constructed by adapting a Riemannian structure over probability distributions to the graph case, providing transportation distances as shortest-paths in probability space. After defining and analyzing theoretical properties of our new distance, we provide a time discretization as well as experiments verifying its effectiveness."

Rather than using a large linear program with a quadratic number of variables, we apply the theory of optimal transportation and pass to a dual differential formulation with linear scaling. After discretization using finite elements (FEM) and development of an accompanying optimization method, we apply our new EMD to problems in graphics and geometry processing. In particular, we uncover a class of smooth distances on a surface transitioning from a purely spectral distance to the geodesic distance between points; these distances also can be extended to the volume inside and outside the surface. A number of additional applications of our machinery to geometry problems in graphics are presented."

The success of transport based distances is in part due to their Lagrangian nature which allows it to capture the important variations in many signal classes. However these distances require the signal to be nonnegative and normalized. Furthermore, the signals are considered as measures and compared by redistributing (transporting) them, which does not directly take into account the signal intensity. Here we study a transport-based distance, called the $TL^p$ distance, that combines Lagrangian and intensity modelling and is directly applicable to general, non-positive and multi-channelled signals. The framework allows the application of existing numerical methods. We give an overview of the basic properties of this distance and applications to classification, with multi-channelled, non-positive one and two-dimensional signals, and color transfer."

The PDE of concern, of Hele-Shaw type, was introduced by Perthame et. al. as a mechanical model for tumor growth and the metric was introduced recently in several articles as the analogue of the Wasserstein metric for nonnegative measures. We show existence of solutions using minimizing movements and show uniqueness of solutions on convex domains by proving the Evolutional Variational Inequality. Our analysis does not require any regularity assumption on the initial condition. We also derive a numerical scheme based on the discretization of the gradient flow and the idea of entropic regularization. We assess the convergence of the scheme on explicit solutions. In doing this analysis, we prove several new properties of the optimal transport-growth metric, which generally have a known counterpart for the Wasserstein metric."

The computation of this quantity, despite being the subject of a significant research effort in algebraic statistics, remains an intractable challenge for histograms of even modest dimensions. We propose an alternative kernel which, rather than considering all matrices of the transportation polytope, only focuses on a sub-sample of its vertices known as its Northwestern corner solutions. The resulting kernel is positive definite and can be computed with a number of operations O(R^2d) that grows linearly in the complexity of the dimension d, where R^2, the total amount of sampled vertices, is a parameter that controls the complexity of the kernel."

These methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to massive data by dividing the full data into a sufficiently large number of data subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter in a Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of approximation that are valid in many applications. We show that the geometric method approximates the full data posterior distribution better than its competitors across diverse simulations and reproduces known results when applied to a movie ratings database."

                "text": "The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions (i.e. two probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function."

We prove existence of equilibria and fully characterize them as solutions to some convex optimization problems. The main mathematical tools are convex duality and mass transportation theory. Uniqueness and purity of equilibria are discussed. We will also give an alternative linear-programming formulation as in the recent work of Chiappori et al. (Econ Theory, to appear)."

On an input n&#x00D7; n matrix A, this problem asks to find diagonal (scaling) matrices X and Y (if they exist), so that X A Y &#x03B5;-approximates a doubly stochastic matrix, or more generally a matrix with prescribed row and column sums.We address the general scaling problem as well as some important special cases. In particular, if A has m nonzero entries, and if there exist X and Y with polynomially large entries such that X A Y is doubly stochastic, then we can solve the problem in total complexity \\tilde{O}(m + n^{4/3}). This greatly improves on the best known previous results, which were either \\tilde{O}(n^4) or O(m n^{1/2}/&#x03B5;).Our algorithms are based on tailor-made first and second order techniques, combined with other recent advances in continuous optimization, which may be of independent interest for solving similar problems."

As a consequence newcomers started to reprove results from the above papers. - Here I explain the older history. The Euclidean center of mass is an affinenotion. I will use discrete mass points rather than mass distributions, for simpler wording. Let pi 2 R n be points of weight mi with P mi = 1 (for convenience).

To overcome the time complexity involved by the numerical solving of such problem, the original Wasserstein metric is replaced by a sliced approximation over 1D distributions. This enables us to introduce a new fast gradient descent algorithm to compute Wasserstein barycenters of point clouds. \n \nThis new notion of barycenter of probabilities is likely to find applications in computer vision where one wants to average features defined as distributions. We show an application to texture synthesis and mixing, where a texture is characterized by the distribution of the response to a multi-scale oriented filter bank. This leads to a simple way to navigate over a convex domain of color textures."

This algorithm is of interest for several reasons, but especially because of its role in certain computational methods based on duality, such as the Hestenes-Powell method of multipliers in nonlinear programming. It is investigated here in a more general form where the requirement for exact minimization at each iteration is weakened, and the subdifferential $\\partial f$ is replaced by an arbitrary maximal monotone operator T. Convergence is established under several criteria amenable to implementation. The rate of convergence is shown to be \u201ctypically\u201d linear with an arbitrarily good modulus if $c_k $ stays large enough, in fact superlinear if $c_k \\to \\infty $.

These differences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons: sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart, affecting their individual measurements. Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian inference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while respecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself. Improving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient, parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete, needing to discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge, we also provide the first bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the discretization becomes finer. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method, both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere, as well as in a large-scale Bayesian inference task."

The practical applicability of this temporal complexity result, due originally to Linnainmaa, seemed to be severely limited by the fact that the memory requirement of the basic implementation is proportional to the run timeT, of the original evaluation program. It is shown here that, by a recursive scheme related to the multilevel differentiation approach of Volin and Ostrovskii, the growth in both temporal and spatial complexity can be limited to a fixed multiple of log(T). Other compromises between the run time and memory requirement are possible, so that the reverse mode becomes applicable to computational problems of virtually any size."

The variational class of mean field games, introduced by Lasry and Lions, may also be interpreted as a generalization of the time-dependent optimal transport problem. Following Benamou and Brenier, we show that augmented Lagrangian methods are well suited to treat such convex but non-smooth problems. They include in particular Monge historic optimal transport problem. A finite-element discretization and implementation of the method are used to provide numerical simulations and a convergence study."

First, the shape region is decomposed into a number of small clusters by Fuzzy C-Means clustering. Next, the EMD between the clusters of two key shapes is calculated and the resultant EMD flows are exploited as a weighted manyto-many correspondence among the clusters. Then, the fuzzy clusters are transported based on the EMD flows and a transition control parameter. Unlike the closed curve/surface-based methods, the morphs using cluster transportation are not guaranteed to be a binary image, and hence graph cut-based binary denoising is applied to a volumetric image of the two-dimensional position and the one-dimensional transition control parameter. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform morphing between shapes with different genera, such as walking silhouettes or alphabetical characters."

At its core is a novel formulation of the recently-introduced concept of capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation as an optimal transport problem. This insight leads to a continuous formulation able to enforce the capacity constraints exactly, unlike previous work. We exploit the variational nature of this formulation to design an efficient optimization technique of point distributions via constrained minimization in the space of power diagrams. Our mathematical, algorithmic, and practical contributions lead to high-quality blue noise point sets with improved spectral and spatial properties."

                "text": "We propose EMD-L1: a fast and exact algorithm for computing the earth mover's distance (EMD) between a pair of histograms. The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L1-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks"

We show that the dual formulation of Wasserstein variational problems introduced recently by G. Carlier, A. Oberman, and E. Oudet [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 6 (2015), pp. 1621--1642] can be regularized using an entropic smoothing, which leads to smooth, differentiable, convex optimization problems that are simpler to implement and numerically more stable. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by applying it to the computation of Wasserstein barycenters and gradient flows of spacial regularization functionals. (A correction is attached.)"

                "text": "The use of optimal transport distance has recently yielded significant progress in image processing for pattern recognition, shape identification, and histograms matching. In this study, the use of this distance is investigated for a seismic tomography problem exploiting the complete waveform; the full waveform inversion. In its conventional formulation, this high resolution seismic imaging method is based on the minimization of the L2 distance between predicted and observed data. Application of this method is generally hampered by the local minima of the associated L2 misfit function, which correspond to velocity models matching the data up to one or several phase shifts. Conversely, the optimal transport distance appears as a more suitable tool to compare the misfit between oscillatory signals, for its ability to detect shifted patterns. However, its application to the full waveform inversion is not straightforward, as the mass conservation between the compared data cannot be guaranteed, a crucial assumption for optimal transport. In this study, the use of a distance based on the Kantorovich\u2013Rubinstein norm is introduced to overcome this difficulty. Its mathematical link with the optimal transport distance is made clear. An efficient numerical strategy for its computation, based on a proximal splitting technique, is introduced. We demonstrate that each iteration of the corresponding algorithm requires solving the Poisson equation, for which fast solvers can be used, relying either on the fast Fourier transform or on multigrid techniques. The development of this numerical method make possible applications to industrial scale data, involving tenths of millions of discrete unknowns. The results we obtain on such large scale synthetic data illustrate the potentialities of the optimal transport for seismic imaging. Starting from crude initial velocity models, optimal transport based inversion yields significantly better velocity reconstructions than those based on the L2 distance, in 2D and 3D contexts."

We show that the OT problem can be equivalently written in terms of probabilistic encoders, which are constrained to match the posterior and prior distributions over the latent space. When relaxed, this constrained optimization problem leads to a penalized optimal transport (POT) objective, which can be efficiently minimized using stochastic gradient descent by sampling from $P_X$ and $P_G$. We show that POT for the 2-Wasserstein distance coincides with the objective heuristically employed in adversarial auto-encoders (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2016), which provides the first theoretical justification for AAEs known to the authors. We also compare POT to other popular techniques like variational auto-encoders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014). Our theoretical results include (a) a better understanding of the commonly observed blurriness of images generated by VAEs, and (b) establishing duality between Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017) and POT for the 1-Wasserstein distance."

We propose a quantum-entropic regularization of the resulting convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently using an iterative scaling algorithm. This method is a generalization of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm to the quantum setting of PSD matrices.

Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas\u2013Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for l1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations."

The answer to this question is known as Sinkhorn's theorem. It has been proved with a wide variety of methods, each presenting a variety of possible generalisations. Recently, generalisations such as to positive maps between matrix algebras have become more and more interesting for applications. This text gives a review of over 70 years of matrix scaling. The focus lies on the mathematical landscape surrounding the problem and its solution as well as the generalisation to positive maps and contains hardly any nontrivial unpublished results."

In the large, for a large class of data, the existence of minimal geodesics may fail, as shown by Shnirelman [26].

We discuss the advantages of this approach, over a standard functional PCA of probability densities in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. We establish the consistency of the method by showing that the empirical GPCA converges to its population counterpart, as the sample size tends to infinity. A key property in the study of GPCA is the isometry between the Wasserstein space and a closed convex subset of the space of square-integrable functions, with respect to an appropriate measure. Therefore, we consider the general problem of PCA in a closed convex subset of a separable Hilbert space, which serves as basis for the analysis of GPCA and also has interest in its own right. We provide illustrative examples on simple statistical models, to show the benefits of this approach for data analysis. The method is also applied to a real dataset of population pyramids."

However, a standard implementation of the scaling algorithm has several numerical limitations: the scaling factors diverge and convergence becomes impractically slow as the entropy regularization approaches zero. Moreover, handling the dense kernel matrix becomes unfeasible for large problems. To address this, we combine several modifications: A log-domain stabilized formulation, the well-known epsilon-scaling heuristic, an adaptive truncation of the kernel and a coarse-to-fine scheme. This permits the solution of larger problems with smaller regularization and negligible truncation error. A new convergence analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm is developed, working towards a better understanding of epsilon-scaling. Numerical examples illustrate efficiency and versatility of the modified algorithm."

                "text": "Optimal transport distances have been used for more than a decade in machine learning to compare histograms of features. They have one parameter: the ground metric, which can be any metric between the features themselves. As is the case for all parameterized distances, optimal transport distances can only prove useful in practice when this parameter is carefully chosen. To date, the only option available to practitioners to set the ground metric parameter was to rely on a priori knowledge of the features, which limited considerably the scope of application of optimal transport distances. We propose to lift this limitation and consider instead algorithms that can learn the ground metric using only a training set of labeled histograms. We call this approach ground metric learning. We formulate the problem of learning the ground metric as the minimization of the difference of two convex polyhedral functions over a convex set of metric matrices. We follow the presentation of our algorithms with promising experimental results which show that this approach is useful both for retrieval and binary/multiclass classification tasks."

                "text": "Surface based 3D shape analysis plays a fundamental role in computer vision and medical imaging. This work proposes to use optimal mass transport map for shape matching and comparison, focusing on two important applications including surface registration and shape space. The computation of the optimal mass transport map is based on Monge-Brenier theory, in comparison to the conventional method based on Monge-Kantorovich theory, this method significantly improves the efficiency by reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to O(n). For surface registration problem, one commonly used approach is to use conformal map to convert the shapes into some canonical space. Although conformal mappings have small angle distortions, they may introduce large area distortions which are likely to cause numerical instability thus resulting failures of shape analysis. This work proposes to compose the conformal map with the optimal mass transport map to get the unique area-preserving map, which is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, unique, and diffeomorphic. For shape space study, this work introduces a novel Riemannian framework, Conformal Wasserstein Shape Space, by combing conformal geometry and optimal mass transport theory. In our work, all metric surfaces with the disk topology are mapped to the unit planar disk by a conformal mapping, which pushes the area element on the surface to a probability measure on the disk. The optimal mass transport provides a map from the shape space of all topological disks with metrics to the Wasserstein space of the disk and the pullback Wasserstein metric equips the shape space with a Riemannian metric. We validate our work by numerous experiments and comparisons with prior approaches and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed approach."

                "text": "Introduction Square matrices whose entries are all nonnegative have special properties. This was mentioned briefly in Section 5.3 with a sketch of the proof when all entries of the matrix are positive appearing as item 5K. The result was first proved by Perron in the case when all entries are positive. Frobenius then filled in all the details to identify the nature of all exceptions. We will follow the history of the subject by dealing with positive matrices before examining the modifications needed for general nonnegative matrices. The theorem asserts that there is a eigenvector, all of whose entries are nonnegative, of such a matrix and then goes on to give further properties of this eigenvector and its eigenvalue. Markov matricesM are a special case, and we have seen that a probabilistic interpretation of the solution ofMv = v based on a claim that all entries of v are nonnegative. In keeping with this probabilistic interpretation, it is customary to scale the nonnegative eigenvector so that the sum of its entries is 1, rather that use theEuclideanscaling that has the sum of the squaresof the entries equal to 1 that is useful elsewhere. These notes include material from F. R. Gantmacher, The Theory of Matrices , Chelsea, 1990, Chapter XIII and Roger A. Horn & Charles R. Johnson, Matrix Analysis, Cambridge, 1985, Chapter 8. However, all expositions aimed at mathematicians emphasize an efficient path to a proof. This may not be the best approach for those more interested in applying the results. The subject also has features that relate this topic to other areas of linear algebra and suggest methods to approximate the positive eigenvector and its eigenvalue. These features will also be discussed. We work in a fixed space, which can be taken to be Cn, so that all vectors have n components and all matrices aren by n. Since we are concerned with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the matrix must be considered as mapping this space to itself. It is only the eigenvalue with a positive eigenvector that is distinguished in this theory. It will be called thedominant eigenvalue, since the other eigenvalues will be shown to be of smaller absolute value. In particular, the remaining eigenvalues need not be real . The Role of nonnegativity Write v \u2265 w to denote the property that no entry of the vectorv is smaller than the corresponding entry of w. If every entry of a matrixA is nonnegative, then v \u2265 w implies Av \u2265 Aw since the difference of i th entries is"

In the past few years a random matrix ensemble and the corresponding joint probability density function of its eigenvalues was identified. Moreover, a relation with the Cauchy two-matrix model was discovered but never thoroughly investigated, leaving open in particular the following question: How are the kernels of the Pfaffian point process of the Bures random matrix ensemble related to the ones of the determinantal point process of the Cauchy two-matrix model, and moreover, how can it be possible that a Pfaffian point process derives from a determinantal point process? We give a very explicit answer to this question. The aim of our work has a quite practical origin since the calculation of the level statistics of the Bures ensemble is highly mathematically involved while we know the statistics of the Cauchy two-matrix ensemble. Therefore, we solve the whole level statistics of a density operator drawn from the Bures prior."

                "text": "true for calculating moments and generating functions. Graphing also is easy using Mathematica\u2019s powerful graphical capabilities. A few pages are devoted to copulas; again, these are easy to implement. Chapter 7 (26 pp.) covers unbiased estimation of population moments, moments of moments, and augmented symmetrics and power sums. Moment conversion formulas reappear and are extended to the k statistics (unbiased estimators of cumulants) and the h statistics (unbiased estimators of central moments). The power of this book is amply conveyed when the former are easily extended to the generalized k statistics known as \u201cpolykays\u201d (plural of poly-k); and in an apparent novelty, the latter are extended to \u201cpoly-aches\u201d (plural of poly-h). The accuracy of mathStatica/Mathematica is illustrated by revealing errors in long-used formulas in published references (e.g., Eq. 12.70 in Stuart and Ord 1986; the product-cumulant formula \u01604325). This formula contains some 12 terms, and the correct version (with a demonstration of correctness) is given in this chapter. Examples of published errors in other references occur throughout the book. While testing mathStatica, the authors compiled a lengthy list of such errors that is available at the book\u2019s website, www.mathstatica.com. Chapter 8, \u201cAsymptotic Distributions\u201d (24 pp.), covers convergence in distribution, asymptotic distribution, the central-limit theorem, convergence in probability, van Beek\u2019s bound, and the inequalities of Chebyshev and Markov. A distinct pedagogical advantage of using the computer to teach these concepts is that the student can \u008e ddle with n and other parameters, and observe the convergence rates. With only a couple of exceptions, all cases considered are i.i.d., so the treatment is at an elementary level. Chapter 9, \u201cStatistical Decision Theory\u201d (24 pp.), covers loss and risk, mean squared error as risk, and order statistics. With the power of a computer, it becomes easy to compute and graph risk and other such quantities. The mathStatica function OrderStat automates the calculation of the pdf or joint pdf of an order statistic, and it is used extensively in this chapter. Chapter 10, on unbiased parameter estimation (24 pp.) covers Fisher information, best unbiased estimators, suf\u008e cient statistics, and minimum-variance unbiased estimation, including the Rao\u2013Blackwell theorem. As always, a bene\u008e t of mathStatica/Mathematica is the elimination of technical drudgery. Example 2 of this chapter, computing the information lost due to censoring of a Poisson variable with parameter \u2039, is almost trivial. Thus, exploring various aspects of the problem (e.g., graphing relative information against \u2039) becomes easy. Chapter 11, \u201cPrinciples of Maximum Likelihood Estimation\u201d (30 pp.), covers the likelihood function, maximum likelihood estimation, and properties of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). This chapter constitutes preparation for Chapter 12 (42 pp.), which covers use of the FindMaximum command and various optimization algorithms, including BFGS and Newton\u2013Raphson. It pays admirable attention to numerical detail. The three basic types of MLE standard errors (Fisher, Hessian, and OPG) are introduced and compared. An extended autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) example is used illustratively. I can af\u008e rm that doing nonlinear estimation is much easier with mathStatica than with Mathematica alone. Various appendices, notes, and references (64 pp.) conclude the text. The entire book, chapter by chapter, is duplicated as Mathematica notebooks. There is no need to read a sequence of commands in the text and then type them into the computer; the reader can open up the relevant chapter notebook and click on the commands. The reader can interactively modify and experiment with the examples in the text. For readers who do not already have it, the book comes with a 30-day trial version of Mathematica. Sixty days would have been better, and unfortunately this trial version also does not allow the user to save worksheets. Each chapter concludes with several exercises, 101 altogether. A detailed solutions manual is available to instructors of courses using the text. The small number of exercises should not cause concern; any instructor, having seen the exercises and the detailed solutions, would have little trouble conjuring up more exercises. Moreover, any mathematical statistics text will be \u008e lled with problems that can be assigned for solution with mathStatica. The preface makes the salient point that \u201cwhen one is armed with mathStatica, the whole notion of what is dif\u008e cult changes,\u201d and this theme recurs throughout the book. Already a couple of examples have been given. Here is one more: Moments of moments are conceptually easy, and for higher orders are notoriously dif\u008e cult without mathStatica. With it, they are no harder than invoking a single command. This book will be of immediate use to four classes of persons: (1) any person who would do more of the Hogg\u2013Craig\u2013style basics, if only it were much easier, (2) people who work with real data whose needs are ill met by traditional statistical packages (e.g., actuaries); (3) persons whose computational needs consistently bump into the bounds of traditional software (e.g., econometricians working with esoteric distributions), and (4) teachers who want to innovate the traditional mathematical statistics curriculum. This book has the potential to revolutionize the teaching of mathematical statistics. Typically, a professor using the text by Hogg and Craig (1995) might choose a few problems from each section and assign them, knowing that tedious mathematical drudgery will occupy much of the student\u2019s time. However, if Mathematical Statistics with Mathematica is used as a supplement, then the professor can simply ask students to solve all or most of the problems in the chapter. Again, if the student does not know the Hogg and Craig material, then mathStatica will be of little use. I expect that in a couple of years, some journal will publish a \u201creport from the \u008e eld\u201d that describes the collective experience of professors who have chosen to use this book in conjunction with a standard \u008e rst-year text. Such a report will make for most interesting\u2014and perhaps revolutionary\u2014reading. While writing an earlier article (McCullough 2000), Internet searches convinced me (no great surprise) that very few persons were using Mathematica for statistical purposes. I shall be equally surprised if the present volume does not change this. These internet searches put me in touch with one of the authors of the book, and I wound up beta-testing mathStatica. Other than a review copy of the book, I received nothing other than a wonderful time playing with the included software."

Denote by \u0393(\u03bc1,\u2026, \u03bcN) the set of all N-tuples T=(T1,\u2026, TN) such that Ti:\u211dd \u211dd (i = 1,\u2026, N) are Borel-measurable and satisfy \u03bc1 = \u03bci[V] for all Borel V \u2282 \u211dd. The multidimensional Monge-Kantorovich problem investigated in this paper consists of finding S=(S1,\u2026, SN) \u2208 \u0393(\u03bc1,\u2026, \u03bcN) minimizing over the set \u0393(\u03bc1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, \u03bcN). We study the case where the \u03bci's have finite second moments and vanish on (d - 1)-rectifiable sets. We prove existence and uniqueness of optimal maps S when we impose that S1(x) \u2261 x and give an explicit form of the maps Si. The result is obtained by variational methods and to the best of our knowledge is the first available in the literature in this generality. As a consequence, we obtain uniqueness and characterization of an optimal measure for the multidimensional Kantorovich problem. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between underlying random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that provides a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of n elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex $$S_{n-1}$$Sn-1, which is the set of all probability distributions over n elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in $$S_{n-1}$$Sn-1 by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution $${\\varvec{p}}$$p to distribution $${\\varvec{q}}$$q, where $${\\varvec{p}}$$p, $${\\varvec{q}} \\in S_{n-1}$$q\u2208Sn-1. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost $$C({\\varvec{p}}, {\\varvec{q}})$$C(p,q) was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at $${\\varvec{p}}={\\varvec{q}}$$p=q. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold $$S_{n-1} \\times S_{n-1}$$Sn-1\u00d7Sn-1 composed of all optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in $$S_{n-1}$$Sn-1 that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence."

We use Wasserstein distances between empirical distributions of observed data and empirical distributions of synthetic data drawn from such models to estimate their parameters. Previous interest in the Wasserstein distance for statistical inference has been mainly theoretical, due to computational limitations. Thanks to recent advances in numerical transport, the computation of these distances has become feasible, up to controllable approximation errors. We leverage these advances to propose point estimators and quasi-Bayesian distributions for parameter inference, first for independent data. For dependent data, we extend the approach by using delay reconstruction and residual reconstruction techniques. For large data sets, we propose an alternative distance using the Hilbert space-filling curve, which computation scales as nlogn where n is the size of the data. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed estimators, and adaptive Monte Carlo algorithms to approximate them. The approach is illustrated on four examples: a quantile g-and-k distribution, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a Lotka-Volterra model for plankton population sizes and a L\\'evy-driven stochastic volatility model."

A shortcoming is also presented that exists in all of the widely used implementations of the algorithm, namely, that the quality of the ordering provided by the implementations is surprisingly sensitive to the initial ordering. For example, changing the input ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as much as a factor of three in the cost of the subsequent numerical factorization. This sensitivity is caused by the lack of an effective tie-breaking strategy, and the authors\u2019 experiments illustrate the importance of developing such a strategy"

                "text": "Algorithmic, or automatic, differentiation (AD) is a growing area of theoretical research and software development concerned with the accurate and efficient evaluation of derivatives for function evaluations given as computer programs. The resulting derivative values are useful for all scientific computations that are based on linear, quadratic, or higher order approximations to nonlinear scalar or vector functions. AD has been applied in particular to optimization, parameter identification, nonlinear equation solving, the numerical integration of differential equations, and combinations of these. Apart from quantifying sensitivities numerically, AD also yields structural dependence information, such as the sparsity pattern and generic rank of Jacobian matrices. The field opens up an exciting opportunity to develop new algorithms that reflect the true cost of accurate derivatives and to use them for improvements in speed and reliability. This second edition has been updated and expanded to cover recent developments in applications and theory, including an elegant NP completeness argument by Uwe Naumann and a brief introduction to scarcity, a generalization of sparsity. There is also added material on checkpointing and iterative differentiation. To improve readability the more detailed analysis of memory and complexity bounds has been relegated to separate, optional chapters.The book consists of three parts: a stand-alone introduction to the fundamentals of AD and its software; a thorough treatment of methods for sparse problems; and final chapters on program-reversal schedules, higher derivatives, nonsmooth problems and iterative processes. Each of the 15 chapters concludes with examples and exercises. Audience: This volume will be valuable to designers of algorithms and software for nonlinear computational problems. Current numerical software users should gain the insight necessary to choose and deploy existing AD software tools to the best advantage.

For massive data, it is necessary to store and process subsets on dierent machines in a distributed manner. We propose a simple, general, and highly ecient approach, which first runs a posterior sampling algorithm in parallel on dierent machines for subsets of a large data set. To combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly ecient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP) has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data. We provide theoretical justification in terms of posterior consistency and algorithm eciency. Exam"

Smith (1994, Linear Algebra Appl.199, 363?371) characterizations of solutions of three-coupling problems by reduction to the construction of optimal couplings of each of the variables to the sum. In the case of normal distributions this leads to a complete solution. Under a technical condition this idea also works for general distributions and one obtains explicit results. We extend these results to the n-coupling problem and derive a characterization of optimal n-couplings by several 2-coupling problems. This leads to some constructive existence results for Monge solutions."

In contrast to many learning objectives, however, the ranking problem presents difficulties due to the fact that the space of permutations is not smooth. In this paper, we examine the class of rank-linear objective functions, which includes popular metrics such as precision and discounted cumulative gain. In particular, we observe that expectations of these gains are completely characterized by the marginals of the corresponding distribution over permutation matrices. Thus, the expectations of rank-linear objectives can always be described through locations in the Birkhoff polytope, i.e., doubly-stochastic matrices (DSMs). We propose a technique for learning DSM-based ranking functions using an iterative projection operator known as Sinkhorn normalization. Gradients of this operator can be computed via backpropagation, resulting in an algorithm we call Sinkhorn propagation, or SinkProp. This approach can be combined with a wide range of gradient-based approaches to rank learning. We demonstrate the utility of SinkProp on several information retrieval data sets."

We show that these equations arise as gradient flows of certain entropy functionals with respect to suitable non-local transportation metrics. This may be seen as a discrete analogue of the Wasserstein gradient flow structure for porous medium equations in R^n discovered by Otto. We present a one-dimensional counterexample to geodesic convexity and discuss Gromov-Hausdorff convergence to the Wasserstein metric."

We analyze the properties of the relaxed distance, we show a close link between the Lagrangian and the Eulerian model, and we derive necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for minimizers. These conditions take into account a modified Lagrangian induced by the pressure field. Moreover, adapting some ideas of Shnirelman, we show that, even for non-deterministic final conditions, generalized flows can be approximated in energy by flows associated to measure-preserving maps."

The prototype method, from which the other algorithms can be derived, is the auction algorithm for the assignment problem. This is an intuitive method that operates like a rel auction where persons compete for objects by raising their prices through competitive bidding; the prices can be viewed as dual variables. Conceptually, auction algorithms represent a significant departure from the cost improvement idea that underlies primal simplex and dual ascent methods; at any one iteration, they may deteriorate both the primal and the dual cost. Auction algorithms perform very well for several important types of problems, both in theory and in practice, and they are also well suited for parallel computation."

This is the first comprehensive and unified introduction to nonlinear Perron\u2013Frobenius theory suitable for graduate students and researchers entering the field for the first time. It acquaints the reader with recent developments and provides a guide to challenging open problems. To enhance accessibility, the focus is on finite dimensional nonlinear Perron\u2013Frobenius theory, but pointers are provided to infinite dimensional results. Prerequisites are little more than basic real analysis and topology."

Automatic differentiation consists of exact algorithms on floating-point arguments. This implementation overloads standard elementary operators and functions in MATLAB with a derivative rule in addition to the function value; for example, $\\sin u$ will also compute $(\\cos u)\\ast u^{\\prime}$, where $u$ and $u^{\\prime }$ are numerical values. These methods are mostly one-line programs that operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects, providing a simple example of object-oriented programming in MATLAB using the new (as of release 2008a) class definition structure. The resulting powerful tool computes derivative values and multivariable gradients, and is applied to Newton's method for root-finding in both single and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order derivatives of a single-variable function, another class of series objects keeps Taylor polynomial coefficients up to some order. Overloading multiplication on series objects is a combination (discrete convolution) of coefficients. This idea leads to algorithms for other operations and functions on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in automatic differentiation includes an introduction to the reverse mode (our implementation is forward mode) and considerations in arbitrary-order multivariable series computation."

We extend some results of F. Bolley, A. Guillin and C. Villani with simple proofs. Our methods are based on concentration inequalities and extend to the general setting of measures on a Polish space. Deviation bounds for the occupation measure of a contracting Markov chain in 1-Wasserstein distance are also given. Throughout the text, several examples are worked out, including the cases of Gaussian measures on separable Banach spaces, and laws of diffusion processes."

The literature is old and rich, with a wide variety of statistics having being intelligently designed and analyzed, both for the unidimensional and the multivariate setting. Our contribution is to tie together many of these tests, drawing connections between seemingly very different statistics. In this work, our central object is the Wasserstein distance, as we form a chain of connections from univariate methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, PP/QQ plots and ROC/ODC curves, to multivariate tests involving energy statistics and kernel based maximum mean discrepancy. Some connections proceed through the construction of a \\textit{smoothed} Wasserstein distance, and others through the pursuit of a \"distribution-free\" Wasserstein test. Some observations in this chain are implicit in the literature, while others seem to have not been noticed thus far. Given nonparametric two sample testing's classical and continued importance, we aim to provide useful connections for theorists and practitioners familiar with one subset of methods but not others."

Our work makes the following assumption: there exists a non-linear transformation between the joint feature/label space distributions of the two domain $\\mathcal{P}_s$ and $\\mathcal{P}_t$. We propose a solution of this problem with optimal transport, that allows to recover an estimated target $\\mathcal{P}^f_t=(X,f(X))$ by optimizing simultaneously the optimal coupling and $f$. We show that our method corresponds to the minimization of a bound on the target error, and provide an efficient algorithmic solution, for which convergence is proved. The versatility of our approach, both in terms of class of hypothesis or loss functions is demonstrated with real world classification and regression problems, for which we reach or surpass state-of-the-art results."

Few techniques, however, are available to measure their continuity and other properties. To this end, we introduce a novel Dirichlet energy for soft maps generalizing the classical map Dirichlet energy, which measures distortion by computing how soft maps transport probabilistic mass from one distribution to another. We formulate the computation of the Dirichlet energy in terms of a differential equation and provide a finite elements discretization that enables all of the quantities introduced to be computed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for understanding soft maps arising from various sources. Furthermore, we suggest how these energies can be applied to generate continuous soft or point\u2010to\u2010point maps."

It is a natural metric for comparing sets of features, and as such, it has received significant interest in computer vision. Motivated by recent developments in that area, we address computational problems involving EMD over <i>high-dimensional</i> pointsets.\n A natural approach is to embed the EMD metric into <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>, and use the algorithms designed for the latter space. However, Khot and Naor [KN06] show that any embedding of EMD over the <i>d</i>-dimensional Hamming cube into <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> must incur a distortion \u03a9<i>(d)</i>, thus practically losing all distance information. We circumvent this roadblock by focusing on sets with cardinalities upper-bounded by a parameter <i>s</i>, and achieve a distortion of only <i>O</i>(log <i>s</i> \u00b7 log <i>d</i>). Since in applications the feature sets have bounded size, the resulting distortion is much smaller than the \u03a9<i>(d)</i> lower bound. Our approach is quite general and easily extends to EMD over \u211d<i><sup>d</sup>.</i>\n We then provide a strong lower bound on the multi-round communicatic complexity of estimating EMD, which in particular strengthens the known non-embeddability result of [KN06]. Our bound exhibits a smooth tradeoff between approximation and communication, and for example implies that every algorithm that estimates EMD using constant size sketches can only achieve \u03c9(log <i>s</i>) approximation."

Our first goal here is to formulate a free boundary model of Hele\u2013Shaw type, a variant including growth terms, starting from the description at the cell level and passing to the stiff limit in the pressure law of state. In contrast with the classical Hele\u2013Shaw problem, here the geometric motion governed by the pressure is not sufficient to completely describe the dynamics. A complete description requires the equation on the cell number density. We then go on to consider a more complex model including the supply of nutrients through vasculature, and we study the stiff limit for the involved coupled system."

                "text": "A class of distance measures on probabilities -- the integral probability metrics (IPMs) -- is addressed: these include the Wasserstein distance, Dudley metric, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy. IPMs have thus far mostly been used in more abstract settings, for instance as theoretical tools in mass transportation problems, and in metrizing the weak topology on the set of all Borel probability measures defined on a metric space. Practical applications of IPMs are less common, with some exceptions in the kernel machines literature. The present work contributes a number of novel properties of IPMs, which should contribute to making IPMs more widely used in practice, for instance in areas where $\\phi$-divergences are currently popular. \nFirst, to understand the relation between IPMs and $\\phi$-divergences, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which these classes intersect are derived: the total variation distance is shown to be the only non-trivial $\\phi$-divergence that is also an IPM. This shows that IPMs are essentially different from $\\phi$-divergences. Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs from finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence rates are analyzed. These estimators are shown to be easily computable, with better rates of convergence than estimators of $\\phi$-divergences. Third, a novel interpretation is provided for IPMs by relating them to binary classification, where it is shown that the IPM between class-conditional distributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary classifier. In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is proved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional distributions, measured in terms of an IPM."

Starting point is the Gromov-Wasserstein Distance which is successfully applied in shape recognition and classification tasks but involves solving a non-convex optimization problem and which is non-convex as a function of the involved shape representations. In two steps we derive a convex approximation which takes the form of a modified transport problem and inherits the ability to incorporate vast classes of geometric invariances beyond rigid isometries. We propose ways to counterbalance the loss of descriptiveness induced by the required approximations and to process additional (non-geometric) feature information. We demonstrate combination with a linear appearance term and show that the resulting functional can be minimized by standard linear programming methods and yields a bijective registration between a given template shape and the segmented foreground image region. Key aspects of the approach are illustrated by numerical experiments."

We prove uniqueness of the barycenter of a population of GPs, as well as convergence of the metric and the barycenter of their finite-dimensional counterparts. This justifies practical computations. Finally, we demonstrate our framework through experimental validation on GP datasets representing brain connectivity and climate development.

We use the Wasserstein distance to construct a ball in the space of probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples. If the radius of this ball is chosen judiciously, we can guarantee that it contains the unknown data-generating distribution with high confidence. We then formulate a distribution-ally robust logistic regression model that minimizes a worst-case expected logloss function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein ball. We prove that this optimization problem admits a tractable reformulation and encapsulates the classical as well as the popular regularized logistic regression problems as special cases. We further propose a distributionally robust approach based on Wasserstein balls to compute upper and lower confidence bounds on the misclassification probability of the resulting classifier. These bounds are given by the optimal values of two highly tractable linear programs. We validate our theoretical out-of-sample guarantees through simulated and empirical experiments."

By combining graduated nonconvexity, two-way (assignment) constraints, and sparsity, large improvements in accuracy and speed are achieved. Its low order computational complexity [O(lm), where l and m are the number of links in the two graphs] and robustness in the presence of noise offer advantages over traditional combinatorial approaches. The algorithm, not restricted to any special class of graph, is applied to subgraph isomorphism, weighted graph matching, and attributed relational graph matching. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, attributed relational graphs derived from objects are matched. Then, results from twenty-five thousand experiments conducted on 100 mode random graphs of varying types (graphs with only zero-one links, weighted graphs, and graphs with node attributes and multiple link types) are reported. No comparable results have been reported by any other graph matching algorithm before in the research literature. Twenty-five hundred control experiments are conducted using a relaxation labeling algorithm and large improvements in accuracy are demonstrated."

We present a novel linear time algorithm for approximating the EMD for low dimensional histograms using the sum of absolute values of the weighted wavelet coefficients of the difference histogram. EMD computation is a special case of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transshipment problem, and we exploit the Holder continuity constraint in its dual form to convert it into a simple optimization problem with an explicit solution in the wavelet domain. We prove that the resulting wavelet EMD metric is equivalent to EMD, i.e. the ratio of the two is bounded. We also provide estimates for the bounds. The weighted wavelet transform can be computed in time linear in the number of histogram bins, while the comparison is about as fast as for normal Euclidean distance or chi2 statistic. We experimentally show that wavelet EMD is a good approximation to EMD, has similar performance, but requires much less computation."

Our test statistic is the largest difference in expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and is called the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).We present two distribution free tests based on large deviation bounds for the MMD, and a third test based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS. We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests."

We detail two classes of Gaussian processes parameterized by a small number of compactly supported linear filters, the so-called textons. The first class extends the spot noise (SN) texture model to the dynamical setting. We estimate the space-time texton to fit a translation-invariant covariance from an input exemplar. The second class is a specialization of the auto-regressive (AR) dynamic texture method to the setting of space and time stationary textures. This allows one to parameterize the covariance with only a few spatial textons. The simplicity of these models allows us to tackle a more complex problem, texture mixing which, in our case, amounts to interpolate between Gaussian models. We use optimal transport to derive geodesic paths and barycenters between the models learned from an input data set. This allows the user to navigate inside the set of texture models and perform texture synthesis from each new interpolated model. Numerical results on a library of exemplars show the ability of our method to generate arbitrary interpolations among unstructured natural textures. Moreover, experiments on a database of stationary textures show that the methods, despite their simplicity, provide state of the art results on stationary dynamical texture synthesis and mixing."

We consider the problem of computing a transformation of one distribution which minimizes its EMD to another. The applications discussed here include estimation of the size at which a color pattern occurs in an image, lighting-invariant object recognition, and point feature matching in stereo image pairs. We present a monotonically convergent iteration which can be applied to a large class of EMD under transformation problems, although the iteration may converge to only a locally optimal transformation. We also provide algorithms that are guaranteed to compute a globally optimal transformation for a few specific problems, including some EMD under translation problems."

It provides a distance value as well as a flow-network indicating how the probability mass is optimally transported between the bins. In traditional EMD, the ground distance between the bins is pre-defined. Instead, we propose to jointly optimize the ground distance matrix and the EMD flow-network based on a partial ordering of histogram distances in an optimization framework. Our method is further extended to accept information from general labeled pairs. The trained ground distance better reflects the cross-bin relationships, hence produces more accurate EMD values and flow-networks. Two computer vision applications are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm: first, we apply the optimized EMD value to face verification, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the PubFig and the LFW data sets; second, the learned EMD flow-network is used to analyze face attribute changes, obtaining consistent paths that demonstrate intuitive transitions on certain facial attributes."

However, it is well known that in a multi-resolution context, where the need for large filters is required, this technique suffers from the fact it is a computationally expensive since the number of operations per point in convolving an image with a Gaussian filter is directly proportional to the width of the operator. We propose in this paper a technique in order to use Gaussian filtering with a reduced and fixed number of operations per output independently of the size of the filter. The key of our approach is to approximate in a mean square sense the prototype Gaussian filters with an exponentially based filter family depending on the same scale factor than the Gaussian filters (i.e. s) and then to implement in an exact and recursive way the approximate filters. An important point of the design presented in this paper is that dealing with Gaussian filters having different scale factor (i.e. s) will not require a new design algorithm as. The coefficients looked for in the recursive realization are determined function of the scale factor of each considered prototype filter, namely the Gaussian filter, its first and second derivative. Some experimental results will be shown to illustrate the efficiency of the approximation process and some applications to edge detection problems and multi-resolution techniques will be considered and discussed."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

In all of our problems, one is given a collimated or point light source and a desired illumination after reflection or refraction and the goal is to design the geometry of a mirror or lens which transports exactly the light emitted by the source onto the target. We first propose a general framework and show that eight different optical component design problems amount to solving a Light Energy Conservation equation that involves the computation of Visibility diagrams. We show that these diagrams all have the same structure and can be obtained by intersecting a 3D Power Diagram with a planar or spherical domain. This allows us to propose an efficient and fully generic algorithm capable to solve the eight optical component design problems. Our solutions can satisfy design constraints such as convexity or concavity and are always graphs over the plane or the sphere. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm on numerous simulated examples."

The power diagram of a finite set S of spheres in $E^d $ is a cell complex that associates each $s \\in S$ with the convex domain $\\{ x \\in E^d | {\\operatorname{pow}} (x,s) < {\\operatorname{pow}} (x,t), {\\text{ for all }} t \\in S - \\{ s\\} \\}$.The close relationship to convex hulls and arrangements of hyperplanes is investigated and exploited. Efficient algorithms that compute the power diagram and its order-k modifications are obtained. Among the applications of these results are algorithms for detecting k-sets, for union and intersection problems for cones and paraboloids, and for constructing weighted Voronoi diagrams and Voronoi diagrams for spheres. Upper space bounds for these geometric problems are derived."

                "text": "Theano is a Python library that allows to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Since its introduction, it has been one of the most used CPU and GPU mathematical compilers - especially in the machine learning community - and has shown steady performance improvements. Theano is being actively and continuously developed since 2008, multiple frameworks have been built on top of it and it has been used to produce many state-of-the-art machine learning models. \nThe present article is structured as follows. Section I provides an overview of the Theano software and its community. Section II presents the principal features of Theano and how to use them, and compares them with other similar projects. Section III focuses on recently-introduced functionalities and improvements. Section IV compares the performance of Theano against Torch7 and TensorFlow on several machine learning models. Section V discusses current limitations of Theano and potential ways of improving it."

Parameters of the model are usually learned by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from training samples to the learned model. We propose in this work a novel approach for Boltzmann machine training which assumes that a meaningful metric between observations is known. This metric between observations can then be used to define the Wasserstein distance between the distribution induced by the Boltzmann machine on the one hand, and that given by the training sample on the other hand. We derive a gradient of that distance with respect to the model parameters. Minimization of this new objective leads to generative models with different statistical properties. We demonstrate their practical potential on data completion and denoising, for which the metric between observations plays a crucial role."

Therefore, applications of Douglas\u2014Rachford splitting, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming decomposition, are also special cases of the proximal point algorithm. This observation allows the unification and generalization of a variety of convex programming algorithms. By introducing a modified version of the proximal point algorithm, we derive a new,generalized alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming. Advances of this sort illustrate the power and generality gained by adopting monotone operator theory as a conceptual framework."

                "text": "The classical Fokker\u2013Planck equation is a linear parabolic equation which describes the time evolution of the probability distribution of a stochastic process defined on a Euclidean space. Corresponding to a stochastic process, there often exists a free energy functional which is defined on the space of probability distributions and is a linear combination of a potential and an entropy. In recent years, it has been shown that the Fokker\u2013Planck equation is the gradient flow of the free energy functional defined on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions whose inner product is generated by a 2-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we consider analogous matters for a free energy functional or Markov process defined on a graph with a finite number of vertices and edges. If N \u2267\u00a02 is the number of vertices of the graph, we show that the corresponding Fokker\u2013Planck equation is a system of Nnonlinear ordinary differential equations defined on a Riemannian manifold of probability distributions. However, in contrast to stochastic processes defined on Euclidean spaces, the situation is more subtle for discrete spaces. We have different choices for inner products on the space of probability distributions resulting in different Fokker\u2013Planck equations for the same process. It is shown that there is a strong connection but there are also substantial discrepancies between the systems of ordinary differential equations and the classical Fokker\u2013Planck equation on Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, both systems of ordinary differential equations are gradient flows for the same free energy functional defined on the Riemannian manifolds of probability distributions with different metrics. Some examples are also discussed."

Yet computing an average of brain imaging data defined over a voxel grid or a triangulation remains a challenge. Data are large, the geometry of the brain is complex and the between subjects variability leads to spatially or temporally non-overlapping effects of interest. To address the problem of variability, data are commonly smoothed before performing a linear group averaging. In this work we build on ideas originally introduced by Kantorovich to propose a new algorithm that can average efficiently non-normalized data defined over arbitrary discrete domains using transportation metrics. We show how Kantorovich means can be linked to Wasserstein barycenters in order to take advantage of the entropic smoothing approach used by. It leads to a smooth convex optimization problem and an algorithm with strong convergence guarantees. We illustrate the versatility of this tool and its empirical behavior on functional neuroimaging data, functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source estimates, defined on voxel grids and triangulations of the folded cortical surface."

The amplitude variation of a real random function $\\{Y(x):x\\in[0,1]\\}$ corresponds to its random oscillations in the $y$-axis, typically encapsulated by its (co)variation around a mean level. In contrast, its phase variation refers to fluctuations in the $x$-axis, often caused by random time changes. We formalise similar notions for a point process, and nonparametrically separate them based on realisations of i.i.d. copies $\\{\\Pi_i\\}$ of the phase-varying point process. A key element in our approach is to demonstrate that when the classical phase variation assumptions of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) are applied to the point process case, they become equivalent to conditions interpretable through the prism of the theory of optimal transportation of measure. We demonstrate that these induce a natural Wasserstein geometry tailored to the warping problem, including a formal notion of bias expressing over-registration. Within this framework, we construct nonparametric estimators that tend to avoid over-registration in finite samples. We show that they consistently estimate the warp maps, consistently estimate the structural mean, and consistently register the warped point processes, even in a sparse sampling regime. We also establish convergence rates, and derive $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and a central limit theorem in the Cox process case under dense sampling, showing rate optimality of our structural mean estimator in that case."

This generalizes a fundamental process of matrix balancing used to compare matrices in a wide range of applications from biology to economics. We present an efficient balancing algorithm with quadratic convergence using Newton's method and show in numerical experiments that the proposed algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than existing ones. To theoretically prove the correctness of the algorithm, we model tensors as probability distributions in a statistical manifold and realize tensor balancing as projection onto a submanifold. The key to our algorithm is that the gradient of the manifold, used as a Jacobian matrix in Newton's method, can be analytically obtained using the Moebius inversion formula, the essential of combinatorial mathematics. Our model is not limited to tensor balancing, but has a wide applicability as it includes various statistical and machine learning models such as weighted DAGs and Boltzmann machines."

We propose in this work an extension of that approach, which consists in embedding objects as elliptical probability distributions, namely distributions whose densities have elliptical level sets. We endow these measures with the 2-Wasserstein metric, with two important benefits: (i) For such measures, the squared 2-Wasserstein metric has a closed form, equal to a weighted sum of the squared Euclidean distance between means and the squared Bures metric between covariance matrices. The latter is a Riemannian metric between positive semi-definite matrices, which turns out to be Euclidean on a suitable factor representation of such matrices, which is valid on the entire geodesic between these matrices. (ii) The 2-Wasserstein distance boils down to the usual Euclidean metric when comparing Diracs, and therefore provides a natural framework to extend point embeddings. We show that for these reasons Wasserstein elliptical embeddings are more intuitive and yield tools that are better behaved numerically than the alternative choice of Gaussian embeddings with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In particular, and unlike previous work based on the KL geometry, we learn elliptical distributions that are not necessarily diagonal. We demonstrate the advantages of elliptical embeddings by using them for visualization, to compute embeddings of words, and to reflect entailment or hypernymy."

Visual responses change depending on the proximity to the photomosaic, leading to many creative prospects for publicity and art. Synthesizing photomosaics typically requires very large image databases in order to produce pleasing results. Moreover, repetitions are allowed to occur which may locally bias the mosaic. This paper provides alternatives to prevent repetitions while still being robust enough to work with coarse image subsets. Three approaches were considered for the matching stage of photomosaics: a greedy-based procedural algorithm, simulated annealing and SoftAssign. It was found that the latter delivers adequate arrangements in cases where only a restricted number of images is available. This paper introduces a novel GPU-accelerated SoftAssign implementation that outperforms an optimized CPU implementation by a factor of 60 times in the tested hardware."

Under weak regularity assumptions on the kernels defining the semigroup, we derive simple characterizations of the H\u00f6lder\u2013Lipschitz norm and its dual with respect to these distances. As the dual norm of the difference of two probability measures is the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) between these measures, our characterizations give simple formulas for a metric equivalent to EMD. We extend these results to the mixed H\u00f6lder\u2013Lipschitz norm and its dual on the product of spaces, each of which is equipped with its own semigroup. Additionally, we derive an approximation theorem for mixed Lipschitz functions in this setting."

Using the Wasserstein metric, we construct a ball in the space of (multivariate and non-discrete) probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples, and we seek decisions that perform best in view of the worst-case distribution within this Wasserstein ball. The state-of-the-art methods for solving the resulting distributionally robust optimization problems rely on global optimization techniques, which quickly become computationally excruciating. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the distributionally robust optimization problems over Wasserstein balls can in fact be reformulated as finite convex programs\u2014in many interesting cases even as tractable linear programs. Leveraging recent measure concentration results, we also show that their solutions enjoy powerful finite-sample performance guarantees. Our theoretical results are exemplified in mean-risk portfolio optimization as well as uncertainty quantification."

In this paper, we exploit the widely used kernel methods and provide a family of provably positive definite kernels based on the Sliced Wasserstein distance and demonstrate the benefits of these kernels in a variety of learning tasks.

In the particular case of discrete distributions (weighted sums of Dirac measures), we provide a new algorithm to compare two arbitrary unlabelled sets of points, and show that it behaves properly in limit of continuous distributions on sub-manifolds. As a consequence, the algorithm may apply to various matching problems, such as curve or surface matching (via a sub-sampling), or mixings of landmark and curve data. As the solution forbids high energy solutions, it is also robust towards addition of noise and the technique can be used for nonlinear projection of datasets. We present 2D and 3D experiments."

With the increasing\npopularity and very broad applications of this source\nof data, it is natural and important to work directly with this\nrepresentation, without having to go through the intermediate and\nsometimes impossible and distorting steps of surface reconstruction.\nA geometric framework for comparing manifolds given by point clouds\nis presented in this paper.

As an example, it was recently shown that it is possible to infer a bilingual lexicon, without supervised data, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data. These recent advances are based on adversarial training to learn the mapping between the two embeddings. In this paper, we propose to use an alternative formulation, based on the joint estimation of an orthogonal matrix and a permutation matrix. While this problem is not convex, we propose to initialize our optimization algorithm by using a convex relaxation, traditionally considered for the graph isomorphism problem. We propose a stochastic algorithm to minimize our cost function on large scale problems. Finally, we evaluate our method on the problem of unsupervised word translation, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data. On this task, our method obtains state of the art results, while requiring less computational resources than competing approaches."

Censor and Reich very recently suggested a synthesis of these methods, Dykstra\u2019s algorithm with Bregman projections, to tackle a non-orthogonal best approximation problem, They obtained convergence when each constraint is a halfspace. It is shown here that this new algorithm works for general closed convex constraints; this complements Censor and Reich\u2019s result and relates to a framework by Tseng. The proof rests on Boyle and Dykstra\u2019s original work and on strong properties of Bregman distances corresponding to Legendre functions. Special cases and observations simplifying the implementation of the algorithm are aiso discussed"

We introduce an appropriate linearization of the optimal \ntransport problem, which leads to a mixed symmetric formulation. \nThis formulation preserves the maximum principle in case of the \nsemi-discrete scheme as well as the fully discrete scheme for a \ncertain class of problems. In addition solutions of the mixed \nformulation maintain exponential convergence in the relative \nentropy towards the steady state in case of a nonlinear \nFokker-Planck equation with uniformly convex potential. We \ndemonstrate the behavior of the proposed scheme with 2D \nsimulations of the porous medium equations and blow-up questions \nin the Patlak-Keller-Segel model."

                "text": "We propose and analyze a nonparametric region-based active contour model for segmenting cluttered scenes. The proposed model is unsupervised and assumes pixel intensity is independently identically distributed. Our proposed energy functional consists of a geometric regularization term that penalizes the length of the partition boundaries and a region-based image term that uses histograms of pixel intensity to distinguish different regions. More specifically, the region data encourages segmentation so that local histograms within each region are approximately homogeneous. An advantage of using local histograms in the data term is that histogram differentiation is not required to solve the energy minimization problem. We use Wasserstein distance with exponent 1 to determine the dissimilarity between two histograms. The Wasserstein distance is a metric and is able to faithfully measure the distance between two histograms, compared to many pointwise distances. Moreover, it is insensitive to oscillations, and therefore our model is robust to noise. A\u00a0fast global minimization method based on (Chan et al. in SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(5):1632\u20131648, 2006; Bresson et al. in J. Math. Imaging Vis. 28(2):151\u2013167, 2007) is employed to solve the proposed model. The advantages of using this method are two-fold. First, the computational time is less than that of the method by gradient descent of the associated Euler-Lagrange equation (Chan et al. in Proc. of SSVM, pp.\u00a0697\u2013708, 2007). Second, it is able to find a global minimizer. Finally, we propose a variant of our model that is able to properly segment a cluttered scene with local illumination changes."

It contains the squared Hellinger distance (for \u03b2=1/2), the sumI(Q1\u2016(Q1+Q2)/2)+I(Q2\u2016(Q1+Q2)/2) of Kullback-Leibler divergences (for \u03b2=1) and half of the variation distance (for \u03b2=\u221e) and continuously extends the class of squared perimeter-type distances introduced by \u00d6sterreicher (1996,Kybernetika,32, 389\u2013393) (for \u03b2\u03b5 (1, \u221e]). It is shown that\n$$(I_{f_\\beta } (Q_1 ,Q_2 ))^{\\min (\\beta ,1/2)}$$\n are distances of probability distributionsQ1,Q2 for \u03b2 \u03b5 (0, \u221e). The applicability of\n$$I_{f_\\beta }$$\n-divergences in statistics is also considered. In particular, it is shown that the\n$$I_{f_\\beta }$$\n-projections of appropriate empirical distributions to regular families define distribution estimates which are in the case of an i.i.d. sample of size'n consistent. The order of consistency is investigated as well."

Solutions can be singular, in which case standard numerical approaches fail. Novel solution methods are required for stability and convergence to the weak (viscosity) solution. In this article we build a wide stencil finite difference discretization for the Monge-Ampere equation. The scheme is monotone, so the Barles-Souganidis theory allows us to prove that the solution of the scheme converges to the unique viscosity solution of the equation. Solutions of the scheme are found using a damped Newton's method. We prove convergence of Newton's method and provide a systematic method to determine a starting point for the Newton iteration. Computational results are presented in two and three dimensions, which demonstrates the speed and accuracy of the method on a number of exact solutions, which range in regularity from smooth to nondifferentiable."

                "text": "Nuclear morphology and structure as visualized from histopathology microscopy images can yield important diagnostic clues in some benign and malignant tissue lesions. Precise quantitative information about nuclear structure and morphology, however, is currently not available for many diagnostic challenges. This is due, in part, to the lack of methods to quantify these differences from image data. We describe a method to characterize and contrast the distribution of nuclear structure in different tissue classes (normal, benign, cancer, etc.). The approach is based on quantifying chromatin morphology in different groups of cells using the optimal transportation (Kantorovich-Wasserstein) metric in combination with the Fisher discriminant analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques. We show that the optimal transportation metric is able to measure relevant biological information as it enables automatic determination of the class (e.g., normal versus cancer) of a set of nuclei. We show that the classification accuracies obtained using this metric are, on average, as good or better than those obtained utilizing a set of previously described numerical features. We apply our methods to two diagnostic challenges for surgical pathology: one in the liver and one in the thyroid. Results automatically computed using this technique show potentially biologically relevant differences in nuclear structure in liver and thyroid cancers."

The financial market is modeled through a risky asset whose price is only assumed to be a continuous function of time. The hedging problem is to construct a minimal super-hedging portfolio that consists of dynamically trading the underlying risky asset and a static position of vanilla options which can be exercised at the given, fixed maturity. The dual is a Monge\u2013Kantorovich type martingale transport problem of maximizing the expected value of the option over all martingale measures that have a given marginal at maturity. In addition to duality, a family of simple, piecewise constant super-replication portfolios that asymptotically achieve the minimal super-replication cost is constructed."

To speed-up the computation and be able to handle high-dimensional features and large-scale data, we introduce an approximation of the differential of the Wasserstein distance between histograms. The framework is flexible enough to allow either minimization of the Wasserstein distance to prior distributions, or maximization of the distance between the distributions of the regions to be segmented (i.e. region competition). Numerical results reported demonstrate the advantages of the proposed optimal transport distance with respect to point-wise metrics."

The general theory of path-following and potential reduction interior point polynomial time methods, interior point methods, interior point methods for linear and quadratic programming, polynomial time methods for nonlinear convex programming, efficient computation methods for control problems and variational inequalities, and acceleration of path-following methods are covered. In this book, the authors describe the first unified theory of polynomial-time interior-point methods. Their approach provides a simple and elegant framework in which all known polynomial-time interior-point methods can be explained and analyzed; this approach yields polynomial-time interior-point methods for a wide variety of problems beyond the traditional linear and quadratic programs. The book contains new and important results in the general theory of convex programming, e.g., their \"conic\" problem formulation in which duality theory is completely symmetric. For each algorithm described, the authors carefully derive precise bounds on the computational effort required to solve a given family of problems to a given precision. In several cases they obtain better problem complexity estimates than were previously known. Several of the new algorithms described in this book, e.g., the projective method, have been implemented, tested on \"real world\" problems, and found to be extremely efficient in practice.

Our method involves a joint optimization formulation over several spaces of discrete probability measures, which are endowed with Wasserstein distance metrics. We propose a number of variants of this problem, which admit fast optimization algorithms, by exploiting the connection to the problem of finding Wasserstein barycenters. Consistency properties are established for the estimates of both local and global clusters. Finally, experiment results with both synthetic and real data are presented to demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed approach."

Our main contribution is in building a norm on the space of surfaces via representation by currents of geometric measure theory. Currents are an appropriate choice for representations because they inherit natural transformation properties from differential forms. We impose a Hilbert space structure on currents, whose norm gives a convenient and practical way to define a matching functional. Using this Hilbert space norm, we also derive and implement a surface matching algorithm under the large deformation framework, guaranteeing that the optimal solution is a one-to-one regular map of the entire ambient space. We detail an implementation of this algorithm for triangular meshes and present results on 3D face and medical image data."

This problem can be tackled using non-negative matrix factorization approaches, using typically Euclidean or Kullback-Leibler fitting errors. Because these fitting errors are separable and treat each feature on equal footing, they are blind to any similarity the features may share. We assume in this work that we have prior knowledge on these features. To leverage this side-information, we propose to use the Wasserstein (a.k.a. earth mover\u2019s or optimal transport) distance as the fitting error between each original point and its reconstruction, and we propose scalable algorithms to to so. Our methods build upon Fenchel duality and entropic regularization of Wasserstein distances, which improves not only speed but also computational stability. We apply these techniques on face images and text documents.

The similarity measure is a key object in diffeomorphic registration methods that, together with the regularization on the deformation, defines the optimal deformation. Most often, these similarity measures are local or non local but simple enough to be computationally fast. We build on recent theoretical and numerical advances in optimal transport to propose fast and global similarity measures that can be used on surfaces or volumetric imaging data. This new similarity measure is computed using a fast generalized Sinkhorn algorithm. We apply this new metric in the LDDMM framework on synthetic and real data, fibres bundles and surfaces and show that better matching results are obtained."

For scalar time-series several notions of distance (divergences) have been proposed and studied starting from the early 1970s while multivariable ones have only recently began to receive any attention. In the paper, two classes of divergence measures inspired by classical prediction theory are introduced. These divergences naturally induce Riemannian metrics on the cone of multivariable densities. The metrics amount to the quadratic term in the divergence between \u201cinfinitesimally close to each other\u201d power spectra. For one of the two we provide explicit formulae for the corresponding geodesics and geodesic distance. A close connection between the geometry of power spectra and the geometry of the Fisher-Rao metric is noted."

                "text": "Recently, a new document metric called the word mover's distance (WMD) has been proposed with unprecedented results on kNN-based document classification. The WMD elevates high-quality word embeddings to a document metric by formulating the distance between two documents as an optimal transport problem between the embedded words. However, the document distances are entirely un-supervised and lack a mechanism to incorporate supervision when available. In this paper we propose an efficient technique to learn a supervised metric, which we call the Supervised-WMD (S-WMD) metric. The supervised training minimizes the stochastic leave-one-out nearest neighbor classification error on a per-document level by updating an affine transformation of the underlying word embedding space and a word-imporance weight vector. As the gradient of the original WMD distance would result in an inefficient nested optimization problem, we provide an arbitrarily close approximation that results in a practical and efficient update rule. We evaluate S-WMD on eight real-world text classification tasks on which it consistently outperforms almost all of our 26 competitive baselines."

The TEMD is a generalization of the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) that is invariant to some global transformations. Thus, like the EMD it is robust to local deformations. Additionally, it is robuster to global transformations such as global translations and rotations of the whole image. The TEMD is formulated as a linear program which allows efficient computation. Additionally, previous works about the efficient computation of the EMD that reduced the number of variables in the EMD linear program can be used to accelerate also the TEMD computation. We present results for image retrieval using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and color image descriptors. We show that the new TEMD outperforms state of the art distances."

The discretization is based on the equation\u2019s gradient flow structure in the $$L^2$$L2-Wasserstein metric. By construction, the discrete solutions are strictly positive and mass conserving. A further key property is that they dissipate both the Fisher information and the logarithmic entropy. Our main result is a proof of convergence of fully discrete to weak solutions in the limit of vanishing mesh size. Convergence is obtained for arbitrary nonnegative, possibly discontinuous initial data with finite entropy, without any CFL-type condition. The key estimates in the proof are derived from the dissipations of the two Lyapunov functionals. Numerical experiments illustrate the practicability of the scheme."

To overcome this obstacle, for probability measures supported on finitely many points, we derive the asymptotic distribution of empirical Wasserstein distances as the optimal value of a linear programme with random objective function. This facilitates statistical inference (e.g. confidence intervals for sample\u2010based Wasserstein distances) in large generality. Our proof is based on directional Hadamard differentiability. Failure of the classical bootstrap and alternatives are discussed. The utility of the distributional results is illustrated on two data sets."

Given their ability to provide accurate generative models for signal intensities and other data distributions, they have been used in a variety of applications, including content-based retrieval, cancer detection, image superresolution, and statistical machine learning, to name a few, and they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results. Moreover, the geometric characteristics of transport-related metrics have inspired new kinds of algorithms for interpreting the meaning of data distributions. Here, we provide a practical overview of the mathematical underpinnings of mass transport-related methods, including numerical implementation, as well as a review, with demonstrations, of several applications. Software accompanying this article is available from [43]."

Metric Learning: A Review presents an overview of existing research in this topic, including recent progress on scaling to high-dimensional feature spaces and to data sets with an extremely large number of data points. It presents as unified a framework as possible under which existing research on metric learning can be cast. The monograph starts out by focusing on linear metric learning approaches, and mainly concentrates on the class of Mahalanobis distance learning methods. It then discusses nonlinear metric learning approaches, focusing on the connections between the non-linear and linear approaches. Finally, it discusses extensions of metric learning, as well as applications to a variety of problems in computer vision, text analysis, program analysis, and multimedia. Metric Learning: A Review is an ideal reference for anyone interested in the metric learning problem. It synthesizes much of the recent work in the area and it is hoped that it will inspire new algorithms and applications."

The empirical distributions of linear or nonlinear image descriptors are imposed to be close to some input distributions by minimizing a Wasserstein loss, i.e., the optimal transport distance between the distributions. We advocate the use of a Wasserstein distance because it is robust when using discrete distributions without the need to resort to kernel estimators. We showcase the use of different descriptors to tackle various image processing applications. These descriptors include linear wavelet-based filtering to account for simple textures, nonlinear sparse coding coefficients for more complicated patterns, and the image gradient to restore sharper contents. For applications to texture synthesis, the input distributions are the empirical distributions compu..."

A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org."

Several consistent tests for comparing multivariate distributions can be developed from the underlying theoretical results. The test procedure for the multisample problem is developed and applied for testing the composite hypothesis of equal distributions, when distributions are unspecified. The proposed test is universally consistent against all fixed alternatives (not necessarily continuous) with finite second moments. The test is implemented by conditioning on the pooled sample to obtain an approximate permutation test, which is distribution free. Our Monte Carlo power study suggests that the new test may be much more sensitive than tests based on nearest neighbors against several classes of alternatives, and performs particularly well in high dimension. Computational complexity of our test procedure is independent of dimension and number of populations sampled. The test is applied in a high dimensional problem, testing microarray data from cancer samples."

We prove existence of a minimizer for a class of variational problems based on this formulation of total variation and provide an example where uniqueness fails to hold. Employing the Kantorovich\u2013Rubinstein transport norm from the theory of optimal transport, we propose a variational approach for the restoration of orientation distribution function-valued images, as commonly used in diffusion MRI.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to achieve the balancing, the most well known of these being Sinkhorn-Knopp. In this paper we derive new algorithms based on inner-outer iteration schemes. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp belongs to this family, but other members can converge much more quickly. In particular, we show that while stationary iterative methods offer little or no improvement in many cases, a scheme using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method as the inner iteration can give quadratic convergence at low cost."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

Classical optimal transport theory specifies the matching affinity and determines the optimal joint distribution. In contrast, we study the inverse problem of estimating matching affinity based on the observation of the joint distribution, using an entropic regularization of the problem. To accommodate high dimensionality of the data, we propose a novel method that incorporates a nuclear norm regularization which effectively enforces a rank constraint on the affinity matrix. The low-rank matrix estimated in this way reveals the main factors which are relevant for matching."

The first method makes use of the Radon transform of the measures, and the second is the solution of a convex optimization problem over the space of measures. We show several properties of these barycenters and explain their relationship. We show numerical approximation schemes based on a discrete Radon transform and on the resolution of a non-convex optimization problem. We explore the respective merits and drawbacks of each approach on applications to two image processing problems: color transfer and texture mixing."

This algebra arises in quantum mechanics as the algebra of observables generated by n fermionic degrees of freedom. Let $${\\mathfrak{P}}$$P denote the set of all positive operators $${\\rho\\in\\mathfrak{C}}$$\u03c1\u2208C such that \u03c4(\u03c1) =\u00a01; these are the non-commutative analogs of probability densities in the non-commutative probability space $${(\\mathfrak{C},\\tau)}$$(C,\u03c4). The fermionic Fokker\u2013Planck equation is a quantum-mechanical analog of the classical Fokker\u2013Planck equation with which it has much in common, such as the same optimal hypercontractivity properties. In this paper we construct a Riemannian metric on $${\\mathfrak{P}}$$P that we show to be a natural analog of the classical 2-Wasserstein metric, and we show that, in analogy with the classical case, the fermionic Fokker\u2013Planck equation is gradient flow in this metric for the relative entropy with respect to the ground state. We derive a number of consequences of this, such as a sharp Talagrand inequality for this metric, and we prove a number of results pertaining to this metric. Several open problems are raised."

They also allow to prove an interesting structural result for distributions with multivariate marginals, to prove existence results for optimal approximations in additive statistical models, and to give an extension of Kolmogorov's representation theorem for continuous functions of severalvariables.

We prove that for every $\\varepsilon>0$, every $\\theta\\in (0,1/p]$ and every finite metric space $(X,d_X)$, the metric space $(X,d_{X}^{\\theta})$ embeds into $\\mathscr{P}_p(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ with distortion at most $1+\\varepsilon$. We show that this is sharp when $p\\in (1,2]$ in the sense that the exponent $1/p$ cannot be replaced by any larger number. In fact, for arbitrarily large $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exists an $n$-point metric space $(X_n,d_n)$ such that for every $\\alpha\\in (1/p,1]$ any embedding of the metric space $(X_n,d_n^\\alpha)$ into $\\mathscr{P}_p(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ incurs distortion that is at least a constant multiple of $(\\log n)^{\\alpha-1/p}$. These statements establish that there exists an Alexandrov space of nonnegative curvature, namely $\\mathscr{P}_{\\! 2}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$, with respect to which there does not exist a sequence of bounded degree expander graphs. It also follows that $\\mathscr{P}_{\\! 2}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ does not admit a uniform, coarse, or quasisymmetric embedding into any Banach space of nontrivial type. Links to several longstanding open questions in metric geometry are discussed, including the characterization of subsets of Alexandrov spaces, existence of expanders, the universality problem for $\\mathscr{P}_{\\! 2}(\\mathbb{R}^k)$, and the metric cotype dichotomy problem."

Moreover, its completion as a metric space provides a complete picture of the singular behavior of the L 2 Wasserstein geometry. In particular, the singular set is st ratified according to the dimension of the support of the Gaussian measures, providing an explicit nontrivial example of Alexandrov space with extremal sets."

We develop novel connections between such Monte Carlo algorithms, the theory of Wasserstein gradient flow, and the operator splitting approach to solving PDEs. In particular, we show that a proximal version of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm corresponds to a scheme that alternates between solving the gradient flows of two specific functionals on the space of probability measures. Using this perspective, we derive some new non-asymptotic results on the convergence properties of this algorithm."

The algorithm transforms the flow-network of the EMD so that the number of edges is reduced by an order of magnitude. As a result, we compute the EMD by an order of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, which makes it possible to compute the EMD on large histograms and databases. In addition, we show that EMDs with thresholded ground distances have many desirable properties. First, they correspond to the way humans perceive distances. Second, they are robust to outlier noise and quantization effects. Third, they are metrics. Finally, experimental results on image retrieval show that thresholding the ground distance of the EMD improves both accuracy and speed."

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner."

Here, we introduce an approach, WADDINGTON-OT, based on the mathematics of optimal transport, for inferring developmental landscapes, probabilistic cellular fates and dynamic trajectories from large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected along a time course. We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neuraland placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation."

Without proper education MRP II and JIT=TQC will not be successful and will not generate their true bene\u00aets. Suppliers are key to the success of MRP II and JIT=TQC. They therefore need to understand these disciplines. Purchasing in the 21st century is going to be marked by continuous changes, by who can gain the competitive edge \u00aerst, who will be the most \u0304exible and who will build the best supplier relationships. This will only be achieved by following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark, ignite change'! Only then can it happen! If you really want to know something about purchasing then this is the book to read. It is most de\u00aenitely relevant and more importantly up to date. It will certainly be a handy reference book for a course on purchasing."

First, point clouds sampled from manifolds originally embedded in some Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^D$ are transformed to new point clouds embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by Laplace-Beltrami(LB) eigenmap using the $n$ leading eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of LB operator defined intrinsically on the manifolds. The LB eigenmap are invariant under isometric transformation of the original manifolds. Then we design computational models and algorithms for registration of the transformed point clouds in distribution/probability form based on the optimal transport theory which provides both generality and flexibility to handle general point clouds setting. Our methods use robust sliced-Wasserstein distance, which is as the average of projected Wasserstein distance along different directions, and incorporate a rigid transformation to handle ambiguities introduced by the Laplace-Beltrami eigenmap. By going from smaller $n$, which provides a quick and robust registration (based on coarse scale features) as well as a good initial guess for finer scale registration, to a larger $n$, our method provides an efficient, robust and accurate approach for multi-scale non-rigid point cloud registration."

The formulation, based on the Wasserstein distance, allows modelling of local object appearance, statistical shape variations and geometric invariance in a uniform way. For learning of class typical shape variations we adopt a recently presented approach and extend it to support inference of deformations during segmentation of new query images. The resulting way of describing and fitting trained shape variations is in style reminiscent of contour-based variational shape priors, but does not require an intricate conversion between the contour and the region representation of shapes. A well-founded hierarchical branch-and-bound scheme, based on local adaptive convex relaxation, is presented, that provably finds the global minimum of the functional."

The surplus from a marriage match, for instance, may depend both on the incomes and on the educations of the partners, as well as on characteristics that the analyst does not observe. The social optimum must therefore trade off matching on incomes and matching on educations. Given a exible specification of the surplus function, we characterize under mild assumptions the properties of the set of feasible matchings and of the socially optimal matching. Then we show how data on the covariation of the types of the partners in observed matches can be used to estimate the parameters that define social preferences over matches. We provide both nonparametric and parametric procedures that are very easy to use in applications."

The new framework features a new way to construct uncertainty sets under the null and the alternative distributions, which are sets centered around the empirical distribution defined via Wasserstein metric, thus our approach is data-driven and free of distributional assumptions. We develop a convex safe approximation of the minimax formulation and show that such approximation renders a nearly-optimal detector among the family of all possible tests. By exploiting the structure of the least favorable distribution, we also develop a tractable reformulation of such approximation, with complexity independent of the dimension of observation space and can be nearly sample-size-independent in general. Real-data example using human activity data demonstrated the excellent performance of the new robust detector."

In this paper, a new class of image morphing algorithms is proposed based on the theory of optimal mass transport.

It is an intensity-based approach and, thus, is parameter free. The optimal warping function is computed using an iterative gradient descent approach.

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to \"travel\" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates."

It is common practice to use the L 2 metric for comparing SIFT descriptors. This practice assumes that SIFT bins are aligned, an assumption which is often not correct due to quantization, distortion, occlusion etc. \n \nIn this paper we present a new Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) variant. We show that it is a metric (unlike the original EMD [1] which is a metric only for normalized histograms). Moreover, it is a natural extension of the L 1 metric. Second, we propose a linear time algorithm for the computation of the EMD variant, with a robust ground distance for oriented gradients. Finally, extensive experimental results on the Mikolajczyk and Schmid dataset [2] show that our method outperforms state of the art distances."

In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric."

This factorization was shown to be useful for several important computer vision applications. We propose here two new NMF algorithms that minimize the Earth mover's distance (EMD) error between the data and the matrix product. The algorithms (EMD NMF and bilateral EMD NMF) are iterative and based on linear programming methods. We prove their convergence, discuss their numerical difficulties, and propose efficient approximations. Naturally, the matrices obtained with EMD NMF are different from those obtained with L2-NMF. We discuss these differences in the context of two challenging computer vision tasks, texture classification and face recognition, perform actual NMF-based image segmentation for the first time, and demonstrate the advantages of the new methods with common benchmarks."

This scaling algorithm preserves symmetry of the original matrix and shows fast linear convergence with an asymptotic rate of 1/2. We discuss extensions of the algorithm to the 1-norm, and by inference to other norms. For the 1-norm case, we show again that convergence is linear, with the rate dependent on the spectrum of the scaled matrix. We demonstrate experimentally that the scaling algorithm improves the conditioning of the matrix and that it helps direct solvers by reducing the need for pivoting. In particular, for symmetric matrices the theoretical and experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed algorithm over existing alternatives."

By minimizing a single objective function, the approach utilizes simultaneously two quite different sources of information for restoration: spatial context in terms of some smoothness prior and nonspatial statistics in terms of the novel prior utilizing the Wasserstein distance between probability measures. We study the combination of the functional lifting technique with two different relaxations of the histogram prior and derive a jointly convex variational approach. Mathematical equivalence of both relaxations is established, and cases where optimality holds are discussed. Additionally, we present an efficient algorithmic scheme for the numerical treatment of the presented model. Experiments using the basic total variation based denoising app..."

We define the difference between two histograms to be a temperature field. We then study the relationship between histogram similarity and a diffusion process, showing how diffusion handles deformation as well as quantization effects. As a result, the diffusion distance is derived as the sum of dissimilarities over scales. Being a cross-bin histogram distance, the diffusion distance is robust to deformation, lighting change and noise in histogram-based local descriptors. In addition, it enjoys linear computational complexity which significantly improves previously proposed cross-bin distances with quadratic complexity or higher. We tested the proposed approach on both shape recognition and interest point matching tasks using several multi-dimensional histogram-based descriptors including shape context, SIFT, and spin images. In all experiments, the diffusion distance performs excellently in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with other state-of-the-art distance measures. In particular, it performs as accurately as the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance with much greater efficiency."

While its effectiveness has been shown in the traveling salesman problem, graph matching, and graph partitioning in thousands of simulations, its convergence properties have not been studied. Here, we construct discrete-time Lyapunov functions for the cases of exact and approximate doubly stochastic constraint satisfaction, which show convergence to a fixed point. The combination of good convergence properties and experimental success makes the softassign algorithm an excellent choice for neural quadratic assignment optimization."

Its convergence and statistical properties have been investigated since then by several authors and by several different methods. A natural extension of the IPFP to the case of bivariate densities has been introduced by Ireland and Kullback. It has been conjectured that also in the general case the IPFP converges to the minimum discrimination projection on the class of distributions with given marginals. We verify this conjecture under some regularity conditions."

If the adaptation is done correctly, models built on a specific data representation become more robust when confronted to data depicting the same classes, but described by another observation system. Among the many strategies proposed, finding domain-invariant representations has shown excellent properties, in particular since it allows to train a unique classifier effective in all domains. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labeled samples of the same class in the source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the labeled samples in the source and the distributions observed in both domains. Experiments on toy and challenging real visual adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, numerical experiments show that our approach leads to better performances on domain invariant deep learning features and can be easily adapted to the semi-supervised case where few labeled samples are available in the target domain."

In particular, we discuss a variational regularisation model endowed with a Kantorovich-Rubinstein discrepancy term and total variation regularization in the context of image denoising and cartoon-texture decomposition. We point out connections of this approach to several other recently proposed methods such as total generalized variation and norms capturing oscillating patterns. We also show that the respective optimization problem can be turned into a convex-concave saddle point problem with simple constraints and hence, can be solved by standard tools. Numerical examples exhibit interesting features and favourable performance for denoising and cartoon-texture decomposition."

In this work, we describe a minimax framework for statistical learning with ambiguity sets given by balls in Wasserstein space. In particular, we prove generalization bounds that involve the covering number properties of the original ERM problem. As an illustrative example, we provide generalization guarantees for transport-based domain adaptation problems where the Wasserstein distance between the source and target domain distributions can be reliably estimated from unlabeled samples."

We propose a novel approach for matrix factorization which is based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a measure of reconstruction error. Differently from previous works on EMD matrix decomposition, we consider a semi-supervised learning setting and we also propose to learn the ground distance parameters. While few previous works have addressed the problem of ground distance computation, these methods do not learn simultaneously the optimal metric and the reconstruction matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both on synthetic data experiments and on a real world scenario, i.e. addressing the problem of complex video scene analysis in the context of video surveillance applications. Our experiments show that our method allows not only to achieve state-of-the-art performance on video segmentation, but also to learn the relationship among elementary activities which characterize the high level events in the video scene."

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research."

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."

This dual viewpoint extends in a straightforward manner to suggest metrics between matrix-valued measures. Our main interest has been in developing weakly-continuous metrics that are suitable for comparing matrix-valued power spectral density functions. To this end, and following the suggested recipe of utilizing suitable families of test functions, we develop a weakly-continuous metric that is analogous to the Wasserstein metric and applies to matrix-valued densities. We use a numerical example to compare this metric to certain standard alternatives including a different version of a matricial Wasserstein metric developed in [1], [2]."

However, rather than decomposing each complex object into the single histogram of its components, we use for each object a family of nested histograms, where each histogram in this hierarchy describes the object seen from an increasingly granular perspective. We use this hierarchy of histograms to define elementary kernels which can detect coarse and fine similarities between the objects. We compute through an efficient averaging trick a mixture of such specific kernels, to propose a final kernel value which weights efficiently local and global matches. We propose experimental results on an image retrieval experiment which show that this mixture is an effective template procedure to be used with kernels on histograms."

The proposed approach relies on an optimal assignment of patches over decimated pixel grids. This assignment problem formulates the synthesis as the minimization of a discrepancy measure between input\u2019s and output\u2019s patches through their optimal permutation. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is addressed with an iterative algorithm alternating between a patch assignment step and a patch aggregation step. We show that this model statistically constrains the output texture content, while inheriting the structure-preserving property of patch-based methods. We also propose a relaxed patch assignment extension that increases the robustness to non-stationnary textures."

Though the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) has shown its advantages in matching histogram features, its potentials in matching GMMs remain unclear and are not fully explored. To address this problem, we propose a novel EMD methodology for GMM matching. We first present a sparse representation based EMD called SR-EMD by exploiting the sparse property of the underlying problem. SR-EMD is more efficient and robust than the conventional EMD. Second, we present two novel ground distances between component Gaussians based on the information geometry. The perspective from the Riemannian geometry distinguishes the proposed ground distances from the classical entropy-or divergence-based ones. Furthermore, motivated by the success of distance metric learning of vector data, we make the first attempt to learn the EMD distance metrics between GMMs by using a simple yet effective supervised pair-wise based method. It can adapt the distance metrics between GMMs to specific classification tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated data and benchmark real databases and achieves very promising performance."

After reviewing the properties of the distance and the metric geodesic, we derive an explicit form of the Riemannian metrics on positive-definite matrices and compute its tensor form with respect to the trace scalar product. The tensor is a matrix, which is the solution of a Lyapunov equation. We compute explicit form for the Riemannian exponential, the normal coordinates charts, the Riemannian gradient, and discuss the gradient flow of the entropy. Finally, the Levi-Civita covariant derivative is computed in matrix form together with the differential equation for the parallel transport. While all computations are given in matrix form, notheless we discuss the use of a special moving frame. Applications are briefly discussed."

The algorithm utilizes the soft assign for the correspondence and the thin-plate spline for the non-rigid mapping. Embedded within a deterministic annealing framework, the algorithm can automatically reject a fraction of the points as outliers. Experiments on both 2D synthetic point-sets with varying degrees of deformation, noise and outliers, and on real 3D sulcal point-sets (extracted from brain MRI) demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm."

The result is the following. The sequence of matrices converges to a doubly stochastic limit if and only if the matrix A contains at least one positive diagonal. A necessary and sufficient condition that there exist diagonal matrices A and D2 with positive main diagonals such that D1AD2 is both doubly stochastic and the limit of the iteration is that A\u03c6O and each positive entry of A is contained in a positive diagonal. The form D\u03b9AD2 is unique, and A and D2 are unique up to a positive scalar multiple if and only if A is fully indecomposable."

After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence.

The problem of vector quantile regression is formulated as an optimal transport problem subject to an additional mean-independence condition. This paper provides a new set of results on VQR beyond the case with correct specification which had been the focus of previous work. First, we show that even under misspecification, the VQR problem still has a solution which provides a general representation of the conditional dependence between random vectors. Second, we provide a detailed comparison with the classical approach of Koenker and Bassett in the case when the dependent variable is univariate and we show that in that case, VQR is equivalent to classical quantile regression with an additional monotonicity constraint."

The idea is to start from the limit of zero kinetic energy and systematically expand the universal energy functional of the density in powers of a \"coupling constant\" that controls the magnitude of the kinetic energy. The problem of minimizing the energy is reduced to the solution of a strictly correlated electron problem in the presence of an effective potential, which in our theory plays the same role as the Kohn-Sham potential plays in the traditional formulation. We discuss several schemes for approximating the energy functional, and report preliminary results for low-density quantum dots."

                "text": "Many spectral unmixing methods rely on the non-negative decomposition of spectral data onto a dictionary of spectral templates. In particular, state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the input signal onto a dictionary of representative note spectra. The typical measures of fit used to quantify the adequacy of the decomposition compare the data and template entries frequency-wise. As such, small displacements of energy from a frequency bin to another as well as variations of timbre can disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal transportation and propose a new measure of fit that treats the frequency distributions of energy holistically as opposed to frequency-wise. Building on the harmonic nature of sound, the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy to harmonically-related frequencies, as well as to small and local displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit, the dictionary of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on real musical data. 1 Context Many of nowadays spectral unmixing techniques rely on non-negative matrix decompositions. This concerns for example hyperspectral remote sensing (with applications in Earth observation, astronomy, chemistry, etc.) or audio signal processing. The spectral sample v n (the spectrum of light observed at a given pixel n, or the audio spectrum in a given time frame n) is decomposed onto a dictionary W of elementary spectral templates, characteristic of pure materials or sound objects, such that v n \u2248 Wh n. The composition of sample n can be inferred from the non-negative expansion coefficients h n. This paradigm has led to state-of-the-art results for various tasks (recognition, classification, denoising, separation) in the aforementioned areas, and in particular in music transcription, the central application of this paper. In state-of-the-art music transcription systems, the spectrogram V (with columns v n) of a musical signal is decomposed onto a dictionary of pure notes (in so-called multi-pitch estimation) or chords. V typically consists of (power-)magnitude values of a regular short-time Fourier transform (Smaragdis and Brown, 2003). It may also consists of an audio-specific spectral transform such as the Mel-frequency transform, like in (Vincent et al., 2010), or the Q-constant based transform, like in (Oudre et al., 2011). The success of the transcription system depends of course on the adequacy of the time-frequency transform & the dictionary to represent the data V."

While several nonparametric divergence estimators exist, relatively few have known convergence properties. In particular, even for those estimators whose MSE convergence rates are known, the asymptotic distributions are unknown. We establish the asymptotic normality of a recently proposed ensemble estimator of f-divergence between two distributions from a finite number of samples. This estimator has MSE convergence rate of O (1/T), is simple to implement, and performs well in high dimensions. This theory enables us to perform divergence-based inference tasks such as testing equality of pairs of distributions based on empirical samples. We experimentally validate our theoretical results and, as an illustration, use them to empirically bound the best achievable classification error."

Popular data assimilation algorithms include sequential Monte Carlo methods and ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs). These methods differ in the way Bayesian inference is implemented. Sequential Monte Carlo methods rely on importance sampling combined with a resampling step, while EnKFs utilize a linear transformation of Monte Carlo samples based on the classic Kalman filter. While EnKFs have proven to be quite robust even for small ensemble sizes, they are not consistent since their derivation relies on a linear regression ansatz. In this paper, we propose another transform method, which does not rely on any a priori assumptions on the underlying prior and posterior distributions. The new method is based on solving an optimal transportation problem for discrete random variables."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Thus, this paper introduces a technique for graph-based semi-supervised learning of histograms, derived from the theory of optimal transportation. Our method has several properties making it suitable for this application; in particular, its behavior can be characterized by the moments and shapes of the histograms at the labeled nodes. In addition, it can be used for histograms on non-standard domains like circles, revealing a strategy for manifold-valued semi-supervised learning. We also extend this technique to related problems such as smoothing distributions on graph nodes."

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign."

Using barycenters of measures in the Wasserstein space, we propose an iterative version as an estimation of the mean distribution. Moreover, when the distributions are a common measure warped by a centered random operator, then the barycenter enables to recover this distribution template."

Experimentally we show OT-GAN to be highly stable when trained with large mini-batches, and we present state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmark problems for image generation."

We show that the optimal estimator and the least favorable distribution form a Nash equilibrium. Despite the non-convex nature of the ambiguity set, we prove that the estimation problem is equivalent to a tractable convex program. We further devise a Frank-Wolfe algorithm for this convex program whose direction-searching subproblem can be solved in a quasi-closed form. Using these ingredients, we introduce a distributionally robust Kalman filter that hedges against model risk."

Because strong security properties (key-security and subspace-security) can be achieved using natural watermarking (NW) since this particular embedding lets the distribution of the host and watermarked signals unchanged, we use elements of transportation theory to minimize the global distortion. Next, we apply this new modulation, called transportation NW (TNW), to design a secure watermarking scheme for grayscale images. The TNW uses a multiresolution image decomposition combined with a multiplicative embedding which is taken into account at the distribution level. We show that the distortion solely relies on the variance of the wavelet subbands used during the embedding. In order to maximize a target robustness after JPEG compression, we select different combinations of subbands offering the lowest Bit Error Rates for a target PSNR ranging from 35 to 55 dB and we propose an algorithm to select them. The use of transportation theory also provides an average PSNR gain of 3.6 dB on PSNR with respect to the previous embedding for a set of 2000 images."

Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains."

The Sinkhorn divergence allows the fast computation of an entropically regularized Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions supported on a finite metric space of (possibly) high-dimension. For data sampled from one or two unknown probability distributions, we derive central limit theorems for empirical Sinkhorn divergences. We also propose a bootstrap procedure which allows to obtain new test statistics for measuring the discrepancies between multivariate probability distributions. The strategy of proof uses the notions of directional Hadamard differentiability and delta-method in this setting. It is inspired by the results in the work of Sommerfeld and Munk (2016) on the asymptotic distribution of empirical Wasserstein distance on finite space using un-regularized transportation costs. Simulated and real datasets are used to illustrate our approach. A comparison with existing methods to measure the discrepancy between multivariate distributions is also proposed."
