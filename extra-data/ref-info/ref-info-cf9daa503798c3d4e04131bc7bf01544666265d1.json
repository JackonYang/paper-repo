Due to the heterogeneous and unpredictable capability of online annotators, various strategies have been proposed to \u201cclean\u201d crowdsourced annotations. However, these strategies typically involve getting more annotations, perhaps different types of annotations (e.g. a grading task), rather than computationally assessing the annotation or image content. In this paper we propose and evaluate several strategies for automatically estimating the quality of a spatial object annotation. We show that one can significantly outperform simple baselines, such as that used by LabelMe, by combining multiple image-based annotation assessment strategies."

The system interleaves interactive labeling (where the current model is used to semi-automate the labeling of a new example) and online learning (where a newly labeled example is used to update the current model parameters). This framework is scalable to large datasets and complex image models and is shown to have excellent theoretical and practical properties in terms of train time, optimality guarantees, and bounds on the amount of annotation effort per image. We apply this framework to part-based detection, and introduce a novel algorithm for interactive labeling of deformable part models. The labeling tool updates and displays in real-time the maximum likelihood location of all parts as the user clicks and drags the location of one or more parts. We demonstrate that the system can be used to efficiently and robustly train part and pose detectors on the CUB Birds-200-a challenging dataset of birds in unconstrained pose and environment."

                "text": "Labeling large datasets has become faster, cheaper, and easier with the advent of crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk. How can one trust the labels obtained from such services? We propose a model of the labeling process which includes label uncertainty, as well a multi-dimensional measure of the annotators' ability. From the model we derive an online algorithm that estimates the most likely value of the labels and the annotator abilities. It finds and prioritizes experts when requesting labels, and actively excludes unreliable annotators. Based on labels already obtained, it dynamically chooses which images will be labeled next, and how many labels to request in order to achieve a desired level of confidence. Our algorithm is general and can handle binary, multi-valued, and continuous annotations (e.g. bounding boxes). Experiments on a dataset containing more than 50,000 labels show that our algorithm reduces the number of labels required, and thus the total cost of labeling, by a large factor while keeping error rates low on a variety of datasets."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We present a method for estimating the underlying value (e.g. the class) of each image from (noisy) annotations provided by multiple annotators. Our method is based on a model of the image formation and annotation process. Each image has different characteristics that are represented in an abstract Euclidean space. Each annotator is modeled as a multidimensional entity with variables representing competence, expertise and bias. This allows the model to discover and represent groups of annotators that have different sets of skills and knowledge, as well as groups of images that differ qualitatively. We find that our model predicts ground truth labels on both synthetic and real data more accurately than state of the art methods. Experiments also show that our model, starting from a set of binary labels, may discover rich information, such as different \"schools of thought\" amongst the annotators, and can group together images belonging to separate categories."

Some contemporary vision systems already require on the order of millions of images for training (e.g., Omron face detector [9]). New Internet-based services allow for a large number of labelers to collaborate around the world at very low cost. However, using these services brings interesting theoretical and practical challenges: (1) The labelers may have wide ranging levels of expertise which are unknown a priori, and in some cases may be adversarial; (2) images may vary in their level of difficulty; and (3) multiple labels for the same image must be combined to provide an estimate of the actual label of the image. Probabilistic approaches provide a principled way to approach these problems. In this paper we present a probabilistic model and use it to simultaneously infer the label of each image, the expertise of each labeler, and the difficulty of each image. On both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that the model outperforms the commonly used \"Majority Vote\" heuristic for inferring image labels, and is robust to both noisy and adversarial labelers."
