                "text": "1. We have studied the visual enhancement effect in two areas of the cerebral cortex of monkeys. The response of the cells to a visual stimulus was determined both when the monkey used the visual stimulus as the target for a saccadic eye movement and when he did not. 2. In striate cortex cells with nonoriented, simple, complex, and hypercomplex receptive-field types were studied. Clear enhancement of the response to the appropriate visual stimulus was seldom seen when the monkey used the stimulus as a target for a saccade. In addition, any enhancement effect seen was nonselective; it occurred whether the monkey made a saccade to the receptive-field stimulus or some other stimulus at a point distant from the receptive field. The enhancement also occurred whether the monkey made a saccade to the stimulus or just released the bar when the stimulus dimmed. 3. This nonselective enhancement in striate cortex is in striking contrast to the selective enhancement of the visual response seen in the superior colliculus. The different characteristics of the enhancement in striate cortex and the observation of enhancement in the colliculus following ablation of striate cortex suggest that this cortical area is an unlikely source of the collicular enhancement. 4. These observations reinforce the distinction between striate cortex and superior colliculus. Striate cortex is an excellent analyzer of stimulus characteristics but a poor evaluator of stimulus significance. The superior colliculus is an excellent evaluator but a poor analyzer. 5. The area of frontal eye fields in which cells have clear visual responses has been better localized. Enhancement of the visual response of these cells also occurs and, at least for some cells, the response enhancement is selective. The response enhancement, like the visual properties of these frontal eye field cells, appears to be more closely related to the properties of superior colliculus cells than to striate cortex cells."

The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

                "text": "IN THE LAST DEC,ADE, considerable progress has been made in understanding the physiology of one of the most fundamental aspects of human experience: perception of the visual world. It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

After bilateral removal of striate cortex, no inferotemporal neurons responded to visual stimuli. After unilateral removal of striate cortex, inferotemporal neurons in both hemispheres responded only to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the intact striate cortex. After section of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, inferotemporal neurons in both hemispheres responded only to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the recording site. These results indicate that inferotemporal cortex visual information from striate cortex and that the pathway from striate cortex to the contralateral inferotemporal cortex includes the forebrain commissures. This same striate-temporal pathway is also necessary for normal discrimination learning. We suggest that the converging input onto single inferotemporal neurons from widely separated retinal areas may provide a mechanism for stimulus equivalence over different parts of the visual field, and it may be the absence of such a mechanism that contributes to the visual discrimination deficit that follows inferotemporal lesions."

                "text": "1. The topographic organization of prestriate visual cortex in the rhesus monkey has been studied both anatomically, by determining the pattern of termination of fibres passing through the corpus callosum, and physiologically, in the same animals, by plotting receptive field positions for different recording sites. Results are displayed on two\u2010dimensional, \"unfolded\" maps of the cortex in the dorsal half of the occipital lobe. 2. Transcallosal fibres terminate in a narrow strip of cortex along the boundary between striate and prestriate areas and in a separate, broader, zone occupying much of the anterior bank of the lunate sulcus, the annectant gyrus, and the parietooccipital sulcus. The detailed pattern of inputs is highly complicated but shows considerable similarities from one animal to the next. 3. Physiological recordings confirmed earlier reports that regions where transcallosal fibres terminate correspond to representations of the vertical meridian in the visual field. This relationship is most precise along the striate\u2010prestriate boundary and along the boundary of area V3 farthest from V1; it is less precise within area V4, where the pattern of transcallosal inputs is more complex. 4. A distinct, topographically organized visual area, named V3A, was found in the region between areas V3 and V4 in the lunate and parieto\u2010occipital sulci. Area V3A differs from V2 and V3 in that both superior and inferior visual quadrants are represented in a single region of the dorsal occipital lobe. 5. The contralateral visual field is represented in a suprisingly complex fashion in areas V3A and V4. Within each area there are multiple representations of some, but perhaps not all, parts of the visual hemifield. It is unclear whether V3A and V4 should be more appropriately considered as sets of distinct sub\u2010areas, each representing only a portion of the hemifield, or as larger areas with complicated internal topographies. 6. Most cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A are orientation selective but not selective for stimulus colour or direction of movement. In contrast, area V4 contains a higher incidence of colour selective cells and a lower incidence of orientation selectivity. These results support the notion of a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex."

The electrical signs of the activity of single cortical cells were recorded with microelectrodes in waking animals as they carried out certain behavioral acts in response to a series of sensory cues. The behavioral paradigms were one for detection alone, and a second for detection plus projection of the arm to contact a stationary or moving target placed at arm's length. Of the 125 microelectrode penetrations made, 1,451 neurons were identified in terms of the correlation of their activity with the behavioral acts and their sensitivity or lack of it to sensory stimuli delivered passively; 180 were studied quantitatively. The locations of cortical neurons were identified in serial sections; 94 penetrations and 1,058 neurons were located with certainty. About two-thirds of the neurons of area 5 were activated by passive rotation of the limbs at their joints; of these, 82% were related to single, contralateral joints, 10% to two or more contralateral joints, 6% to ipsilateral, and 2% to joints on both sides of the body. A few of the latter were active during complex bodily postures. A large proportion of area 5 neurons were relatively insensitive to passive joint rotations, as compared with similar neurons of the postcentral gyrus, but were driven to high rates of discharge when the same joint was rotated during an active movement of the animal..."

                "text": "In the rhesus monkey, the caudal portion of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) receives a direct projection from lateral striate cortex, the striate area representing central vision. The present study was undertaken to determine whether STS also receives a direct projection from areas of striate cortex representing peripheral vision, with the intent of defining the entire striate projection zone in STS as well as providing information regarding a possible topographic organization within this secondary visual area. A series of five rhesus monkeys was prepared with unilateral lesions of lateral, posterior, or medial striate cortex, such that, collectively, the lesions in the series included all of striate cortex with little or no invasion of prestriate cortex. The monkeys were sacrificed seven days after surgery and their brains were processed by the Fink\u2010Heimer procedure. An analysis of the distribution of terminal degeneration within STS indicated: (1) All areas of striate cortex project to a restricted region along the caudal portion of STS. The ventral limit of this region can be demarcated by an imaginary line connecting the ventral tips of the lunate and intraparietal sulci; from this limit the region extends dorsocaudally for approximately 12 mm to the point at which STS frequently bifurcates, sending one spur forward into the inferior parietal lobule. (2) Within this portion of STS there is an orderly mapping of the visual field; progression from central vision to the far periphery is represented by a progression down the posterior bank of STS and continuing along the entire floor, or insula\u2010like portion, of the sulcus. (3) Projections from striate cortex to STS terminate predominantly in layer IV and the deep part of layer III. (4) There is a distinctive pattern of myelination contained within the striate projection zone of STS. These anatomical findings concerning the striate projection zone of STS. in the rhesus monkey are remarkably similar to those that have been described for the middle temporal visual area (MT) in New World monkeys, and thus support earlier proposals that the two areas are homologous."

The receptive field properties are such that for a given position of the eyes, each neurone will respond to an optimally oriented, moving line only if there is a particular disparity between the images of that line on each retina. As most of the receptive field disparities have a horizontal component, the response is related to movement of the line in a plane at a particular distance. If the plane of the optimally oriented stimulus is moved so it is effectively closer or further from the animal, there is a sharp decrease in the binocular response of the neurone, often to levels below the response to one eye alone4,5. Most of the disparity-specific neurones so far described1\u20136 are maximally responsive when the disparity is constant, at some particuar value, and cease to respond well when the disparity is changed from that value."

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

Using a stereptaxic method, microelectrodes were inserted through the contralateral hemisphere in order to make electrolytic lesions of the superior colliculus. Large lesions involved all layers of the superior colliculus, while smaler lesions involved either the superficial or the deep layers of the superior colliculus. Following various survival times, the brains were prepared with the Fink\u2010Heimer technique (1967). Following lesions of the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, definite degenerated axonal endings were found in the dorsal and ventral lateral genuculate nuclei, inferior pulvinar, centrontermediate nucleus, magnocellular dorsomedial nucleus, anterior pretectal nucleus and pretectal refion. Sparse degenerated axonal endings were found in the limitans nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus and some intralaminar nuclei following lesions of the superficial layers in the rostral portion of the superior colliculus. Following lesions of the deep layers of the superior colliculus, degenerated axonal endings were found in the central gray, magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus, suprageniculatre nucleus, limations nucleus, lateral posterior nulceus, medial and oral pulvinarm nucleus of athe accessory optic tract, zona incerta, subdivisions of the ventral lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, ventral posterior inferior nulceus, densocellular and mulriform dorsomedial nuclei, all intralaminar nucleim inferior coliculus, parabigeminal nucleus, olivary nucleus, reunions nucleus, Forel's Field H and an undefined midbrain nucleus. In general the projections were topographically organized in that the caudal portions of thalamic nuclei. All the degeneration patterns seen after lesions of the superficial and dep layers were accoundted for by large lesions which involved all layers of the superior colliculus. It is conclude that the superficial and deep layers of the rhesus monkey superior colliculus have different ascending projections. The findings are related to the organization of visual and multimodal thalamocortical system in primates and other mammals."

                "text": "We describe psychophysical evidence that the human visual system contains information-processing channels for motion in depth in addition to those for position in depth. These motion-in-depth channels include some that are selectively sensitive to the relative velocities of the left and right retinal images. We propose that the visual pathway contains stereoscopic (cyclopean) motion filters that respond to only a narrow range of the directions of motion in depth. Turning to the single-neuron level we report that, in addition to neurons tuned to position in depth, cat visual cortex contains neurons that emphasize information about the direction of motion at the expense of positional information. We describe psychophysical evidence for the existence of channels that are sensitive to changing size, and are separate from the channels both for motion and for flicker. These changing-size channels respond independently of whether the stimulus is a bright square on a dark ground or a dark square on a bright ground. At the physiological level we report single neurons in cat visual cortex that respond selectively to increasing or to decreasing size independently of the sign of stimulus contrast. Adaptation to a changing-size stimulus produces two separable after-effects: an illusion of changing size, and an illusion of motion in depth. These after-effects have different decay time constants. We propose a psychophysical model in which changing-size filters feed a motion-in-depth stage, and suppose that the motion-in-depth after-effect is due to activity at the motion-in-depth stage, while the changing-size after-effect is due to activity at the changing-size and more peripheral stages. The motion-in-depth after-effect can be cancelled either by a changing-size test stimulus or by relative motion of the left and right retinal images. Opposition of these two cues can also cancel the impression of motion in depth produced by the adapting stimulus. These findings link the stereoscopic (cyclopean) motion filters and the changing-size filters : both feed the same motion-in-depth stage."

                "text": "ZusammenfassungVersuche an \u201esplit-brain\u201c Affen legten die Annahme nahe, da\u00df die Wahrnehmung des Raumes und die Wahrnehmung der Identit\u00e4t von Gegenst\u00e4nden auf anatomisch getrennten Hirnmechanismen beruhen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Sehmechanismen des Gehirns untersucht, wobei von der \u00dcberlegung ausgegangen wird, da\u00df hier zwei parallele Prozesse involviert sind: ein dezentrierter (\u201eambient\u201c), der die Wahrnehmung des den K\u00f6rper umgebenden Raumes bestimmt, und ein zentrierter (\u201efocal\u201c), durch welchen Details kleiner Raumfl\u00e4chen aufgefa\u00dft werden.Bei Wirbeltieren wird eine detaillierte Topographie des k\u00f6rper-zentrierten Verhaltensraumes vom Auge zum Mittelhirn projiziert. Diese visuelle Topographie ist so mit dem bi-symmetrischen motorischen System integriert, da\u00df sich eine Korrespondenz zwischen gesehenen Punkten und Bewegungszielen ergibt.Das phylogenetisch j\u00fcngere visuelle System des Vorderhirns befa\u00dft sich fast ausschlie\u00dflich mit dem zentralen Verhaltensraum; die corticale motorische Kontrolle befa\u00dft sich entsprechend mit sehr spezifischen Handlungen im gleichen zentralen Gebiet.Anatomie und Hirnchirurgie liefern bei Primaten Hinweise auf einen visuellen Mechanismus im Mittelhirn, der f\u00fcr die dezentrierte Raumwahrnehmung eine Rolle spielt. Im Gegensatz dazu greift das auf Fovea, Parafovea und den visuellen Arealen des Cortex beruhende zentrierte Sehen Areale des umgebenden Feldes f\u00fcr eine eingehendere Inspektion heraus. Koordinierte Augenbewegungen sind direkter Ausdruck dieser Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung.Die Wechselwirkung zweier Mechanismen der visuellen Analyse kennzeichnet das Sehen bei allen aktiven Tieren. Die Komplexit\u00e4t des zentrierten Sehens zeigt sich auf allen Stufen des visuellen Systems von Primaten und in den Teilen des motorischen Systems, welche das Sehen ausrichten und die auf bestimmte visuelle Objekte gerichteten Handlungen steuern.SummaryExperiments with split-brain monkeys led me to consider that vision of space and vision of object identity may be subserved by anatomically distinct brain mechanisms. In this paper I examine the visual mechanisms of the brain to test the idea that vision involves two parallel processes; one ambient, determining space at large around the body, the other focal which examines detail in small areas of space.In vertebrates there is a projection from eye to midbrain of a detailed topography of body-centered behavioral space. This visual map is integrated with the bisymmetric motor system to obtain correspondence between visual loci and the goals for movements. The midbrain visual system governs basic vertebrate locomotor behavior.The phylogenetically more recent forebrain visual system looks almost exclusively at central behavioral space, and cortical motor control is likewise concerned with the formulation of highly specific acts in the same central territory.Anatomy and brain surgery reveal a midbrain visual mechanism in primates which plays a part in ambient space perception over the whole field. In contrast, focal vision served by the fovea and parafovea and by the cortical visual areas picks out areas in the ambient field for close attention. Conjugate eye movements are the most direct sign of this attention.The interplay between the two channels of visual analysis is a feature of vision in all active animals; but the complexity of focal vision in primates is revealed in their visual system at all levels, and in the parts of the motor system which orient vision, or which govern acts directed to specific visual objects."
