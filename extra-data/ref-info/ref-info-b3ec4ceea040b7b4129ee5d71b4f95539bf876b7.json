It contains all the available geometric information and enables to recover the epipolar geometry from uncalibrated perspective views. This paper addresses the important problem of its robust determination given a number of image point correspondences. We first define precisely this matrix and show clearly how it is related to the epipolar geometry and to the essential matrix introduced earlier by Longuet-Higgins. In particular, we show that this matrix, defined up to a scale factor, must be of rank two. Different parametrizations for this matrix are then proposed to take into account these important constraints and linear and non-linear criteria for its estimation are also considered. We then clearly show that the linear criterion is unable to express the rank and normalization constraints. Using the linear criterion leads definitely to the worst result in the determination of the fundamental matrix. Several examples on real images clearly illustrate and validate this important negative result. To overcome the major weaknesses of the linear criterion, different non-linear criteria are proposed and analyzed in great detail. Extensive experimental work has been performed in order to compare the different methods using a large number of noisy synthetic data and real images. In particular, a statistical method based on variation of camera displacements is used to evaluate the stability and convergence properties of each method."

It uses multiple attributes associated with each image point to yield a generally overdetermined system of constraints, taking into account possible structural discontinuities and occlusions. In the algorithm implemented, intensity, edgeness, and cornerness attributes are used in conjunction with the constraints arising from intraregional smoothness, field continuity and discontinuity, and occlusions to compute dense displacement fields and occlusion maps along the pixel grids. The intensity, edgeness, and cornerness are invariant under rigid motion in the image plane. In order to cope with large disparities, a multiresolution multigrid structure is employed. Coarser level edgeness and cornerness measures are obtained by blurring the finer level measures. The algorithm has been tested on real-world scenes with depth discontinuities and occlusions. A special case of two-view matching is stereo matching, where the motion between two images is known. The algorithm can be easily specialized to perform stereo matching using the epipolar constraint. >"

The primary reason for this is that one of the most useful cues, namely shape similarity, is not appropriately exploited. Making full use of shape similarity for disambiguation requires determining an appropriate criterion and an adequate implementation. We show that a disparity gradient (DG) limit as small as 0.2 can be used to ensure shape similarity and permits the majority of scene surfaces to be correctly handled. This DG limit is a compromise between the quantity of matches and the quality of matching. The implementation of a DG limit is made effective by explicitly taking into account uncertainty in image point positions. A very effcient voting scheme is proposed. Many tests have been performed, mostly on complex real scenes, but none of the parameters has been adjusted. The results are satisfactory both in terms of the quantity of matches and the correctness of these in normal circumstances."

An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."

This problem is relevant not only to photographic surveying1 but also to binocular vision2, where the non-visual information available to the observer about the orientation and focal length of each eye is much less accurate than the optical information supplied by the retinal images themselves. The problem also arises in monocular perception of motion3, where the two projections represent views which are separated in time as well as space. As Marr and Poggio4 have noted, the fusing of two images to produce a three-dimensional percept involves two distinct processes: the establishment of a 1:1 correspondence between image points in the two views\u2014the \u2018correspondence problem\u2019\u2014and the use of the associated disparities for determining the distances of visible elements in the scene. I shall assume that the correspondence problem has been solved; the problem of reconstructing the scene then reduces to that of finding the relative orientation of the two viewpoints."

Three categories of problems are considered, depending upon whether the features are two (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) and the type of correspondence: a) 3D to 3D (i.e., locations of corresponding features in 3D space are known at two different times), b) 2D to 3D (i.e., locations of features in 3D space and their projection on the camera plane are known, and c) 2D to 2D (i.e., projections of features on the camera plane are known at two different times). Features considered include points, straight lines, curved lines, and corners. Emphasis is on problem formulation, efficient algorithms for solution, existence and uniqueness of solutions, and sensitivity of solutions to noise in the observed data. Algorithms described have been used in a variety of applications. Some of these are: a) positioning and navigating 3D objects in a 3D world, b) camera calibration, i.e., determining location and orientation of a camera by observing 3D features whose location is known, c) estimating motion and structure of moving objects relative to a camera. We mention some of the mathematical techniques borrowed from algebraic geometry, projective geometry, and homotopy theory that are required to solve these problems, list unsolved problems, and give some directions for future research. >"

An algorithm is presented that gives a closed-form solution for motion parameters and the structure of the scene. The algorithm utilizes redundancy in the data to obtain more reliable estimates in the presence of noise. An approach is introduced to estimating the errors in the motion parameters computed by the algorithm. Specifically, standard deviation of the error is estimated in terms of the variance of the errors in the image coordinates of the corresponding points. The estimated errors indicate the reliability of the solution as well as any degeneracy or near degeneracy that causes the failure of the motion estimation algorithm. The presented approach to error estimation applies to a wide variety of problems that involve least-squares optimization or pseudoinverse. Finally the relationships between errors and the parameters of motion and imaging system are analyzed. The results of the analysis show, among other things, that the errors are very sensitive to the translation direction and the range of field view. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms and error estimation as well as the relationships between the errors and the parameters of motion and imaging systems. The algorithms are tested on images of real-world scenes with point of correspondences computed automatically. >"

The key is to propose some efficient models associated to each of these features directly from the image by searching the parameters of the model that best approximate the observed grey level image intensities. Due to the large amount of time required by a first approach that assumes the blur of the imaging acquisition system to be describable by a 2-D Gaussian filter, different solutions that drastically reduce this computational time are considered and developed. The problem of the initialization phase in the minimization process is considered, and an original and efficient solution is proposed. A large number of experiments involving real images are conducted in order to test and compare the reliability, the robustness, and the efficiency of the proposed approaches.<<ETX>>"

We utilize the fact that two views of a static 3D point set are linked by a 3 X 3 Fundamental Matrix (F). The Fundamental Matrix contains all the information on structure and motion from a given set of point correspondences and is derived by a least squares method under the assumption that the majority of the image is undergoing a rigid motion. Least squares is the most commonly used method of parameter estimation in computer vision algorithms. However the estimated parameters from a least squares fit can be corrupted beyond recognition in the presence of gross errors or outliers which plague any data from real imagery. Features with a motion independent of the background are those statistically inconsistent from the calculated value of (F). Well founded methods for detecting these outlying points are described."

It contains all the available geometric information and enables to recover the epipolar geometry from uncalibrated perspective views. This paper is about a stability analysis for the Fundamental matrix. We first present a probabilistic approach which works well. This approch, however, does not give insight into the causes of unstability. Two complementary explanations for unstability are the nature of the motions, and the interaction between motion and three-dimensional structure, which is characterized by a critical surface. Practical methods to characterize the proximity to the critical surface from image measurements, by estimating a quadratic transformation, are developped. They are then used for experiments which validate our observations. It turns out that surprisingly enough, the critical surface affects the stability of the fundamental matrix in a significant number of situations."

It is based on the hypothesize-and-verify paradigm used to match 3D line segments between the two frames. In order to reduce the complexity of the method, an assumption is made that objects are rigid. The formulate a set of complete rigidity constraints for 3D line segments and integrate the uncertainty of measurements in this formation. The hypothesize-and-verify stages of the method use an extended Kalman filter to produce estimates of the displacements and of their uncertainty. The algorithm is shown to work on indoor and natural scenes. It is also shown to be easily extended to the case in which several mobile objects are present. The method is quite robust, fast, and has been thoroughly tested on hundreds of real stereo frames. >"

The seven points should not be traversed by two planes with one plane containing the origin, nor by a cone containing the origin. Second, a set of ``essential parameters'' are introduced which uniquely determine the motion parameters up to a scale factor for the translations, and can be estimated by solving a set of linear equations which are derived from the correspondences of eight image points. The actual motion parameters can subsequently be determined by computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a 3\u00d73 matrix containing the essential parameters."

The method consists of extracting local image structures and matching similar such structures between two images. Linear edge segments are extracted from both the left and right images. Each segment is characterized by its position and orientation in the image as well as its relationships with the nearby segments. A relational graph is thus built from each image. For each segment in one image as set of potential assignments is represented as a set of nodes in a correspondence graph. Arcs in the graph represent compatible assignments established on the basis of segment relationships. Stereo matching becomes equivalent to searching for sets of mutually compatible nodes in this graph. Sets are found by looking for maximal cliques. The maximal clique best suited to represent a stereo correspondence is selected using a benefit function. Numerous results obtained with this method are shown. >"

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

Closed-form least-squares solutions are given to the overconstrained 2D-2D and 3D-3D pose estimation problems. A globally convergent iterative technique is given for the 2D-perspective-projection-3D pose estimation problem. A simplified linear solution and a robust solution to the 2D-perspective-projection-2D-perspective-projection pose-estimation problem are also given. Simulation experiments consisting of millions of trials with varying numbers of pairs of corresponding points and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with either Gaussian or uniform noise provide data suggesting that accurate inference of rotation and translation with noisy data may require corresponding point data sets with hundreds of corresponding point pairs when the SNR is less than 40 dB. The experimental results also show that the robust technique can suppress the blunder data which come from outliers or mismatched points. >"

The estimation of optical flow fields is discussed, exhibiting a common foundation for feature-based and differential approaches. The interpretation of optical flow fields is mostly concerned so far with approaches which infer the 3-D structure of a rigid point configuration in 3-D space and its relative motion with respect to the image sensor from an image sequence. The combination of stereo and motion provides additional incentives to evaluate image sequences, especially for the control of robots and autonomous vehicles. Advances in all these areas lead to the desire to describe the spatio-temporal development recorded by an image sequence not only at the level of geometry, but also at higher conceptual levels, for example by natural language descriptions."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The partial modeling takes place by taking the Bayesian statistical decision rule and a number of important heuristics into consideration while maximizing the log likelihood function. Applications include the automatic selection of multiple thresholds, single rigid motion estimation or multiple rigid motion segmentation, and estimation from two perspective views. It is believed that the proposed MF estimator will aid in solving many robust estimation problems that demand an estimator that is either highly robust or capable of handling contaminated Gaussian mixture models. >"

Even the best edge operators can not reliably detect these two-dimensional features. This contribution proposes a solution to the two-dimensional problem. In this paper, I address the following: \u2022 'L'-junction detection. Previous attempts, relying on the second differentials of the image surface have essentially measured image curvature. Recently Harris [Harris 87] implemented a 'corner' detector that is based only on first differentials. I provide a mathematical proof to explain how this algorithm estimates image curvature. Although this algorithm will isolate image 'L'junctions, its performance cannot be predicted for T'-junctions and other higher order image structures. \u2022 Instead, an image representation is proposed that exploits the richness of the local differential geometrical 'topography ' of the intensity surface. Theoretical and experimental results are presented which demonstrate how idealised instances of two-dimensional surface features such as junctions can be characterised by the differential geometry of a simple facet model. \u2022 Preliminary results are very encouraging. Current studies are concerned with the extension to real data. I am investigating statistical noise models to provide a measure of 'confidence' in the geometric labelling. The richness and sparseness of a two-dimensional structure can be exploited in many high-level vision processes. I intend to use my representation to explore some of these fields in future work."

It consists of two modules, namely a motion estimation and a motion segmentation module. The motion estimation problem is formulated as a time varying motion parameter estimation over multiple frames. Robust regression techniques are used to estimate these parameters. The motion parameters for the different moving objects are obtained by successive estimations on regions for which the previously estimated motion parameters are not valid. The segmentation module combines all motion parameters and the gray level information in order to obtain the motion boundaries and to improve them by using time integration. Experimental results on real image sequences with static or moving camera in the presence of multiple moving objects are reported."

We present a novel technique to reject outliers from an m-dimensional data set when the underlying model is a hyperplane (a line in two dimensions, a plane in three dimensions). The technique has a sound statistical basis and assumes that Gaussian noise corrupts the otherwise valid data. The majority of alternative techniques available in the literature focus on ordinary least squares, where a single variable is designated to be dependent on all others - a model that is often unsuitable in practice. The method presented here operates in the more general framework of orthogonal regression, and uses a new regression diagnostic based on eigendecomposition. It subsumes the traditional residuals scheme and, using matrix perturbation theory, provides an error model for the solution once the contaminants have been removed."

We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."

This paper introduces a new perspective toward relaxation-that of considering it as a process for reordering labels attached to nodes in a graph. This new perspective is used to establish the formal equivalence between relaxation and another widely used algorithm, local maxima selection. The equivalence specifies conditions under which a family of cooperative relaxation algorithms, which generalize the well-known ones, decompose into purely local ones. Since these conditions are also sufficient for guaranteeing the convergence of relaxation processes, they serve as stopping criteria. We feel that equivalences such as these are necessary for the proper application of relaxation and maxima selection in complex speech and vision understanding systems."
