The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

The inputs along a path form a product and the products for all paths are summed. We also have a set of probabilities on the edges so that the outflow from each node is one. We then discuss multiplicative updates on these graphs where the prediction is essentially a kernel computation and the update contributes a factor to each edge. Now the total outflow out of each node is not one any more. However some clever algorithms re-normalize the weights on the paths so that the total outflow out of each node is one again. Finally we discuss the use of regular expressions for speeding up the kernel and re-normalization computation. In particular we rewrite the multiplicative algorithms that predict as well as the best pruning of a series parallel graph in terms of efficient kernel computations."

As a special case, the kernels give a new approach to applying kernel-based learning algorithms to discrete data.

Several works have been done to derive kernels from probability distributions, e.g., the Fisher kernel. However, a general methodology to design a kernel is not fully developed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe propose a reasonable way of designing a kernel when objects are generated from latent variable models (e.g., HMM). First of all, a joint kernel is designed for complete data which include both visible and hidden variables. Then a marginalized kernel for visible data is obtained by taking the expectation with respect to hidden variables. We will show that the Fisher kernel is a special case of marginalized kernels, which gives another viewpoint to the Fisher kernel theory. Although our approach can be applied to any object, we particularly derive several marginalized kernels useful for biological sequences (e.g., DNA and proteins). The effectiveness of marginalized kernels is illustrated in the task of classifying bacterial gyrase subunit B (gyrB) amino acid sequences."

We show that rational kernels can be computed efficiently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. We also describe several general families of positive definite symmetric rational kernels. These general kernels can be combined with Support Vector Machines to form efficient and powerful techniques for spoken-dialog classification: highly complex kernels become easy to design and implement and lead to substantial improvements in the classification accuracy. We also show that the string kernels considered in applications to computational biology are all specific instances of rational kernels."

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner."

Attempts to incorporate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic indexing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such similarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain positive results."

Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on computation time and programming effort."

The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel Gaussian DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g., speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique."

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field."
