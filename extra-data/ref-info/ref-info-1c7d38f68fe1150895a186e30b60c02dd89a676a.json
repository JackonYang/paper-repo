                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

                "text": "Chapter 6 puts the information covered to that point into direct application. The authors first discuss in some detail a crop identification and acreage estimation case study. This is followed by rather brief discussions of five selected management problems: large area land use inventory and forest, snow-cover, geologic, and water-temperature mapping. Serious students will wish to supplement these with studies of problems pertinent to their own areas of special interest. While much of the information presented is valuable, I see little justification for the final chapter since most of the material in it could well have been worked into other parts of the text. A few imperfections merit comment. Reproduction of some of the aerial-photographs and images does not meet the standards which were imposed on the drawings. For example, the images in Fig. 5-39 are difficult to interpret, although that problem may relate more to the small size of each wave band illustrated than to the quality of photographic reproduction. The areas shown in Fig. 1-7 to illustrate the three spectral regions are not the same scale; further, the same areas (with the same scale problem) are shown in Fig. 5-41. Fig. 6-13 contributes the little to an understanding of the selection or appearance of training areas; nor does Fig.-6-15 to-the selection of test areas. Three chapters have brief but useful summary sections. The other four would have benefited by a similar procedure. While the selection of terms to include in a glossary is a difficult task, a few which are encountered frequently in quantitative remote sensing were omitted, e.g., band ratioing, minimum Euclidean distance elassifier, maximum likelihood classifier smoothing, vector, etc. While there are savings in printing costs to have all color plates grouped on four pages, I found this system awkward to use and disruptive of comprehension. I was surprised, too, that answers to the questions posed after the various sections are not given. Individuals using the text on a self-study basis probably would not have a background adequate to verify their answers without such assistance. These, though, are relatively minor criticisms. Overall, this is one of the best sources of information that I have encountered on the subject of quantitative remote sensing. It would serve well as the textbook for courses at various levels and for students with a wide range of backgrounds. Professionals in the field of remote sensing will wish to add this volume \u2026"

                "text": "ion planning It may be possible to take a coarser view of the problem space, as though we could back off and see the general features while omitting the details. This is one form of planning (a different form than embodied in Heuristic DENDRAL, to be described shortly). We will call it abstraction to keep the terminology clear. In the terms of our paradigm of problem solving, abstraction can be achieved by defining a new set of problem-state descriptions, based on a language that is an abstrac34 APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTRY tion of the basic language in the sense that one problem-state description in the abstraction language corresponds to many problem-state descriptions in the basic language. The new view of the problem space now offers a diminished set of states and therefore reduces the complexity of the problem. Transformations for the abstraction language defme the connectivity of the abstracted space. If the problem solver can discover a path from initial state to goal state in the abstracted space, he has not solved the original problem but has established a plan. Each step of the plan then becomes a problem in the original space, but the combined complexity of all these problems may be less than the complexity of the original problem. Working backward For some problems the number of alternatives to be searched is fewer if we begin at the goal state and, running the transformations in reverse as it were, search for the initial state. This situation might be the case if there is only one goal state but a multitude of initial states. Working backward is a time-honored procedure in mathematics and logic. Of course it is of no use for problems in which the transformations are not reversible, or when the definition of goal state is in terms to which the transformations cannot apply, as with chess. One would be hard put to play chess by working backward from a definition of checkmate, looking for the initial board configuration. 3.2.2.2 Heuristic generation Generate and test If there is a procedure that can generate candidate solution, goal states in our present terminology, it may be possible to solve problems by the sequential enumeration and checking of potential solutions. This method is frequently called generate and test. Note that in this paradigm it is not the states of the problem space that are generated. Indeed there need not be a problem space of the sort we have been discussing. Here we need only a space of solutions that can be generated for consideration. This paradigm is thus fundamentally different from searching the space of problem states (state-space search). Analogs of the heuristic search methods described above apply to heuristic generation. Statistical information concerning the distribution of solutions (perhaps by categories defined in a \u201csecondary solution description language\u201d) may be used to guide generation, If some measure of goodness is computable from a proposed solution, then a hill-climbing procedure could be used to determine ways of modifying one proposal in appropriate ways. Similarly, if an abstracted description of, the set of solutions can be constructed, it may be possible to search first for the\u2019correct solution class, and then search within that class. These methods do not exhaust the possibilities, but they provide enough structure for our discussion. 3.2.3 Multiple Sources of Knowledge Much more problem-solving power can be achieved if there is more than one source of information that can be used. For this reason purely syntactic problem solvers are inherently less powerful than those that employ semantic information as well. The secret ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 35 is not that semantic information is more important, but that two sources of guidance are better than one. Jigsaw puzzles are an appropriate image to make this procedure clear. The problem of finding the one arrangement of all the pieces that yields the desired picture may be a very difficult and large combinatorial task. If the puzzle were done with the pieces face down, analogous to having only the \u201csyntactic\u201d information of piece contours, the true difficulty of the problem would become apparent. If all the pieces were of the same shape, squares or hexagons, the problem could only be solved from the \u201csemantic\u201d information of colors and pictured objects and would also be very difficult. Jigsaw puzzles are tractable because both these sources of information are available and can be played off against one another. In terms of the paradigm of state-space search, different sources of information correspond to different problem-state languages. Several of the search heuristics defmed above rely on these secondary languages. Hill climbing needs a language in which to define its gradient of \u201cwarmth,\u201d and statistically guided search is based on a rather general but blurry-visioned search for descriptors that have some correlational information. Abstraction planning is another way of bringing to bear different views of the problem space. On a more general level, apart from any of these methods, is the representation problem. A problem has in general many possible representations. It may be possible to choose two or more (rather than just one) in such a way that progress in one statespace search can be transferred to another. Thus those transitions that are difficult in one representation may be bypassed by using a second and vice versa. In the context of heuristic generation, multiple sources of knowledge have the effect of limiting generation to the intersection of the solution sets delimited by each source."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

In handwritten character recognition, one of the best techniques for addressing this problem is the tangent distance method of Simard, LeCun and Denker (1993). Jain, et al. (1993a; 1993b) introduce a new technique-dynamic reposing--that also addresses this problem. Dynamic reposing iteratively learns a neural network and then reposes the examples in an effort to maximize the predicted output values. New models are trained and new poses computed until models and poses converge. This paper compares dynamic reposing to the tangent distance method on the task of predicting the biological activity of musk compounds. In a 20-fold cross-validation, dynamic reposing attains 91% correct compared to 79% for the tangent distance method, 75% for a neural network with standard poses, and 75% for the nearest neighbor method."

We present a novel technique, Compass, that removes a major obstacle to accurate prediction by automatically selecting conformations and alignments of molecules without the benefit of a characterized active site. The technique combines explicit representation of molecular shape with neural network learning methods to produce highly predictive models, even across chemically distinct classes of molecules. We apply the method to predicting human perception of musk odor and show how the resulting models can provide graphical guidance for chemical modifications."

We use a benchmark problem of steroid binding affinity prediction to compare the performance of the method with that of two previous systems: CoMFA and a molecular similarity method. Compass predicts steroid affinities substantially more accurately than the others, which represent the state of the art.

The search is biased toward the low-energy regions of conformational space by choosing starting geometries for each step in the conformational search from among previously stored low-energy conformers. Tendencies of the search method to concentrate in certain regions of conformational space at the expense of others are reduced by uniform usage of stored structures as starting geometries and by using varying numbers or torsional rotations in each step. Tests of the procedure's ability to find all low-energy conformations of several acrylic, medium- and large-ring molecules are described. Direct comparisons of the method with Cartesian coordinate random methods and systematic internal coordinate grid searches are carried out with symmetrical and unsymmetrical molecules. The method makes it possible to carry out global conformational searches on symmetrical and unsymmetrical molecules having up to a dozen variable torsion angles."

The matrices were analyzed using a neural network pattern recognition technique and partial least squares statistics, with the results obtained compared to those achieved using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). The molecular series used in the study comprised 31 steroids. The resultant pattern recognition analysis showed clustering of compounds with high, intermediate, and low affinity into separate regions of the neuron output plots. The cross-validated correlation coefficients obtained from statistical analyses of the matrices against steroid binding data compared well with those achieved using CoMFA.

We applied the technique to a series of compounds assayed for 5-HT1A binding. A model was constructed from 20 compounds of two chemotypes and used to predict the affinities and bioactive conformation of 35 new compounds, most of which had new underlying scaffolds and/or functional groups. The model's mean error of prediction was 0.5 log units (essentially the assay resolution), even on quite divergent series. The predictions are supported by an interpretable hypothesis for the binding determinants of the receptor and the geometric relationships of the chemotypes."

                "text": "Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) is a promising new approach to structure/activity correlation. Its characteristic features are (1) representation of ligand molecules by their steric and electrostatic fields, sampled at the intersections of a three-dimensional lattice, (2) a new \u2018field fit\u201d technique, allowing optimal mutual alignment within a series, by minimizing the RMS field differences between molecules, (3) data analysis by partial least squares (PLS), using cross-validation to maximize the likelihood that the results have predictive validity, and (4) graphic representation of results, as contoured three-dimensional coefficient plots. CoMFA is exemplified by analyses of the affinities of 21 varied steroids to corticosteroidand testosterone-binding globulins. Also described are the sensitivities of results to the nature of the field and the definition of the lattice and, for comparison, analyses of the same data using various combinations of other parameters. From these results, a set of ten steroid-binding affinity values unknown to us during the CoMFA analysis were well predicted. A major goal in chemical research is to predict the behavior of new molecules, using relationships derived from analysis of the properties of previously tested molecules. Relationships derived primarily by empirical analysis of a data table, whose columns are numerical property values and whose rows are compounds, usually taking the form of a linear equation, are called quantitative structure/activity relationships (QSAR).I Especially in biological applications, it has long been agreed that the most relevant numerical property values would be shape-dependent. Work on comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) began 12 years ago with two additional observations: (1) at the molecular level, the interactions which produce an observed biological effect are usually non-covalent; and ( 2 ) molecular mechanics force fields, most of which treat noncovalent (non-bonded) interactions only as steric and electrostatic forces, can account precisely for a great variety of observed molecular properties.2 Thus it seems reasonable that a suitable sampling of the steric and electrostatic fields surrounding a set of ligand (drug) molecules might provide all the information necessary for understanding their observed biological properties. However, the emergence of a practical CoMFA methodology had to await a new method of data analysis, partial least squares (PLS),3 which can derive robust linear equations from tables having many more columns than rows, and a number of advances in the methodology of molecular graphics. Other \u201c3D-QSAR\u201d methodologies have been described. The molecular shape (MS) approaches, developed independently by Simon et aL4 and by H ~ p f i n g e r , ~ compare net, rather than location-dependent, differences in molecular connectivities, volumes, and/or fields. A second approach, the \u201cdistance geometry\u201d method of Crippen,6 provides validation of a \u201dsite-point\u201d hypothesis, a list of binding set coordinates and properties that must be proposed by the investigator. A prototype version of the CoMFA method is called \u201cDYLOMMS\u201d.7 In related work, for exploring binding modes of ligands to receptors, Goodford* advocates the display of probe-interaction \u201cgrids\u201d, similar to thme used in CoMFA, while Hansch, Blaney, Langridge, et aL9 have shown the complementarity of QSAR and molecular graphics in understanding enzyme inhibitor data. Below we describe the main features of the CoMFA approach, exemplifying its use by analyzing the binding affinities of 21 varied steroid structures to human corticosteroid-binding globulins (CBG) and testosterone-binding globulins10 (TBG). In this series, the comparative rigidity of the steroid nucleus allows the conformational variable to be neglected, and the in vitro, particularly simple, character of the test system minimizes the importance of nonreceptor-related, hence non-shape-related, compound differences on the experimental observations.\u201d We then investigated the *Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed. 0002-7863/88/15 10-5959$01.50/0 sensitivity of the excellent results obtained to critical model assumptions. For the purpose of comparison, we have also analysed these steroid binding data using both classical and other \u201dmolecular shape\u201d parameters, in various combinations. Finally, toward the end of this work, we were informed of additional corticosteroid binding data,12 and thus were able to test the ability of our model to predict the binding constants of ten more, structurally diverse, steroids. Computational Methods CoMFA Methodology. The overall data flow of a CoMFA analysis appears in Figure I . Its top two panels show how the data table is constructed from the field values at the lattice intersections. These automatically calculated parameters are the energies of steric (van der Waals 6-12) and electrostatic (Coulombic, with a 1 / r dielectric) interaction between the compound of interest, and a \u201cprobe atom\u201d placed at the various intersections of a regular three-dimensional lattice, large enough to surround all of the compounds in the series, and with a 2.0 A separation between lattice point unless otherwise stated. The van der Waals A / B values were taken from the standard Tripos force field\u201d and the atomic charges were calculated by the method of Gasteiger and Mar~i l i . \u2019~ Unless stated otherwise, the probe atom had the van der Waals properties of sp3 carbon and a charge of +1.0.

                "text": "We present the development of a force field for simulation of nucleic acids and proteins. Our approach began by obtaining equilibrium bond lengths and angles from microwave, neutron diffraction, and prior molecular mechanical calculations, torsional constants from microwave, NMR, and molecular mechanical studies, nonbonded parameters from crystal packing calculations, and atomic charges from the fit of a partial charge model to electrostatic potentials calculated by ab initio quantum mechanical theory. The parameters were then refined with molecular mechanical studies on the structures and energies of model compounds. For nucleic acids, we focused on methyl ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, deoxyadenosine, dimethyl phosphate, 9-methylguanine-l-methylcytosine hydrogen-bonded complex, 9-methyladenine-l-methylthymine hydrogen-bonded complex, and 1,3-dimethyluracil base-stacked dimer. Bond, angle, torsional, nonbonded, and hydrogen-bond parameters were varied to optimize the agreement between calculated and experimental values for sugar pucker energies and structures, vibrational frequencies of dimethyl phosphate and tetrahydrofuran, and energies for base pairing and base stacking. For proteins, we focused on 4>,'lt maps of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides, hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the various protein polar groups, and energy refinement calculations on insulin. Unlike the models for hydrogen bonding involving nitrogen and oxygen electron donors, an adequate description of sulfur hydrogen bonding required explicit inclusion of lone pairs. There are two fundamental problems in simulating the struc\u00ad tural and energetic properties of molecules: the first is how to choose an analytical been placed E(R) which correctly describes the energy of the system in terms of its 3N degrees of freedom. The second is how the simulation can search or span conforma\u00ad tional space (R) in order to answer questions posed by the scientist interested in the properties of the system. For complex systems, solution to the first problem are an es\u00ad sential first step in attacking the second problem, and thus, considerable effort has been placed in developing analytical functions that are simple enough to allow one to simulate the properties of complex molecules yet accurate enough to obtain meaningful estimates for structures and energies. In the case of the structures and thermodynamic stabilities of saturated hydrocarbons in inert solvents or the gas phase, the first problem has been essentially solved by molecular mechanics ap\u00ad proaches of Allinger, I Ermer and Lifson,2 and their co-workers. However, for polar and ionic molecules in condensed phases, unsolved questions remain as to the best form of the analytical function E(R). In the area of proteins and peptides, seminal work has come from the Scheraga 3 and Lifson 4 schools. The Scheraga group has used both crystal packing (intermolecular) and con\u00ad formational properties of peptides to arrive at force fields ECEPP, UNECEPP, and EPEN for modeling structural and thermodynamic properties of peptides and proteins. Levitt, using the energy refinement software developed in the Lifson group, has proposed a force field for proteins based on calculations on lysozyme,S and Gelin and Karplus have adapted this software along with many parameters from the Scheraga studies to do molecular dynamics"

Incorporation of supplementary CH3 or CH2 groups into the basic musk skeleton of type G only slightly modifies the global shape of the molecule but leads to densely packed structures of enhanced lipophilicity. For the construction of these highly substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalenes, new annulation sequences (intramolecular mono- and dialkylations; see Schemes 3,6, and 8) have been developed and, in certain cases, the design of the target molecules was dictated by both structure-activity-relationship and synthetic considerations (e.g.46 and 47, Scheme 6). This work also presents an original solution to an analytical problem: the distinction between a C2- and a Cs-symmetrical aromatic hydrocarbon (viz.71 and 72) by conversion into a [Cr(CO)3arene]complex."
