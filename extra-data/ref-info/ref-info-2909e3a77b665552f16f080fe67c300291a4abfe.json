In our approach, patch regions from a sample image or video are transformed and copied to the output and then stitched together along optimal seams to generate a new (and typically larger) output. In contrast to other techniques, the size of the patch is not chosen a-priori, but instead a graph cut technique is used to determine the optimal patch region for any given offset between the input and output texture. Unlike dynamic programming, our graph cut technique for seam optimization is applicable in any dimension. We specifically explore it in 2D and 3D to perform video texture synthesis in addition to regular image synthesis. We present approximative offset search techniques that work well in conjunction with the presented patch size optimization. We show results for synthesizing regular, random, and natural images and videos. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to interactively merge different images to generate new scenes."

Also central to the framework is a suite of interactive tools that allow the user to specify a variety of high-level image objectives, either globally across the image, or locally through a painting-style interface. Image objectives are applied independently at each pixel location and generally involve a function of the pixel values (such as \"maximum contrast\") drawn from that same location in the set of source images. Typically, a user applies a series of image objectives iteratively in order to create a finished composite. The power of this framework lies in its generality; we show how it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including \"selective composites\" (for instance, group photos in which everyone looks their best), relighting, extended depth of field, panoramic stitching, clean-plate production, stroboscopic visualization of movement, and time-lapse mosaics."

Multi-camera scene reconstruction is a natural generalization of the stereo matching problem. However, it is much more difficult than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about visibility. In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded excellent results for stereo, namely energy minimization via graph cuts. We first give an energy minimization formulation of the multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities. As the energy function is NP-hard to minimize exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations where voxel coloring can be used, which is a large and natural class. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

Existing algorithms either produce a rough \"stitch\" that cannot deal with common artifacts, or require user input. This paper presents methods for dealing with two artifacts that often occur in practice. Our first contribution is a method for dealing with objects that move between different views of a dynamic scene. If such moving objects are left in, they will appear blurry and \"ghosted\". Treating such regions as nodes in a graph, we use a vertex cover algorithm to selectively remove all but one instance of each object. Our second contribution is a method for continuously adjusting exposure across multiple images in order to eliminate visible shifts in brightness or hue. We compute exposure corrections on a block-by block basis, then smoothly interpolate the parameters using a spline to get spatially continuous exposure adjustment. Our enhancements, combined with previously published techniques for automatic image stitching, result in a high-quality automated stitcher that exhibits far fewer artifacts than existing software."

We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This \"Blobworld\" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The epitome of an image is its miniature, condensed version containing the essence of the textural and shape properties of the image. As opposed to previously used simple image models, such as templates or basis functions, the size of the epitome is considerably smaller than the size of the image or object it represents, but the epitome still contains most constitutive elements needed to reconstruct the image. A collection of images often shares an epitome, e.g., when images are a few consecutive frames from a video sequence, or when they are photographs of similar objects. A particular image in a collection is defined by its epitome and a smooth mapping from the epitome to the image pixels. When the epitomic representation is used within a hierarchical generative model, appropriate inference algorithms can be derived to extract the epitome from a single image or a collection of images and at the same time perform various inference tasks, such as image segmentation, motion estimation, object removal and super-resolution."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

Such clustering requirements are generic to a number of problems in computer vision.We extend existing techniques for affine-invariant clustering, and show that the new distance metric outperforms existing approximations to affine invariant distance computation, particularly under large transformations. In addition, we incorporate prior probabilities on the transformation parameters. This further regularizes the solution, mitigating a rare but serious tendency of the existing solutions to diverge. For the particular special case of corresponding point sets we demonstrate that the affine invariant measure we introduced may be obtained in closed form.As an application of these ideas we demonstrate that the faces of the principal cast of a feature film can be generated automatically using clustering with appropriate invariance. This is a very demanding test as it involves detecting and clustering over tens of thousands of images with the variances including changes in viewpoint, lighting, scale and expression."

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."
