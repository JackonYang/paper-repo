It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task."

We evaluate a variety of measures of semantic relatedness when applied to word sense disambiguation by carrying out experiments using the English lexical sample data of SENSEVAL-2.

We compare the results of these tests with those produced by WordNet-based similarity measures. One of the benchmarks is Miller and Charles' list of 30 noun pairs to which human judges had assigned similarity measures. We correlate these measures with those computed by several NLP systems. The 30 pairs can be traced back to Rubenstein and Goodenough's 65 pairs, which we have also studied. Our Roget's-based system gets correlations of .878 for the smaller and .818 for the larger list of noun pairs; this is quite close to the .885 that Resnik obtained when he employed humans to replicate the Miller and Charles experiment. We further evaluate our measure by using Roget's and WordNet to answer 80 TOEFL, 50 ESL and 300 Reader's Digest questions: the correct synonym must be selected amongst a group of four words. Our system gets 78.75%, 82.00% and 74.33% of the questions respectively."

The problem with using the first sense heuristic, aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account, is that it assumes some quantity of hand-tagged data. Whilst there are some hand-tagged corpora available for some languages, one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration. For example, one would expect a different predominant sense for star if one were looking at scientific astronomy reports compared with popular news. We present work on the use of the WordNet similarity package and a thesaurus automatically acquired from raw textual corpora to rank WordNet noun senses automatically. The results are promising when evaluated against the gold-standard provided by SemCor, giving us a theoretical WSD precision of 60% on an all-words task. Moreover, some of the ranking errors can be explained by differences in the corpus data used to produce the thesaurus compared to this gold-standard. Our experiments also show that the automatic ranking can be used to filter senses which are unseen or infrequent in the gold-standard."

An appealing perspective, aims to define senses in terms of their multilingual correspondences, an idea explored by several researchers, Dyvik (1998), Ide (1999), Resnik & Yarowsky (1999), and Chugur, Gonzalo & Verdejo (2002) but to date it has not been given any practical demonstration. This thesis is an empirical validation of these ideas of characterizing word meaning using cross-linguistic correspondences. The idea is that word meaning or word sense is quantifiable as much as it is uniquely translated in some language or set of languages. \nConsequently, we address the problem of WSD from a multilingual perspective; we expand the notion of context to encompass multilingual evidence. We devise a new approach to resolve word sense ambiguity in natural language, using a source of information that was never exploited on a large scale for WSD before. \nThe core of the work presented builds on exploiting word correspondences across languages for sense distinction. In essence, it is a practical and functional implementation of a basic idea common to research interest in defining word meanings in cross-linguistic terms. \nWe devise an algorithm, SALAAM for Sense Assignment Leveraging Alignment And Multilinguality, that empirically investigates the feasibility and the validity of utilizing translations for WSD. SALAAM is an unsupervised approach for word sense tagging of large amounts of text given a parallel corpus\u2014texts in translation\u2014and a sense inventory for one of the languages in the corpus. Using SALAAM, we obtain large amounts of sense annotated data in both languages of the parallel corpus, simultaneously. The quality of the tagging is rigorously evaluated for both languages of the corpora. \nThe automatic unsupervised tagged data produced by SALAAM is further utilized to bootstrap a supervised learning WSD system, in essence, combining supervised and unsupervised approaches in an intelligent way to alleviate the resources acquisition bottleneck for supervised methods. Essentially, SALAAM is extended as an unsupervised approach for WSD within a learning framework; in many of the cases of the words disambiguated, SALAAM coupled with the machine learning system rivals the performance of a canonical supervised WSD system that relies on human tagged data for training. \nRealizing the fundamental role of similarity for SALAAM, we investigate different dimensions of semantic similarity as it applies to verbs since they are relatively more complex than nouns, which are the focus of the previous evaluations. We design a human judgment experiment to obtain human ratings on verbs' semantic similarity. The obtained human ratings are cast as a reference point for comparing different automated similarity measures that crucially rely on various sources of information. Finally, a cognitively salient model integrating human judgments in SALAAM is proposed as a means of improving its performance on sense disambiguation for verbs in particular and other word types in general."

Much of the research in natural language understanding in the last twenty yearscan be thought of as attempts to characterize and represent context and then derive interpretationsthat\ufb01t best with that context. Typically, this research was heavy with AI, taking context to be nothing lessthan a complete conceptual understanding of the preceding utterances. This was reasonable, as suchan understanding of a text was often the main task anyway. However, there are many text-processingtasksthatrequireonlya partialunderstandingofthetext, andhencea \u2018lighter\u2019representationofcontextis suf\ufb01cient. In this paper, we examine the idea oflexical chains as such a representation. We showhow they can be constructed by means of WordNet, and how they can be applied in one particularlinguistic task: the detection and correction of malapropisms.A malapropism is the confounding of an intended word with another word of similar sound orsimilar spelling that has a quite different and malapropos meaning, e.g., an ingenuous [for ingenious]machine forpeelingoranges. In thisexample, there isaone-letterdifference betweenthe malapropismand the correct word. Ignorance, or a simple typing mistake, might cause such errors. However, sinceingenuous is a correctly spelled word, traditional spelling checkers cannot detect this kind of mistake.In section 4, we will propose an algorithm for detecting and correcting malapropisms that is based onthe construction of lexical chains."

Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Pedersen for being so thorough and patient, and for seeing me through this research till the end. I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Gallian and Dr. Turner, for going over the thesis so carefully and for their insightful suggestions. I would also like to thank Bano, whose work we built upon and who was full of ideas throughout. I thank my fellow NLP group members \u2013 Saif, Bridget and Amruta \u2013 for their ideas and suggestions and my colleague Navdeep for proofreading and providing her thoughts on the thesis. I am grateful to Jason Rennie for providing a wonderful interface to WordNet and to Mona Diab for her feedback on the measures. I am also grateful to Diana Inkpen for her insights on the Vector measure. Abstract Humans are able to judge the relatedness of words (concepts) relatively easily, and are often in general agreement as to how related two words are. For example, few would disagree that \" pencil \" is more related to \" paper \" than it is to \" boat \". Miller and Charles (1991) attribute this human perception of relatedness to the overlap of contextual representations of words in the human mind, and there is at least some understanding of how humans are able to perform this task. However, it remains an open question as to how to create automatic computational methods that assign relatedness values or scores to pairs of concepts. A number of measures of relatedness have been proposed, most of them relying on information taken from the lexical database WordNet, and possibly augmented with corpus based statistics. In this thesis we study a number of such measures, and offer various refinements to those proposed We then compare these measures along with three others in the context of a human relatedness study and in word sense disambiguation experiments. We find that the measures of Jiang and Conrath (1997) and Banerjee and Pedersen \u2026"
