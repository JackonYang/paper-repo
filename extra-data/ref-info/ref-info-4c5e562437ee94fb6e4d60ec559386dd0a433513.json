If the convex hulls of the two sets do not intersect, the sets can be strictly separated by a plane. Such a plane can be constructed by the Motzkin-Schoenberg error-correction procedure or by linear programming. More often than not, however, the convex hulls of the two point sets do intersect, in which case strict separation by a plane is not possible any more. One may then resort to separation by more than one plane. In this paper, we show how two sets can be strictly separated by one or more planes or surfaces (nonlinear manifolds) via linear programming. A computer program that implements the present method has been written and successfully tested on a number of real problems."

The patterns are usually represented by points in a Euclidean space. One way to achieve separation is to construct a plane or a nonlinear surface such that one set of patterns lies on one side of the plane or the surface, and the other set of patterns on the other side. Recently, it has been shown that linear and ellipsoidal separation may be achieved by nonlinear programming. In this work it is shown that both linear and nonlinear separation may be achieved by linear programming."

This paper presents a linear programming formulation of discriminant function design which minimizes the same objective function as the \"fixed-increment\" adaptive method. With this formulation, as with the adaptive methods, weights which tend to minimize the number of classification errors are computed for both separable and nonseparable pattern sets, and not just for separable pattern sets as has been the emphasis in previous linear programming formulations."

Classical statistical applications have been joined recently by applications in the fields of management science and artificial intelligence. In a departure from the methodology of statistics, a series of proposals have appeared for capturing the goals of discriminant analysis in a collection of linear programming formulations. The evolution of these formulations has brought advances that have removed a number of initial shortcomings and deepened our understanding of how these models differ in essential ways from other familiar classes of LP formulations. We will demonstrate, however, that the full power of the LP discriminant analysis models has not been achieved, due to a previously undetected distortion that inhibits the quality of solutions generated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to eliminate this distortion and thereby increase the scope and flexibility of these models. We additionally show how these outcomes open the door to special model manipulations and simplifications, including the use of a successive goal method for establishing a series of conditional objectives to achieve improved discrimination."

Each element of the pattern sets is comprised of various scalar observations. In this paper, we use the diagnosis of breast cytology to demonstrate the applicability of this method to medical diagnosis and decision making. Each of 11 cytological characteristics of breast fine-needle aspirates reported to differ between benign and malignant samples was graded 1 to 10 at the time of sample collection. Nine characteristics were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant samples. Mathematically, these values for each sample were represented by a point in a nine-dimensional space of real variables. Benign points were separated from malignant ones by planes determined by linear programming. Correct separation was accomplished in 369 of 370 samples (201 benign and 169 malignant). In the one misclassified malignant case, the fine-needle aspirate cytology was so definitely benign and the cytology of the excised cancer so definitely malignant that we believe the tumor was missed on aspiration. Our mathematical method is applicable to other medical diagnostic and decision-making problems."

Two schemes were computer-generated decision trees and two were user generated. Eleven cytologic characteristics described in the literature as being useful in distinguishing benign from malignant breast aspirates were assessed on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being closest to that described as benign and 10 to that described as malignant. The original computer-generated dichotomous decision tree gave 6 false negatives and 12 false positives on the data set; another tree generated from the current data improved performance slightly, with 5 false negatives and 10 false positives. Maximum diagnostic overlap occurred at the cut-point of the original dichotomous tree. The insertion of a third node evaluating additional parameters resulted in one false negative and seven false positives. This performance was matched by summing the scores of the eight characteristics that individually were most effective in separating benign from malignant. We conclude that, while statistically designed, computer-generated dichotomous decision trees identify a starting sequence for applying cytologic characteristics to distinguish between benign and malignant breast aspirates, modifications based on human expert knowledge may result in schemes that improve diagnostic performance."
