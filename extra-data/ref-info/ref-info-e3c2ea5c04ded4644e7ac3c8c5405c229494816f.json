Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

Our scheme includes a morphology and heuristics based segmentation algorithm, a training algorithm that can adapt itself with the changing dictionary, and a modified Viterbi algorithm which searches for the (l+1)th globally best path based on the previous l best paths.

In what we believe is a fresh perspective on handwriting recognition, approaches to recognition are characterized as forming a continuous spectrum based on the visual complexity of the unit of recognition employed and an attempt is made to interpret well-known paradigms of word recognition in this framework. An overview of features, methodologies, representations, and matching techniques employed by holistic approaches is presented."

Since traditional handwriting recognizers based on optical character recognition (OCR) do not perform well on historical documents, recently a holistic word recognition approach has gained in popularity as an attractive and more straightforward solution (Lavrenko et\u00a0al. in proc. document Image Analysis for Libraries (DIAL\u201904), pp. 278\u2013287, 2004). Such techniques attempt to recognize words based on scalar and profile-based features extracted from whole word images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to holistic word recognition for historical handwritten manuscripts based on matching word contours instead of whole images or word profiles. The new method consists of robust extraction of closed word contours and the application of an elastic contour matching technique proposed originally for general shapes (Adamek and O\u2019Connor in IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 5:2004). We demonstrate that multiscale contour-based descriptors can effectively capture intrinsic word features avoiding any segmentation of words into smaller subunits. Our experiments show a recognition accuracy of 83%, which considerably exceeds the performance of other systems reported in the literature."

Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts, the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set. With an average precision of 72%, a combination of features outperforms competing techniques in speed and precision."

The image region that corresponds to the query image region is retrieved by solving the matching problem of these sequences. Applying the eigenspace method to the slit images enables us to solve the matching problem efficiently. Moreover, using dynamic time warping (DTW) further improves the results. Our method has higher accuracy than the simple template matching method, and it has far higher efficiency in computational cost."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

The only assumption made about the data is that it is written in English. This allows the application of statistical language models in order to improve the performance of our system. Several experiments have been performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from 10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent for multiple writer data). Our approach is described in detail and compared with other methods presented in the literature to deal with the same problem. An experimental setup to correctly deal with unconstrained text recognition is proposed."

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on off-line printed and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, which leads to a significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes."

This algorithm is part of the A2iA INTERCHEQUE recognition system. The algorithm starts from images of handwritten words which have been automatically segmented from binary check images. After finding the lower-case zone on the complete amount, words are slant corrected and then segmented into graphemes. Then, features are extracted from the graphemes, and the feature vectors are vector quantized resulting in a sequence of symbols for each word. Likelihoods of all word classes are computed by a set of HMMs, which have been previously trained using either the Viterbi algorithm or the Baum?Welch algorithm. The various parameters of the system have been identified and their importance evaluated. Results have been obtained on large real-life data bases of French handwritten checks. The HMM-based system has been shown to outperform a holistic word recognizer and another HMM-type word recognizer from the A2iA INTERCHEQUE recognition system. Word recognition rates of about 89% for the 26-word vocabulary relevant for legal amount recognition on French bank checks have been obtained. More recently, a Neural Network?HMM hybrid has been designed, which produces even better recognition rates."

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."
