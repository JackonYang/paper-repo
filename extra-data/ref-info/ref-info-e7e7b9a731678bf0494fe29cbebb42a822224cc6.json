We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression."

However, in many cases, there already exists a database (DB) with schema related to the desired output, and records related to the expected input text. We present a conditional random field (CRF) that aligns tokens of a given DB record and its realization in text. The CRF model is trained using only the available DB and unlabeled text with generalized expectation criteria. An annotation of the text induced from inferred alignments is used to train an information extractor. We evaluate our method on a citation extraction task in which alignments between DBLP database records and citation texts are used to train an extractor. Experimental results demonstrate an error reduction of 35% over a previous state-of-the-art method that uses heuristic alignments."

In this paper, we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our novel framework unies and can exploit several kinds of task specic constraints. The experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning, and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks."

Several recent papers demonstrate joint inference between the segmentation of entity mentions and their de-duplication, however, they have various weaknesses: inference information flows only in one direction, the number of uncertain hypotheses is severely limited, or the subtasks are only loosely coupled. This paper presents a highly-coupled, bi-directional approach to joint inference based on efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in a relational conditional random field. The model is specified with our new probabilistic programming language that leverages imperative constructs to define factor graph structure and operation. Experimental results show that our approach provides a dramatic reduction in error while also running faster than the previous state-of-the-art system."

CRFs are log-linear, allowing the incorporation of arbitrary features into the model. To train on unlabeled data, we require unsupervised estimation methods for log-linear models; few exist. We describe a novel approach, contrastive estimation. We show that the new technique can be intuitively understood as exploiting implicit negative evidence and is computationally efficient. Applied to a sequence labeling problem---POS tagging given a tagging dictionary and unlabeled text---contrastive estimation outperforms EM (with the same feature set), is more robust to degradations of the dictionary, and can largely recover by modeling additional features."

However, information in text form, such as MEDLINE records, remains a greatly underutilized source of biological information. We have begun a research effort aimed at automatically mapping information from text sources into structured representations, such as knowledge bases. Our approach to this task is to use machine-learning methods to induce routines for extracting facts from text. We describe two learning methods that we have applied to this task--a statistical text classification method, and a relational learning method--and our initial experiments in learning such information-extraction routines. We also present an approach to decreasing the cost of learning information-extraction routines by learning from \"weakly\" labeled training data."

The proposed method does not require any annotated data or aligned corpora. Instead, it is bootstrapped using a simple resource -- a romanization table. We show that this resource, when used in conjunction with constraints, can efficiently identify transliteration pairs. We evaluate the proposed method on transliterating English NEs to three different languages - Chinese, Russian and Hebrew. Our experiments show that constraint driven learning can significantly outperform existing unsupervised models and achieve competitive results to existing supervised models."

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks."

The power in relational models is in their repeated structure and tied parameters; at issue is how to define these structures in a powerful and flexible way. Rather than using a declarative language, such as SQL or first-order logic, we advocate using an imperative language to express various aspects of model structure, inference, and learning. By combining the traditional, declarative, statistical semantics of factor graphs with imperative definitions of their construction and operation, we allow the user to mix declarative and procedural domain knowledge, and also gain significant efficiencies. We have implemented such imperatively defined factor graphs in a system we call FACTORIE, a software library for an object-oriented, strongly-typed, functional language. In experimental comparisons to Markov Logic Networks on joint segmentation and coreference, we find our approach to be 3-15 times faster while reducing error by 20-25%\u2014achieving a new state of the art."

Using data from a small treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers for predicting the next action of the parser are constructed. The accuracy of a classifier as such is evaluated on held-out data derived from the treebank, and its performance as a parser guide is evaluated by parsing the held-out portion of the treebank. The evaluation shows that memory-based learning gives a significant improvement over a previous probabilistic model based on maximum conditional likelihood estimation and that the inclusion of lexical features improves the accuracy even further."

We start with an unlexicalized PCFG as a baseline model, which is enriched to the level of Collins' Model 2 by adding lexicalization and subcategorization. The lexicalized sister-head model and a bigram model are also tested, to deal with the flatness of the French Treebank. The bigram model achieves the best performance: 81% constituency F-score and 84% dependency accuracy. All lexicalized models outperform the unlexicalized baseline, consistent with probabilistic parsing results for English, but contrary to results for German, where lexicalization has only a limited effect on parsing performance."

This paper argues that autonomously \"Semantifying Wikipedia\" is the best way to solve the problem. We choose Wikipedia as an initial data source, because it is comprehensive, not too large, high-quality, and contains enough manually-derived structure to bootstrap an autonomous, self-supervised process. We identify several types of structures which can be automatically enhanced in Wikipedia (e.g., link structure, taxonomic data, infoboxes, etc.), and we describea prototype implementation of a self-supervised, machine learning system which realizes our vision. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the high precision of our system's extracted data - in one case equaling that of humans."

However, learning parameters in these models is difficult because computing the gradients require expensive inference routines. In this paper we propose an online algorithm that instead learns preferences over hypotheses from the gradients between the atomic steps of inference. Although there are a combinatorial number of ranking constraints over the entire hypothesis space, a connection to the frameworks of sampled convex programs reveals a polynomial bound on the number of rankings that need to be satisfied in practice. We further apply ideas of passive aggressive algorithms to our update rules, enabling us to extend recent work in confidenceweighted classification to structured prediction problems. We compare our algorithm to structured perceptron, contrastive divergence, and persistent contrastive divergence, demonstrating substantial error reductions on two real-world problems (20% over contrastive divergence)."

Making complex decisions in real world problems often involves assigning values to sets of interdependent variables where the expressive dependency structure can influence, or even dictate, what assignments are possible. However, incorporating nonlocal depcndencies in a probabilistic model can lead to intractable training and inference. This paper presents Constraints Conditional Models (CCMs), a framework that augments probabilistic models with declarative constraints as a way to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training. We further show that declarative constraints can be used to take advantage of unlabeled data when training the probabilistic model."

SampleRank is a rank-based learning framework that alleviates this problem by updating the parameters during inference. Most semi-supervised learning algorithms also perform full inference on at least one instance before each parameter update. We extend SampleRank to semi-supervised learning in order to circumvent this computational bottleneck. Different approaches to incorporate unlabeled data and prior knowledge into this framework are explored. When evaluated on a standard information extraction dataset, our method significantly outperforms the supervised method, and matches results of a competing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approach."

This is accomplished by using generalized expectation criteria to express a preference for parameter settings in which the model\u2019s distribution on unlabeled data matches a target distribution. We induce target conditional probability distributions of labels given features from both annotated feature occurrences in context and adhoc feature majority label assignment. The use of generalized expectation criteria allows for a dramatic reduction in annotation time by shifting from traditional instance-labeling to feature-labeling, and the methods presented outperform traditional CRF training and other semi-supervised methods when limited human effort is available."

                "text": "XML is quickly becoming the de facto standard for data exchange over the Internet. This is creating a new set of data management requirements involving XML, such as the need to store and query XML documents. Researchers have proposed using relational database systems to satisfy these requirements by devising ways to \"shred\" XML documents into relations, and translate XML queries into SQL queries over these relations. However, a key issue with such an approach, which has largely been ignored in the research literature, is how (and whether) the ordered XML data model can be efficiently supported by the unordered relational data model. This paper shows that XML's ordered data model can indeed be efficiently supported by a relational database system. This is accomplished by encoding order as a data value. We propose three order encoding methods that can be used to represent XML order in the relational data model, and also propose algorithms for translating ordered XPath expressions into SQL using these encoding methods. Finally, we report the results of an experimental study that investigates the performance of the proposed order encoding methods on a workload of ordered XML queries and updates."

In relational data-bases, accurate deduplication for records of one type is often dependent on the decisions made for records of other types. Whereas nearly all previous approaches have merged records of different types independently, this work models these inter-dependencies explicitly to collectively deduplicate records of multiple types. We construct a conditional random field model of deduplication that captures these relational dependencies, and then employ a novel relational partitioning algorithm to jointly deduplicate records. For two citation matching datasets, we show that collectively deduplicating paper and venue records results in up to a 30% error reduction in venue deduplication, and up to a 20% error reduction in paper deduplication."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
