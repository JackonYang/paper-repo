As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

When an enhanced version of this neural net state machine is connected through a common error term to an external analog stack memory, the combination can be interpreted as a neural net pushdown automata. The neural net finite state machine is given the primitives, push and POP, and is able to read the top of the stack. Through a gradient descent learning rule derived from the common error function, the hybrid network learns to effectively use the stack actions to manipulate the stack memory and to learn simple contextfree grammars."
