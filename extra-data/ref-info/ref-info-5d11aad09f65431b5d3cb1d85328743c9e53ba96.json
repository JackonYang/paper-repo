They have been revised by the author but they reflect, apart from minor changes, the lectures as they were delivered. The subject-matter, as the title suggests, is the role of error in logics, or in the physical implementation of logics\u2014\u2013in automatasynthesis. Error is viewed, therefore, not as an extraneous and misdirected or misdirecting accident, but as an essential part of the process under consideration\u2014\u2013its importance in the synthesis of automata being fully comparable to that of the factor which is normally considered, the intended and correct logical structure. Our present treatment of error is unsatisfactory and ad hoc. It is the author\u2019s conviction, voiced over many years, that error should be treated by thermodynamical methods, and be the subject of a thermodynamical theory, as information has been, by the work of L. Szilard and C. E. Shannon (cf. 5.2). The present treatment falls far short of achieving this, but it assembles, it is hoped, some of the building materials, which will have to enter into the final structure. The author wants to express his thanks to K. A. Brueckner and M. Gell-Mann, then at the University of Illinois, to whose discussions in 1951 he owes some important stimuli on this subject; to Dr. R. S. Pierce at the California Institute of Technology, on whose excellent notes this exposition is based; and to the California Institute of Technology, whose invitation to deliver these lectures combined with the very warm reception by the audience, caused him to write this paper in its present form, and whose cooperation in connection with the present publication is much appreciated."
