Our texture model is based on the statistical distribution of clustered filter responses. However, unlike previous 3D texton representations, we use rotationally invariant filters and cluster in an extremely low dimensional space. Having built a texton dictionary, we present a novel method of classifying a single image without requiring any a priori knowledge about the viewing or illumination conditions under which it was photographed. We argue that using rotationally invariant filters while clustering in such a low dimensional space improves classification performance and demonstrate this claim with results on all 61 textures in the Columbia-Utrecht database. We then proceed to show how texture models can be further extended by compensating for viewpoint changes using weak isotropy.The new clustering and classification methods are compared to those of Leung and Malik (ICCV 1999), Schmid (CVPR 2001) and Cula and Dana (CVPR 2001), which are the current state-of-the-art approaches."

Many real world surfaces such as skin, fur, gravel, etc. exhibit fine-scale geometric surface detail. Accordingly, variations in appearance with viewing and illumination direction may be quite complex due to local foreshortening, masking and shadowing. Representations of surface texture that support robust recognition must account for these effects. We construct a representation which captures the underlying statistical distribution of features in the image texture as well as the variations in this distribution with viewing and illumination direction. The representation combines clustering to learn characteristic image features and principle components analysis to reduce the space of feature histograms. This representation is based on a core image set as determined by a quantitative evaluation of importance of individual images in the overall representation. The result is a compact representation and a recognition method where a single novel image of unknown viewing and illumination direction can be classified efficiently. The CUReT (Columbia-Utrecht reflectance and texture) database is used as a test set for evaluation of these methods."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

                "text": ". This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This theory combines \ufb01ltering theory and Markov random \ufb01eld modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clari\ufb01es many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a uni\ufb01ed point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f . I / on a random \ufb01eld, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f . I / , given a set of observed texture examples. In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of \ufb01lters is selected from a general \ufb01lter bank to capture features of the texture, these \ufb01lters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the \ufb01ltered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f . I / . This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p . I / , which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p . I / is considered as an estimate of f . I / . This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose \ufb01lters from a general \ufb01lter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random \ufb01elds And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random \ufb01eld (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p . I / , thus the model is veri\ufb01ed by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

It can be used to produce solid textures for creating textured 3-d objects without the distortions inherent in texture mapping. It can also be used to synthesize texture mixtures, images that look a bit like each of several digitized samples. The approach is based on a model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful tool for graphics applications."

In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures than do previous techniques."

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of \"generic\" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the \"generic\" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of \"spatial-frequency\" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture \"texture-like\" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for \"textured\" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization."

Our method follows the texture recognition work of De Bonet and Viola (1998). We use feature vectors which capture the joint occurrence of local features at multiple resolutions. The distribution of feature vectors for a set of training images of an object class is estimated by clustering the data and then forming a mixture of Gaussian models. The mixture model is further refined by determining which clusters are the most discriminative for the class and retaining only those clusters. After the model is learned, test images are classified by computing the likelihood of their feature vectors with respect to the model. We present promising results in applying our technique to face detection and car detection."

We fit the BRDF measurements to two recent models to obtain a BRDF parameter database. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. Finally, we present a BTF (bidirectional texture function) database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions. Each of these unique databases has important implications for a variety of vision algorithms and each is made publicly available."

It is based on the emulation of simple but rather carefully chosen image intensity statistics. The resulting texture models are compact and no longer require the example image from which they were derived. They make explicit some structural aspects of the textures and the modeling allows knitting together different textures with convincingly looking transition zones. As textures are seldom flat, it is important to also model 3D effects when textures change under changing viewpoint. The simulation of such changes is supported by the model, assuming examples for the different viewpoints are given."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
