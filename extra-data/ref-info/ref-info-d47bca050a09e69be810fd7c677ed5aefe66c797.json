The proposed method, which uses simple properties of vanishing points, is divided into two steps. In the first step, the intrinsic parameters of each camera, that is, the focal length and the location of the intersection between the optical axis and the image plane, are recovered from a single image of a cube. In the second step, the extrinsic parameters of a pair of cameras, that is, the rotation matrix and the translation vector which describe the rigid motion between the coordinate systems fixed in the two cameras are estimated from an image stereo pair of a suitable planar pattern. Firstly, by matching the corresponding vanishing points in the two images the rotation matrix can be computed, then the translation vector is estimated by means of a simple triangulation. The robustness of the method against noise is discussed, and the conditions for optimal estimation of the rotation matrix are derived. Extensive experimentation shows that the precision that can be achieved with the proposed method is sufficient to efficiently perform machine vision tasks that require camera calibration, like depth from stereo and motion from image sequence."

We then present an algorithm which uses edge features to robustly and accurately estimate relative rotations among multiple cameras given intrinsic calibration and approximate initial pose. The algorithm is linear both in the number of images and the number of features. We estimate the number and directions of vanishing points (VPs) with respect to each camera using a hybrid approach that combines the robustness of the Hough transform with the accuracy of expectation maximization. Matching and labeling methods identify unique VPs and correspond them across all cameras. Finally, a technique akin to bundle adjustment produces globally optimal estimates of relative camera rotations by bringing all VPs into optimal alignment. Uncertainty is modeled and used at every stage to improve accuracy. We assess the algorithm's performance on both synthetic and real data, and compare our results to those of semi-automated photogrammetric methods for a large set of real hemispherical images, using several consistency and error metrics."

In this article, a new method for detecting the three mutual orthogonal directions of such an environment is presented. Since realtime performance is not necessary for architectural application, like building reconstruction, a computationally more intensive approach was chosen. On the other hand, our approach is more rigorous than existing techniques, since the information given by the condition of three mutual orthogonal directions in the scene is identified and incorporated. Since knowledge about the camera geometry can be deduced from the vanishing points of three mutual orthogonal directions, we use this knowledge to reject falsely detected vanishing points.

We observe that most indoor and outdoor (city) scenes are designed on a Manhattan three-dimensional grid. This Manhattan grid structure puts strong constraints on the intensity gradients in the image. We demonstrate an algorithm for detecting the orientation of the user in such scenes based on Bayesian inference using statistics which we have learnt in this domain. Our algorithm requires a single input image and does not involve pre-processing stages such as edge detection and Hough grouping. We demonstrate strong experimental results on a range of indoor and outdoor images. We also show that estimating the grid structure makes it significantly easier to detect target objects which are not aligned with the grid."

Calibration constraints are provided by imaged scene structure, such as vanishing points of orthogonal directions, or rectified planes. In addition, constraints are available from the nature of the cameras and the motion between views. We formulate these constraints in terms of the geometry of the imaged absolute conic and its relationship to pole-polar pairs and the imaged circular points of planes. Three significant advantages result: first, constraints from scene features, camera characteristics and auto-calibration constraints provide linear equations in the elements of the image of the absolute conic. This means that constraints may easily be combined, and their solution is straightforward. Second, the degeneracies that occur when constraints are not independent may be easily identified. Lastly, the constraints from scene planes and image planes may be treated uniformly. Examples of various cases of constraint combination and degeneracy as well as computational techniques are presented."

It is assumed that the object in question can be modeled as a polyhedron where the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed as a linear function of a dimension vector, /spl lambda/. The reconstruction program takes as input a set of correspondences between features in the model and features in the image. From this information the program determines an appropriate projection model for the camera (scaled orthographic or perspective), the dimensions of the object, its pose relative to the camera and, in the case of perspective projection, the focal length of the camera. We demonstrate that this reconstruction task can be framed as an unconstrained optimization problem involving a small number of variables, no more than four, regardless of the number of parameters in the dimension vector."

Reducing the computational effort expended on each pixel reduces the time required to process an image by a constant factor. Selective processing on a limited portion of an image using a focus of attention can decrease overall computation by orders of magnitude. A fast pixel-based algorithm is developed that uses these principles to achieve fast extraction of lines for use in vision-guided mobile robot navigation. It builds upon an algorithm for extracting lines by grouping pixels with similar gradient orientation. It allows parametric control of computational resources required to extract lines with particular characteristics. >"

Indeed, lines are transformed into points, and for every point there is also a corresponding line. This paper presents a way of exploiting this special property, by the introduction of the cascaded Hough transform (CHT). This allows to look for the overall structure in an image, such as lines intersecting in a point or intersection points lying on a line. An interesting example is the detection of vanishing points and vanishing lines."
