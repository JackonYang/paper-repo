Despite this, the techniques actually in use for this task, as well as most of the techniques proposed by information retrieval (IR) researchers, make little use of knowledge about language. In this article we take the view that IR is an inference task, and that natural language processing (NLP) techniques can produce text representations that enable more accurate inferences about document content. By considering previous work on language\u2010based and knowledge\u2010based techniques from this perspective, some clear lessons are apparent, and we are applying these lessons in the ADRENAL (Augmented Document REtrieval using NAtural Language processing) project. Our initial experiments with hand\u2010coded representations suggest that using NLP\u2010produced representations can result in significant performance increases in IR systems, and also demonstrate the attention that must be given to representational issues in language\u2010oriented IR."

Most approaches to retrieving textual materials depend on a lexical match between words in users' requests and those in or assigned to database objects. Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use to describe the same object, lexical matching methods are necessarily incomplete and imprecise [5]. The latent semantic indexing approach tries to overcome these problems by automatically organizing text objects into a semantic structure more appropriate for matching user requests. This is done by taking advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with text objects. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by text-object matrix is decomposed into a set of about 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Terms and objects are represented by 50 to 150 dimensional vectors and matched against user queries in this \u201csemantic\u201d space. Initial tests find this completely automatic method widely applicable and a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to objects and services for which textual descriptions are available."

For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's favorite single word will result in 80-90 percent failure rates in many common situations. An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold improvements."
