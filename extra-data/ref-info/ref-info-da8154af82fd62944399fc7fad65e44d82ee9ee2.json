This paper describes the system design and evaluates several character extraction methods. Automatic text recognition from natural images receives a growing attention because of potential applications in image retrieval, robotics and intelligent transport system. Camera-based document analysis becomes a real possibility with the increasing resolution and availability of digital cameras. However, in the case of a blind person, finding the text region is the first important problem that must be addressed, because it cannot be assumed that the acquired image contains only characters. At first, our system tries to find in the image areas with small characters. Then it zooms into the found areas to retake higher resolution images necessary for character recognition. In the present paper, we propose four character-extraction methods based on connected components. We tested the effectiveness of our methods on the ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data. The performance of the different methods depends on character size. In the data, bigger characters are more prevalent and the most effective extraction method proves to be the sequence: Sobel edge detection, Otsu binarization, connected component extraction and rule-based connected component filtering."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

The proposed approach embeds multiresolution and multiscale edge detection, adaptive searching, color analysis, and affine rectification in a hierarchical framework for sign detection, with different emphases at each phase to handle the text in different sizes, orientations, color distributions and backgrounds. We use affine rectification to recover deformation of the text regions caused by an inappropriate camera view angle. The procedure can significantly improve text detection rate and optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. Instead of using binary information for OCR, we extract features from an intensity image directly. We propose a local intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations, followed by a Gabor transform to obtain local features, and finally a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method for feature selection. We have applied the approach in developing a Chinese sign translation system, which can automatically detect and recognize Chinese signs as input from a camera, and translate the recognized text into English."

Furthermore, such text often comprises only one or two lines, preventing the use of existing perspective rectification methods that were primarily designed for images of document pages. We propose an approach that reliably rectifies and subsequently recognizes individual lines of text. Our system, which includes novel algorithms for extraction of text from real-world scenery, perspective rectification, and binarization, has been rigorously tested on still imagery as well as on MPEG-2 video clips in real time."

The key ideas are twofold. One is segmentation of character and background by local/adaptive binarization of one of Cyan/Magenta/Yellow (CMY) color planes with the maximum breadth of histogram. The other is affine-invariant grayscale character recognition using global affine transformation (GAT) correlation. In experiments, we use a total of 698 test images extracted from the public ICDAR 2003 robust OCR dataset containing images of single characters in natural scenes. In advance, we classify those images into seven groups according to the degree of image degradations and/or background complexity. On the other hand, we prepare a single-font set of 62 alphanumerics for templates. Experimental results show an average recognition rate of 70.3%, ranging from 95.5% for clear images to 24.3% for little-contrast images."

In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

Scene images usually have non-uniform illumination, complex background, and existence of text-like objects. The common assumption of a homogeneous text region on a nearly uniform background cannot be maintained in real applications. We proposed a text extraction method that utilizes user's hint on the location of the text within the image. A resizable square rim in the viewfinder of the mobile camera, referred to here as a 'focus', is the interface used to help the user indicate the target text. With the hint from the focus, the color of the target text is easily estimated by clustering colors only within the focused section. Image binarization with the estimated color is performed to extract connected components. After obtaining the text region within the focused section, the text region is expanded iteratively by searching neighboring regions with the updated text color. Such an iterative method would prevent the problem of one text region being separated into more than one component due to non-uniform illumination and reflection. A text verification process is conducted on the extracted components to determine the true text region. It is demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high accuracy of text extraction for moderately difficult examples from the ICDAR 2003 database."

An adaptive color modeling and searching algorithm is then utilized near the initial text cues, to discriminate text/non-text regions. EM optimization algorithm is used for color modeling, under the constraint of text layout relations for a specific language. The proposed algorithm combines the advantages of several previous approaches for text detection, and utilizes a focus-of-attention approach for text finding. The whole algorithm is applied in a prototype system that can automatically detect and recognize sign input from a video camera, and translate the signs into English text or voice streams. We present evaluation results of our algorithm on this system."

A classifier (e.g. neural network or adaboost trained classifier) within the detector selects a relevant subset of extremal regions, i.e. regions that are connected components of a thresholded image. Properties of extremal regions render the detector very robust to illumination change. Robustness to viewpoint change is achieved by using invariant descriptors and/or by modeling shape variations by the classifier. \n \nThe approach is brought to bear on three problems: text detection, face segmentation and leopard skin detection. High detection rates were obtained for unconstrained (i.e. brightness, affine and font invariant) text detection (92%) with a reasonable false positive rate. \n \nThe time-complexity of the detection is approximately linear in the number of pixels and a non-optimized implementation runs at about 1 frame per second for a 640\u00d7 480 image on a high-end PC."

                "text": "Scene text recognition (STR) is the recognition of text anywhere in the environment, such as signs and storefronts. Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition.

Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing into the loopof the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

The standard algorithm makes use of a union-find data structure and takes quasi-linear time in the number of pixels. The new algorithm provides exactly identical results in true worst-case linear time. Moreover, the new algorithm uses significantly less memory and has better cache-locality, resulting in faster execution. Our CPU implementation performs twice as fast as a state-of-the-art FPGA implementation based on the standard algorithm. \n \nThe new algorithm is based on a different computational ordering of the pixels, which is suggested by another immersion analogy than the one corresponding to the standard connected-component algorithm. With the new computational ordering, the pixels considered or visited at any point during computation consist of a single connected component of pixels in the image, resembling a flood-fill that adapts to the grey-level landscape. The computation only needs a priority queue of candidate pixels (the boundary of the single connected component), a single bit image masking visited pixels, and information for as many components as there are grey-levels in the image. This is substantially more compact in practice than the standard algorithm, where a large number of connected components must be considered in parallel. The new algorithm can also generate the component tree of the image in true linear time. The result shows that MSER detection is not tied to the union-find data structure, which may open more possibilities for parallelization."

The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification)."

We illustrate the usefulness of kernel algorithms by discussing applications such as optical character recognition and DNA analysis."

A new reliability metric is proposed and a practical solution based on the combination of multiple commercial OCR engines is introduced. Experimental results show that the combination system is both much more accurate and more reliable when compared with individual engines, thus it can fully satisfy the need of digital content re-mastering applications."
