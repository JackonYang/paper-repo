The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

We propose three different classifications for published tables, and develop methods to detect these tables and correctly identify their respective rows and columns. We also explain how to recognize spanning rows and columns, and multi-line rows. Experimental results show that our algorithm is effective in converting a wide variety of tabular presentations into HTML for information extraction purposes."

Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our findings."

We put forward a flexible representation scheme for complex tables, based on a clear distinction between the physical layout of a table and its logical structure. Relying on this scheme, we develop a new method for the detection and the extraction of tables by an analysis of the graphic lines. To deal with tables that lack all or most of the graphic marks, one must focus on the regularities of the text elements alone. We propose such a method, based on a multi-level analysis of the layout of text components on a page. A general graph representation of the relative positions of blocks of text is exploited."

We investigate the state of the art in table detection, extraction and annotation in PDF documents. Because of varying table structural anatomy, the state of the art in table-related research enumerates a number of approaches that are critically and analytically investigated for identifying their strengths and limitations as well as for making recommendations for further improvement. An evaluation framework is contributed that compares different information extraction tools that may be used in table detection, extraction and annotation. We found very limited attention towards these aspects in books, especially books in PDF format. There is no searching solution that can find books having tables that are semantically related to a table in a given book."

However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

The model can be used to aid the design of table processing systems (We provide an example of such a system), can be considered as a reference framework for evaluating the performance of table processing systems, and can assist in clarifying terminological differences in the table processing literature."

Such \u201cdocuments born digital\u201d range from plain text documents such as emails to more sophisticated forms such as PDF documents and Web documents. On the one hand, the existence of the digital encoding of documents eliminates the need for scanning, image processing, and character recognition in most situations (a notable exception being the prevalent use of text embedded in images for Web documents, as elaborated upon in section \u201cAnalysis of Text in Web Images\u201d). On the other hand, many higher-level processing tasks remain due to the fact that the design purpose of almost existing digital document encoding systems (i.e., HTML, PDF) is for display or printing for human consumption, not for machine-level information exchange and extraction. As such, significant amount of processing is still required for automatic information extraction, indexing, and content repurposing from such documents, and many challenges exist in this process. This chapter describes in detail the key technologies for processing documents born digital, with a focus on PDF and Web document processing."
