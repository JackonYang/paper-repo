Ground truth is efficiently created using a new semi-automated tool and stored in a new comprehensive XML representation, the PAGE format.

We show that current evaluation scores are insufficient for diagnosing specific errors in page segmentation and fail to identify some classes of serious segmentation errors altogether. This paper introduces a vectorial score that is sensitive to, and identifies, the most important classes of segmentation errors (over, under, and mis-segmentation) and what page components (lines, blocks, etc.) are affected. Unlike previous schemes, our evaluation method has a canonical representation of ground-truth data and guarantees pixel-accurate evaluation results for arbitrary region shapes. We present the results of evaluating widely used segmentation algorithms (x-y cut, smearing, whitespace analysis, constrained text-line finding, docstrum, and Voronoi) on the UW-III database and demonstrate that the new evaluation scheme permits the identification of several specific flaws in individual segmentation methods."

For ground truth production of large corpora, however, there is still a gap in terms of productivity. Ground truth is not only crucial for training and evaluation at the development stage of tools but also for quality assurance in the scope of production workflows for digital libraries. This paper describes Aletheia, an advanced system for accurate and yet cost-effective ground truthing of large amounts of documents. It aids the user with a number of automated and semi-automated tools which were partly developed and improved based on feedback from major libraries across Europe and from their digitisation service providers which are using the tool in a production environment. Novel features are, among others, the support of top-down ground truthing with sophisticated split and shrink tools as well as bottom-up ground truthing supporting the aggregation of lower-level elements to more complex structures. Special features have been developed to support working with the complexities of historical documents. The integrated rules and guidelines validator, in combination with powerful correction tools, enable efficient production of highly accurate ground truth."

                "text": "Document layout analysis or page segmentation is the task of decomposing document images into many different regions such as texts, images, separators, and tables. It is still a challenging problem due to the variety of document layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid method, which includes three main stages to deal with this problem. In the first stage, the text and non-text elements are classified by using minimum homogeneity algorithm. This method is the combination of connected component analysis and multilevel homogeneity structure. Then, in the second stage, a new homogeneity structure is combined with an adaptive mathematical morphology in the text document to get a set of text regions. Besides, on the non-text document, further classification of non-text elements is applied to get separator regions, table regions, image regions, etc. The final stage, in refinement region and noise detection process, all regions both in the text document and non-text document are refined to eliminate noises and get the geometric layout of each region. The proposed method has been tested with the dataset of ICDAR2009 page segmentation competition and many other databases with different languages. The results of these tests showed that our proposed method achieves a higher accuracy compared to other methods. This proves the effectiveness and superiority of our method."

A number of approaches have been proposed but the quality of separation result is still limited due to the complex of the document layout. In this paper, we present an efficient method for the classification of text and non-text components in document image. It is the combination of whitespace analysis with multi-layer homogeneous regions which called recursive filter. Firstly, the input binary document is analyzed by connected components analysis and whitespace extraction. Secondly, a heuristic filter is applied to identify non-text components. After that, using statistical method, we implement the recursive filter on multi-layer homogeneous regions to identify all text and non-text elements of the binary image. Finally, all regions will be reshaped and remove noise to get the text document and non-text document. Experimental results on the ICDAR2009 page segmentation competition dataset and other datasets prove the effectiveness and superiority of proposed method."

The dataset contains over 600,000 document images that originate from major European libraries and are representative of both their respective holdings and digitisation plans for the near to medium term. It is truly unique with regard to the very substantial amount of high-quality ground truth which is available for approximately 45,000 pages, capturing detailed layout, reading order and text content. The dataset is publicly available through the IMPACT Centre of Competence (www.digitisation.eu)."

The proposed method can be applied to spatially varying states as well as invariant ones, so that general cases including images of complex layout, cameracaptured images, and handwritten ones can also be handled. Specifically, we find CCs (Connected Components) in a document image and assign a state to each of them. Then the states of CCs are estimated using an energy minimization framework, where the cost function is designed based on frequency domain analysis and minimized via graph-cuts. Using the estimated states, we also develop a new algorithm that performs text block identification and text line extraction. Roughly speaking, we can segment an image into text blocks by cutting the distant connections among the CCs (compared to the estimated interline spacing), and we can group the CCs into text lines using a bottom-up grouping along the estimated text line orientation. Experimental results on a variety of document images show that our method is efficient and provides promising results in several document image processing tasks."

However, most of these methods have focused on the scene text detection problem and relatively little work has been performed on camera-captured document images. In this paper, we present a text-line detection algorithm for camera-captured document images, which is an essential step toward document understanding. In particular, our method is developed by incorporating state estimation (an extension of scale selection) into a connected component (CC)-based framework. To be precise, we extract CCs with the maximally stable extremal region algorithm and estimate the scales and orientations of CCs from their projection profiles. Since this state estimation facilitates a merging process (bottom-up clustering) and provides a stopping criterion, our method is able to handle arbitrarily oriented text-lines and works robustly for a range of scales. Finally, a text-line/non-text-line classifier is trained and non-text candidates (e.g., background clutters) are filtered out with the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods on a standard dataset and works well for a new challenging dataset."

The algorithms are considerably easier to implement than prior methods, they return globally optimal solutions, and they require no heuristics. The paper also introduces an evaluation function that reliably identifies maximal empty rectangles corresponding to column boundaries. Combining this evaluation function with the two geometric algorithms results in an easy-to-implement layout analysis system. Reliability of the system is demonstrated on documents from the UW3 database."
