If one couples this fact with the obvious need for correct classification of disease entities, then the problem of choosing the \"best\" texture algorithm becomes one of concern. The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical comparison of the \"innate\" abilities of four texture analysis algorithms to do automated texture discrimination.

A GCM is determined by a spatial constraint predicate F and a set of local features P = {(Xi, Yi, di), i = 1,..., m} where (Xi, Yi) is the location of the ith feature, and di is a description of the ith feature. The GCM of P under F, GF, is defined by GF(i, j) = number of pairs, pk, pl such that F(pk, pl) is true and di and dj are the descriptions of pk and pl, respectively.

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

In this paper a class of pictures of medical importance, namely, chest X-ray pictures, is used to test the proposed preprocessing and feature-extraction technique. The technique presented in this paper is applied only to chest X-ray images; however, the same technique could also be applied to a fairly broad class of picture patterns with only some minor modifications. The proposed preprocessing technique, which utilizes the local and global information of the picture patterns, is to extract the lung boundary. The lung field is then enclosed by a polygon which is the piecewise linear approximation of the lung boundary. The set of texture features, which are the average of some local property measures, is has then extracted in this approximated lung area. The proposed technique been tested on two sets of X-ray picture classes?one with abnormalities caused by a known disease and the others with abnormalities caused by some unkown effects in the lung region. The classification results presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed pictorial pattern recognition system in effectively screening out the abnormal pictures without human intervention."

The scenes which consisted of 6 samples from each of the nine categories scrub, orchard, heavily wooded, urban, suburban, lake, swamp, marsh, and railroad yard was analyzed manually and automatically. For the automatic analysis, a set of features measuring the spatial dependence of the grey tones of neighboring resolution cells was defined. On the basis of these features and a simple decision rule which assumed that the features were independent and uniformly distributed on identification accuracy of 70% was achieved by training of 53 samples and assigning an identification to the 54th sample and repeating the experiment 54 times. This identification accuracy must be compared with the average 81% correct identification which five photointerpreters achieved with the same scenes, although the 81% correct identification is the accuracy achieved when they used the 9\" \u00d7 9\" photograph to interpret from. Note that the photograph is data of considerably higher resolution having much more context information on it than the small digitized 1/8\" \u00d7 1/8\" area the automatic analysis had available."

The procedure is based on a set of descriptors which give a statistical description of porous media. These features are evaluated from digitized photomicrographs of reservoir rocks and they characterize the rock grain structure in term of (1) the linear dependency of grey tones in the photomicrograph image, (2) the degree of \"homogeneity\" of the image and (3) the angular variations of the image grey tone dependencies. On the basis of these textural features, a simple identification rule using piecewise linear discriminant functions is developed for categorizing the photomicrograph images. The procedure was applied to a set of 243 distinct images comprising 6 distinct rock categories. The coefficients of the discriminant functions were obtained using 143 training samples. The remaining (100) samples were then processed, each sample being assigned to one of 6 possible sandstone categories. Eighty-nine per cent of the test samples were correctly identified."

Recognition of terrain types is based on spatial signatures that become evident by processing small portions of an image through selected algorithms. An investigation of spatial signatures that are applicable to ERTS-1 MSS images is described. Artifacts in the spatial signatures seem to be related to the multispectral scanner. A method for suppressing such artifacts is presented. Finally, results of terrain type recognition for one ERTS-1 image are presented."

For a discrete set of points in the region we may observe into which subregion they each fall. The problem is to obtain an estimated reconstruction of the partition based on the observations. Section 1 outlines a probabilistic approach to the problem and defines criteria of goodness for an estimated reconstruction. Section 2 evaluates the performance of nearest-point rules. Section 3 examines the effect of sample-size and compares several arrangements of the data points. Section 4 proposes a modification of nearest-point procedures having a certain optimality property. Section 5 is more or less independent of the earlier sections; it explores several probabilistic partitioning models. (Author)"

Coherent optical systems have the added property that one may easily obtain many successive two-dimensional Fourier transforms of any given light amplitude distribution, or, by use of astigmatic optics, one-dimensional transforms can be obtained. Therefore, most linear operations of an integral transform nature are easily implemented. The optical implementation of integral transforms which are of importance to communication theory is discussed; the general problems of optical filter synthesis and multichannel computation and data processing are introduced, followed by a discussion of potential applications. Astigmatic systems, which permit multichannel operation in lieu of two-dimensional processing, are treated as a special case of general two-dimensional processors. Complex input functions are discussed with relation to their role in coherent optical systems."

Hopkins for the image forming properties of an optical system in terms of a coherence factor over the object plane, the two extreme cases of complete coherence and incoherence are considered. The incoherent case is treated briefly as a low-pass spatial frequency filter. In the case of coherent illumination, it is shown that the optical analog of such well-known electrical concepts as equalization [17], edge-sharpening, and the detection of periodic and isolated signals in the presence of noise can be carried out with relative ease. A detailed theoretical treatment of the problem together with illustrations emphasizes the analogy between optical and electrical filtering."

The author sees greater promise in approaches using the distance from elements of the figure to the perimeter, Bunge's inscribed polygons, and the distance from elements of the figure to the center (Thunen, Blair and Biss). Further work on shape indices is urged with a view to deriving measures that would reflect not only compactness, but also the degree of dissection and contour indentation.

It also becomes easy to show that the natural \"edge-following\" algorithm, in which one \"keeps one's hand on the wall,\" follows completely around the edge of any simply-connected object; this result in turn can be used to show that a well-known \"border-following\" algorithm (in which one follows the border elements of the object rather than the \"cracks\" between the object and its comple- ment) always works.

This paper describes a quickly implementable table look-up rule based on Ashby\u2019s representation of sets in his constraint analysis. A decision region for category c in the N-dimensional measurement space is considered to be the intersection of the inverse projections of the decision regions determined for category c by Bayes rules in smaller dimensional projection spaces. Error bounds for this composite decision rule are derived: any entry in the confusion matrix for the composite decision rule is bounded above by the minimum of that entry taken over all the confusion matrices of the Bayes decision rules in the smaller dimensional projection spaces. On simulated Gaussian Data, probability of error with the table look-up rule is comparable to the optimum Bayes rule."
