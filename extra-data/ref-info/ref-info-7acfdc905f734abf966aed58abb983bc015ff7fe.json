Here we describe a procedure for obtaining paraphrases from news articles. Articles derived from different newspapers can contain paraphrases if they report the same event on the same day. We exploit this feature by using Named Entity recognition. Our approach is based on the assumption that Named Entities are preserved across paraphrases. We applied our method to articles of two domains and obtained notable examples. Although this is our initial attempt at automatically extracting paraphrases from a corpus, the results are promising."

We consider the five alignment models presented in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques, and refinements. These statistical models are compared with two heuristic models based on the Dice coefficient. We present different methods for combining word alignments to perform a symmetrization of directed statistical alignment models. As evaluation criterion, we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We evaluate the models on the German-English Verbmobil task and the French-English Hansards task. We perform a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes. An important result is that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models. In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The idea of the model is to make the alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word orderings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several bilingual corpora."

As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment.
