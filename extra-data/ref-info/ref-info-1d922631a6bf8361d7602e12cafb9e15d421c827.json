Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."

The algorithm checks the context surrounding the target noun against that of previously observed instances and chooses the sense for which the most evidence is found, where evidence consists of a set of orthographic, syntactic, and lexical features. Because the sense distinctions made are coarse, the disambiguation can be accomplished without the expense of knowledge bases or inference mechanisms. An implementation of the algorithm is described which, starting with a small set of hand-labeled instances, improves its results automatically via unsupervised training. The approach is compared to other attempts at homograph disambiguation using both machine readable dictionaries and unrestricted text and the use of training instances is determined to be a crucial di erence."

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

The automatic construction of VLNNs enables real-size experiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in turn provides insight into their behaviour and design and can lead to possible improvements."

As a background we shall present in the following sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand, no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language. Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects. (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat unexpected shift from \"lemmatization\" to \"disambiguation\" will be justified in the sections to come.) Based on"

They can involve two, three or more words, these words can be of different syntactic categories and they can be involved in more or less rigid ways. This leads to two main difficulties: collocational knowledge has to be acquired and it must be represented flexibly so that it can be used for language generation. We address both problems in this paper, focusing on the acquisition problem. We describe a program, Xtract, that automatically acquires a range of collocations from large textual corpora and we describe how they can be represented in a flexible lexicon using a unification based formalism."

The objective is to develop facilities for working with large document collections that provide more refined access to the information contained in these \"source\" materials than is possible through current information retrieval procedures. The tools being used for this purpose are machine-readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and related \"resources\" that provide geographical, biographical, and other kinds of specialized knowledge. A major feature of the research program is the exploitation of the reciprocal relationships between sources and resources. These interactions between texts and tools are intended to support experts who organize and use information in a workstation environment. Two systems under development will be described to illustrate the approach: one providing capabilities for full-text subject assessment; the other for concept elaboration while reading text. Progress in the research depends critically on developments in artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and information science to provide a scientific base, and on software engineering, database management, and distributed systems to provide the technology."
