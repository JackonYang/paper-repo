Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."

The algorithm checks the context surrounding the target noun against that of previously observed instances and chooses the sense for which the most evidence is found, where evidence consists of a set of orthographic, syntactic, and lexical features. Because the sense distinctions made are coarse, the disambiguation can be accomplished without the expense of knowledge bases or inference mechanisms. An implementation of the algorithm is described which, starting with a small set of hand-labeled instances, improves its results automatically via unsupervised training. The approach is compared to other attempts at homograph disambiguation using both machine readable dictionaries and unrestricted text and the use of training instances is determined to be a crucial di erence."

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature."

In this paper, a different approach to formulating a probabilistic model is presented along with a case study of the performance of models produced in this manner for the disambiguation of the noun interest. We describe a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation, without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model. Using this approach, the joint distribution of all variables is described by only the most systematic variable interactions, thereby limiting the number of parameters to be estimated, supporting computational efficiency, and providing an understanding of the data."

The techniques were based on Bayesian decision theory, neural, networks, and content vectors as used in information retrieval. To understand these methods better, we posed a very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts. To see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three- and six-sense tasks are compared.The results demonstrate that each of the techniques is able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy greater than 70%. Furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another. Comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy."

This approach exploits the differences between mappings of words to senses in different languages. The paper concentrates on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable. The presented algorithm identifies syntactic relations between words, using a source language parser, and maps the alternative interpretations of these relations to the target language, using a bilingual lexicon. The preferred senses are then selected according to statistics on lexical relations in the target language. The selection is based on a statistical model and on a constraint propagation algorithm, which simultaneously handles all ambiguities in the sentence. The method was evaluated using three sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very useful for disambiguation. The paper includes a detailed comparative analysis of statistical sense disambiguation methods."

By identifying and utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies. Although directly applicable to a wide class of ambiguities, the algorithm is described and evaluated in a realistic case study, the problem of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French text. Current accuracy exceeds 99% on the full task, and typically is over 90% for even the most difficult ambiguities."

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

Three classical tasks are discriminating texts by their authors (author identification), discriminating documents by their relevance to some query (information retrieval), and discriminating multi-meaning words by their meanings (sense discrimination). Many other discrimination tasks arise regularly, such as determining whether a particular proper noun represents a person or a place, or whether a given work from some teletype text would be capitalized if both cases had been used.We [9] introduced a method designed for the sense discrimination problems mentioned.We also discuss areas for research based on observed shortcomings of the method. In particular, an example in the author identification task shows the need for a robust version of the method. Also, the method makes an assumption of independence which is demonstrably false, yet there has been no careful study of the results of this assumption."

                "text": "A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Eric Brill Supervisor: Mitchell Marcus One goal of computational linguistics is to discover a method for assigning a rich structural annotation to sentences that are presented as simple linear strings of words; meaning can be much more readily extracted from a structurally annotated sentence than from a sentence with no structural information. Also, structure allows for a more in-depth check of the well-formedness of a sentence. There are two phases to assigning these structural annotations: rst, a knowledge base is created and second, an algorithm is used to generate a structural annotation for a sentence based upon the facts provided in the knowledge base. Until recently, most knowledge bases were created manually by language experts. These knowledge bases are expensive to create and have not been used e ectively in structurally parsing sentences from other than highly restricted domains. The goal of this dissertation is to make signi cant progress toward designing automata that are able to learn some structural aspects of human language with little human guidance. In particular, we describe a learning algorithm that takes a small structurally annotated corpus of text and a larger unannotated corpus as input, and automatically learns how to assign accurate structural descriptions to sentences not in the training corpus. The main tool we use to automatically discover structural information about language from corpora is transformation-based error-driven learning. The distribution of errors produced by an imperfect annotator is examined to learn an ordered list of transformations that can be applied to provide an accurate structural annotation. We demonstrate the application of this learning algorithm iv to part of speech tagging and parsing. Successfully applying this technique to create systems that learn could lead to robust, trainable and accurate natural language processing systems. v"

In general, once the process has been applied to the corpus, the system contains both some residual representation of the instances and some explicit augmentation of that representation with information that was implicit in the corpus. For example, part of the residual representation of He feels happy on Fridays might be the (word sense) pair (happy feel-as-emotion), and part of the augmentation might be the probability of happy co-occurring with the sense of feel as an emotion. We show that for the simple residual representation of (word sense) pairs, the existence of such a representation in and of itself captures much of the regularity inherent in the data. We also demonstrate that augmenting the residual representation with the actual number of times each pair occurs in the training corpus provides most of the remainder of the power of probabalistic approaches. Finally, we show how viewing this residual representation as a form of episodic memory can enable symbolic, knowledge-rich systems to take advantage of this source of regularity in performing sense resolution."

This makes the vector representations (which are dense) too cumbersome to use directly. Therefore, dimensionality reduction by means of a singular value decomposition is employed.

Before the first call for papers for ACL 95 was issued, the executive committee had engaged in a lengthy and very constructive discussion of the appropriate format for a session at which student members of ACL could present work in progress. This discussion also involved program and student program chairs from this as well as previous conferences. It was decided that a poster session would be the best forum for presenting high-quality research not yet at the state to qualify for the main sessions. We feel that the excellent selection of papers made by the student program committee justifies this decision and we hope that the students will continue to participate actively in our annual meetings."
