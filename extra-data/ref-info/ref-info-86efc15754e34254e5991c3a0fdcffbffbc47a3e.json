Stochastic algorithms -- in particular, particle filters and the Condensation algorithm -- have dramatically enhanced the state of the art for such visual tracking problems in recent years. This book presents a unified framework for visual tracking using particle filters, including the new technique of partitioned sampling which can alleviate the \"curse of dimensionality\" suffered by standard particle filters. The book also introduces the notion of contour likelihood: a collection of models for assessing object shape, colour and motion, which are derived from the statistical properties of image features. Because of their statistical nature, contour likelihoods are ideal for use in stochastic algorithms. A unifying theme of the book is the use of statistics and probability, which enable the final output of the algorithms presented to be interpreted as the computer's \"belief\" about the state of the world. The book will be of use and interest to students, researchers and practitioners in computer vision, and assumes only an elementary knowledge of probability theory."

Possible configurations are evaluated using the contour discriminant, a likelihood ratio which is derived from a probabilistic model of the feature detection process. We treat each step in this process probabilistically, including the occurrence of clutter features, and derive the observation densities for both correct \"target\" configurations and incorrect \"clutter\" configurations. The contour discriminant distinguishes target objects from the background even in heavy clutter, making only the most general assumptions about the form that clutter might take. The method generates samples stochastically to avoid the cost of processing an entire image, and promises to be particularly suited to the task of initialising contour trackers based on sampling methods."

Real-time high-level systems perform poorly in clutter and initialisation for most high-level systems is either performed manually or by a separate module. This paper presents a new technique to combine low- and high-level information in a consistent probabilistic framework, using the statistical technique of importance sampling combined with the Condensation algorithm. The general framework, which we term Icondensation, is described, and a hand tracker is demonstrated which combines colour blob-tracking with a contour model. The resulting tracker is robust to rapid motion, heavy clutter and hand-coloured distractors, and re-initialises automatically. The system runs comfortably in real time on an entry-level desktop workstation."

In some situations this assumption is not valid: the track able shape of an object may change discontinuously, for example if it is the 2D silhouette of a 3D object. In this paper we propose a novel method for modelling temporal shape discontinuities explicitly. Allowable shapes are represented as a union of (learned) bounded regions within a shape space. Discontinuous shape changes are described in terms of transitions between these regions. Transition probabilities are learned from training sequences and stored in a Markov model. In this way we can create 'wormholes' in shape space. Tracking with such models is via an adaptation, of the CONDENSATION algorithm."

Previous systems have been available to do this for specially illuminated objects or for naturally illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following only centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system described here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines curve representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility can be used to turn parts of the body\u2014for instance, hands and lips\u2014into input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a 3D mouse with non-rigid gestures signalling a button press or the \u201clifting\u201d of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked independently and used as inputs, for example to animate a computer-generated face."

The described behavior system operates in conjunction with a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that provides a mathematically concise formulation for incorporating a wide variety of physical constraints and probabilistic influences. The framework takes the form of a non-linear recursive filter that enables pixel-level, probabilistic processes to take advantage of the contextual knowledge encoded in the higher-level models. Results are shown that demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative gains in tracking performance."

In the interface, gesture replaces the mouse for many actions including selecting, moving and resizing windows. A camera below the screen observes the user. The hand is segmented from the background using color. Features of the hand's motion are extracted from the sequence of segmented images, and when needed the hand's pose is classified using a neural net. This information is parsed by a task specific grammar. The system runs in real time on standard PC hardware. It has demonstrated its abilities with various users in several different office environments. Having experimented with a functioning gestural interface, the authors discuss the practicality and best applications of this technology."

An algebraic structure, analogous to the trilinear tensor for three perspective cameras, is defined for configurations of three centered affine cameras. This centered affine trifocal tensor contains 12 non-zero coefficients and involves linear relations between point correspondences and trilinear relations between line correspondences. It is shown how the affine trifocal tensor relates to the perspective trilinear tensor, and how three-dimensional motion can be computed from this tensor in a straightforward manner. A factorization approach is also developed to handle point features and line features simultaneously in image sequences. This theory is applied to a specific problem in human-computer interaction of capturing three-dimensional rotations from gestures of a human hand. Besides the obvious application, this test problem illustrates the usefulness of the affine trifocal tensor in a situation where sufficient information is not available to compute the perspective trilinear tensor, while the geometry requires point correspondences as well as line correspondences over at least three views."

The first of the system's three channels does a shape analysis on gray-level images to determine the location of individual facial features as well as the outlines of heads. In the second channel the color space is analyzed with a clustering algorithm to find areas of skin colors. The color space is first calibrated, using the results from the other channels. In the third channel motion information is extracted from frame differences. Head outlines are determined by analyzing the shapes of areas with large motion vectors. All three channels produce lists of shapes, each marking an area of the image where a facial feature or a part of the outline of a head may be present. Combinations of such shapes are evaluated with n-gram searches to produce a list of likely head positions and the locations of facial features. We tested the system for tracking faces of people sitting in front of terminals and video phones and used it to track people entering through a doorway."

Under this framework, several currently available techniques are studied and generalized to accommodate more complex features. All of these methods are partial combinations of three ingredients: importance sampling and resampling, rejection sampling, and Markov chain iterations. We provide guidelines on how they should be used and under what circumstance each method is most suitable. Through the analysis of differences and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm by combining desirable features. In addition, we propose a general use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performance. Examples from econometrics and engineering are presented to demonstrate the importance of Rao\u2013Blackwellization and to compare different Monte Carlo procedures."

Conditions under which the numerical approximation converges almost surely to the true value with the number of Monte Carlo replications, and its numerical accuracy may be assessed reliably, are given. Importance sampling densities are derived from multivariate normal or student approximations to the posterior density. These densities are modified by automatic rescaling along each axis. The concept of relative numerical efficiency is introduced to evaluate the adequacy of a chosen importance sampling density. Applications in two illustrative models are presented.

                "text": "One fifth (4 of 20) of the research articles published in the Journal of Educational Statistics in 1988 include simulation studies that justify or illustrate the authors' conclusions. A similar fraction (6 of 33) of the articles in the 1988 volume of Psychometrika include simulations; comparable proportions could be expected in other journals at the boundary of theoretical statistics and social/psychological applications. Due in part to the complexity of the problems tackled today and in part to the availability of cheap, powerful computing\u2014by no means independent influences\u2014simulation and Monte Carlo methods have become both necessary and practical tools for statisticians and applied workers in quantitative areas of education and psychology. Simulation has become popular\u2014not only in the quantitative social sciences, but in all of the mathematical sciences from physics to operations research to number theory\u2014because it is almost always easy to do. This ease of use makes the simulation experimenter vulnerable to two common pitfalls. Selection of the basic source of \"random numbers\" is often passive: Whatever is available in the computer's standard subroutine library is used. However, the fact that a pseudo-random number generator appears in a popular software package or operating system is hardly reason to trust it, as is shown by the infamous RANDU generator, once popular on IBM mainframes and PDP mini-computers, and by the generators burned into RAM on today's PCs. Simulation design and reporting also deserve special care. Some attempt must be made to assess the accuracy of the simulation estimates: One should accurately estimate and report SE (6) as well as 6. In addition, enough detail should be reported that the interested reader can replicate the study and check the results, just as with other experiments. Yet these considerations are also easy to overlook. Brian D. Ripley's Stochastic Simulation is a short, yet ambitious, survey of modern simulation techniques. Three themes run throughout the book. First, one shoud not take basic simulation subroutines for granted, especially on minior microcomputers where they tend to be poor implementations, implementations of poor algorithms, or both. Second, design of experiments, or variance reduction as it is known in this field, deserves greater consideration. Third, modern methods make it possible to simulate and analyze processes that are dependent over time, and using such processes opens the door to new simulation techniques, such as simulated annealing in optimization. Ripley intends this book to be a \"comprehensive guide,\" and it is indeed most accurately described as a researcher's handbook with examples and"
