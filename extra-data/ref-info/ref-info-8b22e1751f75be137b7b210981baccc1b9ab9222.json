This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. The parametrization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface. The intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory. The patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element, permitting the simulation of mirror reflections. The amount of light coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture mapping. Several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included."

The projection of a flat source image onto a curved surface may involve sampling difficulties, however, which are compounded as the view of the surface changes. As the projected scale of the surface increases, interpolation between the original samples of the source image is necessary; as the scale is reduced, approximation of multiple samples in the source is required. Thus a constantly changing sampling window of view-dependent shape must traverse the source image. To reduce the computation implied by these requirements, a set of prefiltered source images may be created. This approach can be applied to particular advantage in animation, where a large number of frames using the same source image must be generated. This paper advances a \u201cpyramidal parametric\u201d prefiltering and sampling geometry which minimizes aliasing effects and assures continuity within and between target images. Although the mapping of texture onto surfaces is an excellent example of the process and provided the original motivation for its development, pyramidal parametric data structures admit of wider application. The aliasing of not only surface texture, but also highlights and even the surface representations themselves, may be minimized by pyramidal parametric means."

Usually the procedure is to perform some inverse mapping from the area of the pixel onto the surface texture. It is difficult to do this correctly. There is an alternate approach where the texture surface is transformed as a 2-D image until it conforms to a projection of a polygon placed arbitrarily in 3-space. The great advantage of this approach is that the 2-D transformation can be decomposed into two simple transforms, one in horizontal and the other in vertical scanline order. horizontal scanline order, Sophisticated light calculation is also time consuming and difficult to calculate correctly on projected polygons. Instead of calculating the lighting based on the position of the polygon, lights, and eye, the lights and eye can be transformed to a corresponding position for a unit square which we can consider to be a canonical polygon. After this canonical polygon is correctly textured and shaded it can be easily conformed to the projection of the 3-D surface."

Three-dimensional curved patches are used, as contrasted with conventional methods using polygons. The method subdivides a patch into successively smaller subpatches until a subpatch is as small as a raster- element, at which time it can be displayed. In general this method could be very time consuming because of the great number of subdivisions that must take place; however, there is at least one very useful class of patches - the bicubic patch - that can be subdivided very quickly. Pitures produced with the method accurately portray the shading and silhouette of curved surfaces. In addition, photographs can be 'mapped' onto patches thus providing a means for putting texture on computer-generated pictures."

The smooth shading technique described here has been used to produce a large variety of pictures of which several airplanes, a car, a human face and some mathematical surfaces are included to illustrate the effect of the method.

We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as \u201cfractional Brownian motion,\u201d has been developed by Mandelbrot.\nThe value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively."
