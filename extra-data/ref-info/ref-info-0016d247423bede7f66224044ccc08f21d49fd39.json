The CTPN detects a text line in a sequence of fine-scale text proposals directly in convolutional feature maps. We develop a vertical anchor mechanism that jointly predicts location and text/non-text score of each fixed-width proposal, considerably improving localization accuracy. The sequential proposals are naturally connected by a recurrent neural network, which is seamlessly incorporated into the convolutional network, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model. This allows the CTPN to explore rich context information of image, making it powerful to detect extremely ambiguous text. The CTPN works reliably on multi-scale and multi-language text without further post-processing, departing from previous bottom-up methods requiring multi-step post filtering. It achieves 0.88 and 0.61 F-measure on the ICDAR 2013 and 2015 benchmarks, surpassing recent results [8, 35] by a large margin. The CTPN is computationally efficient with 0.14 s/image, by using the very deep VGG16 model [27]. Online demo is available: http://textdet.com/."

Both local and global cues are taken into account for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine procedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model is trained to predict the salient map of text regions in a holistic manner. Then, text line hypotheses are estimated by combining the salient map and character components. Finally, another FCN classifier is used to predict the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The framework is general for handling text in multiple orientations, languages and fonts. The proposed method consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three text detection benchmarks: MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015 and ICDAR2013."

This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

However, vast majority of the existing methods detect text within local regions, typically through extracting character, word or line level candidates followed by candidate aggregation and false positive elimination, which potentially exclude the effect of wide-scope and long-range contextual cues in the scene. To take full advantage of the rich information available in the whole natural image, we propose to localize text in a holistic manner, by casting scene text detection as a semantic segmentation problem. The proposed algorithm directly runs on full images and produces global, pixel-wise prediction maps, in which detections are subsequently formed. To better make use of the properties of text, three types of information regarding text region, individual characters and their relationship are estimated, with a single Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. With such predictions of text properties, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously handle horizontal, multi-oriented and curved text in real-world natural images. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we report the first baseline result on the recently-released, large-scale dataset COCO-Text."

This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learning with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures."

In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust method for detecting texts in natural scene images. A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and clustering threshold are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with a character classifier; text candidates with high non-text probabilities are eliminated and texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition database; the f-measure is over 76%, much better than the state-of-the-art performance of 71%. Experiments on multilingual, street view, multi-orientation and even born-digital databases also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU."

Its real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection and segmentation problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions. The ER detector is robust against blur, low contrast and illumination, color and texture variation. In the first stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using features calculated by a novel algorithm in constant time and only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification accuracy is improved using computationally more expensive features. A highly efficient clustering algorithm then groups ERs into text lines and an OCR classifier trained on synthetic fonts is exploited to label character regions. The most probable character sequence is selected in the last stage when the context of each character is known. The method was evaluated on three public datasets. On the ICDAR 2013 dataset the method achieves state-of-the-art results in text localization; on the more challenging SVT dataset, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that the proposed pipeline can incorporate additional prior knowledge about the detected text. The proposed method was exploited as the baseline in the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading competition, where it compares favourably to the state-of-the art."

Traditional systems in this area have relied on elaborate models incorporating carefully hand-engineered features or large amounts of prior knowledge. In this paper, we take a different route and combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003."

Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection. Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches. The two classifiers are built upon two novel Text Covariance Descriptors (TCDs) that encode both the heuristic properties and the statistical characteristics of text stokes. Finally, text regions are located by simply thresholding the text-line confident map. Our method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ICDAR 2005 and ICDAR 2011, and the corresponding F-measure values are 0.72 and 0.73, respectively, surpassing previous methods in accuracy by a large margin."

Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios."

Stroke-specific keypoints are efficiently detected and text fragments are subsequently extracted by local thresholding guided by keypoint properties. Classification based on effectively calculated features then eliminates non-text regions. The stroke-specific keypoints produce 2 times less region segmentations and still detect 25% more characters than the commonly exploited MSER detector and the process is 4 times faster. After a novel efficient classification step, the number of regions is reduced to 7 times less than the standard method and is still almost 3 times faster. All stages of the proposed pipeline are scale-and rotation-invariant and support a wide variety of scripts (Latin, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.) and fonts. When the proposed detector is plugged into a scene text localization and recognition pipeline, a state-of-the-art text localization accuracy is maintained whilst the processing time is significantly reduced."

However, this low-level pixel operation inherently limits its capability for handling complex text information efficiently (e. g. connections between text or background components), leading to the difficulty in distinguishing texts from background components. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle this problem by leveraging the high capability of convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to recent methods using a set of low-level heuristic features, the CNN network is capable of learning high-level features to robustly identify text components from text-like outliers (e.g. bikes, windows, or leaves). Our approach takes advantages of both MSERs and sliding-window based methods. The MSERs operator dramatically reduces the number of windows scanned and enhances detection of the low-quality texts. While the sliding-window with CNN is applied to correctly separate the connections of multiple characters in components. The proposed system achieved strong robustness against a number of extreme text variations and serious real-world problems. It was evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 benchmark dataset, and achieved over 78% in F-measure, which is significantly higher than previous methods."

We treat text line detection as a graph partitioning problem, where each vertex is represented by a Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER). First, weak hypothesises are proposed by coarsely grouping MSERs based on their spatial alignment and appearance consistency. Then, higher-order correlation clustering (HOCC) is used to partition the MSERs into text line candidates, using the hypotheses as soft constraints to enforce long range interactions. We further propose a regularization method to solve the Semidefinite Programming problem in the inference. Finally we use a simple texton-based texture classifier to filter out the non-text areas. This framework allows us to naturally handle multiple orientations, languages and fonts. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to the state of the art."

Most existing methods have focused on detecting horizontal or near-horizontal texts. In this paper, we propose a system which detects texts of arbitrary orientations in natural images. Our algorithm is equipped with a two-level classification scheme and two sets of features specially designed for capturing both the intrinsic characteristics of texts. To better evaluate our algorithm and compare it with other competing algorithms, we generate a new dataset, which includes various texts in diverse real-world scenarios; we also propose a protocol for performance evaluation. Experiments on benchmark datasets and the proposed dataset demonstrate that our algorithm compares favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms when handling horizontal texts and achieves significantly enhanced performance on texts of arbitrary orientations in complex natural scenes."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification, we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern data center-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency, mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android."

                "text": "Text detection in natural scene images is an important prerequisite for many content-based image analysis tasks, while most current research efforts only focus on horizontal or near horizontal scene text. In this paper, first we present a unified distance metric learning framework for adaptive hierarchical clustering, which can simultaneously learn similarity weights (to adaptively combine different feature similarities) and the clustering threshold (to automatically determine the number of clusters). Then, we propose an effective multi-orientation scene text detection system, which constructs text candidates by grouping characters based on this adaptive clustering. Our text candidates construction method consists of several sequential coarse-to-fine grouping steps: morphology-based grouping via single-link clustering, orientation-based grouping via divisive hierarchical clustering, and projection-based grouping also via divisive clustering. The effectiveness of our proposed system is evaluated on several public scene text databases, e.g., ICDAR Robust Reading Competition data sets (2011 and 2013), MSRA-TD500 and NEOCR. Specifically, on the multi-orientation text data set MSRA-TD500, the <inline-formula><tex-math>$f$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq1-2388210.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> measure of our system is <inline-formula><tex-math>$71$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq2-2388210.gif\"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> percent, much better than the state-of-the-art performance. We also construct and release a practical challenging multi-orientation scene text data set (USTB-SV1K), which is available at http://prir.ustb.edu.cn/TexStar/MOMV-text-detection/."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

A new Challenge 4 on Incidental Scene Text has been added to the Challenges on Born-Digital Images, Focused Scene Images and Video Text. Challenge 4 is run on a newly acquired dataset of 1,670 images evaluating Text Localisation, Word Recognition and End-to-End pipelines. In addition, the dataset for Challenge 3 on Video Text has been substantially updated with more video sequences and more accurate ground truth data. Finally, tasks assessing End-to-End system performance have been introduced to all Challenges. The competition took place in the first quarter of 2015, and received a total of 44 submissions. Only the tasks newly introduced in 2015 are reported on. The datasets, the ground truth specification and the evaluation protocols are presented together with the results and a brief summary of the participating methods."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

                "text": "We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times 300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork."

We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors. Our motivation is the same as it has always been - detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples. Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient. OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use. But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn."
