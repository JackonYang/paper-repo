To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes."

The proposed model exploits local discriminative models and allows to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data given the labels, commonly used in the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classification problems using the graph min-cut algorithms. The performance of the model was verified on the synthetic as well as the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments."

This approach has been successfully used in industrial machine vision, but it is not capable of dealing with the complexities of recognizing classes of similar objects. This paper undertakes this task by proposing and testing a component-based methodology encompassing three main ingredients: 1) a new way of learning and extracting shape-class components from surface shape information; 2) a new shape representation called a symbolic surface signature that summarizes the geometric relationships among components; and 3) an abstract representation of shape classes formed by a hierarchy of classifiers that learn object-class parts and their spatial relationships from examples."

We evaluate the performance of these descriptors on the task of recognizing vehicles in range scans of scenes using a database of 56 cars. We compare the two novel descriptors to an existing descriptor, the spin image, showing that the shape context based descriptors have a higher recognition rate on noisy scenes and that 3D shape contexts outperform the others on cluttered scenes."

The algorithm works on complex real-world scenes (indoor and outdoor), which consist of an unknown number of objects (or surfaces) of various sizes and types, such as planes, conics, smooth surfaces, and cluttered objects (like trees and bushes). Formulated in the Bayesian framework, the posterior probability is distributed over a solution space with a countable number of subspaces of varying dimensions. The algorithm simulates Markov chains with both reversible jumps and stochastic diffusions to traverse the solution space. The reversible jumps realize the moves between subspaces of different dimensions, such as switching surface models and changing the number of objects. The stochastic Langevin equation realizes diffusions within each subspace. To achieve effective computation, the algorithm precomputes some importance proposal probabilities over multiple scales through Hough transforms, edge detection, and data clustering. The latter are used by the Markov chains for fast mixing. The algorithm is tested on 100 1D simulated data sets for performance analysis on both accuracy and speed. Then, the algorithm is applied to three data sets of range images under the same parameter setting. The results are satisfactory in comparison with manual segmentations."

In contrast to traditional surface-signature based systems that use alignment to match specific objects, we adapted the newly introduced symbolic-signature representation to classify deformable shapes [10]. Our approach constructs an abstract description of shape classes using an ensemble of classifiers that learn object class parts and their corresponding geometrical relationships from a set of numeric and symbolic descriptors. We used our classification engine in a series of large scale discrimination experiments on two well-defined classes that share many common distinctive features. The experimental results suggest that our method outperforms traditional numeric signature-based methodologies. 1"

                "text": "Due to the recent improvements in laser scanning technology, 3D visualization and modeling, there is an increasing need for tools supporting the automatic search for 3D objects in archives. In this paper we describe a new geometric approach to 3D shape comparison and retrieval for arbitrary objects described by 3D polyhedral models that may contain gaps. In contrast with existing approaches, our approach takes the overall relative spatial location into account by representing the 3D shape as a weighted point set. To compare two objects geometrically, we generate for each object a weighted point set, which represents for each non-empty grid cell a salient point. We compare three methods to obtain in each grid cell a salient point and a weight: (1) choose the vertex in the cell with the highest Gaussian curvature, and choose as weight a measure for that curvature, (2) choose the area-weighted mean of the vertices in the cell, and choose as weight a measure denoting the normal variation of the facets in the cell and (3) choose the center of mass of all vertices in the cell, and choose as weight one. Finally, we compute the similarity between two shapes by comparing their weighted point sets using a new shape similarity measure based on weight transportation that is a variation of the Earth Mover's Distance. Unlike the Earth Mover's Distance, the new shape similarity measure satisfies the triangle inequality. This property makes it suitable for use in indexing schemes that depend on the triangle inequality, such as the one we introduce, based on so-called vantage objects. The strength of our approach is proven through experimental results using a database consisting of 133 models such as mugs, cars and boats, and a database consisting of 512 models, mostly air planes, classified into conventional air planes, delta-jets, multi-fuselages, biplanes, helicopters and other models. The results show that the retrieval performance is better than related shape matching methods."

In this paper we focus on MRFs with two-valued clique potentials, which form a generalized Potts model. We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion."

We present a compression scheme for spin images that results in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models.

They are powerful shape descriptors, bridging the gap between low-level and high-level object representations. Surprisingly, skeletons have been used in a relatively small number of applications, and almost every time for very precise and concrete tasks. This work focuses on the problem of object registration using the objects\u2019 medial axis. We first build adequate attributed relational graphs to organize in a structured way informations about object shape and topology contained in the medial axis. Using a graph matching algorithm then allows to solve the correspondence problem between the graphs. From these correspondences between similar parts of the objects, we infer a set of matched points and finally estimate the transformation between the two objects through a robust matching algorithm. Synthetic results are presented."

Usually, each algorithm is tested on a different (small) database of 3D models, and thus no direct comparison is available for competing methods. We describe the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), a publicly available database of polygonal models collected from the World Wide Web and a suite of tools for comparing shape matching and classification algorithms. One feature of the benchmark is that it provides multiple semantic labels for each 3D model. For instance, it includes one classification of the 3D models based on function, another that considers function and form, and others based on how the object was constructed (e.g., man-made versus natural objects). We find that experiments with these classifications can expose different properties of shape-based retrieval algorithms. For example, out of 12 shape descriptors tested, extended Gaussian images by B. Horn (1984) performed best for distinguishing man-made from natural objects, while they performed among the worst for distinguishing specific object types. Based on experiments with several different shape descriptors, we conclude that no single descriptor is best for all classifications, and thus the main contribution of this paper is to provide a framework to determine the conditions under which each descriptor performs best."

A challenging aspect of this problem is to find a suitable shape signature that can be constructed and compared quickly, while still discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes. In this paper, we propose and analyze a method for computing shape signatures for arbitrary (possibly degenerate) 3D polygonal models. The key idea is to represent the signature of an object as a shape distribution sampled from a shape function measuring the global geometric properties of an object. The primary motivation for this approach is to reduce the shape matching problem to the comparison of probability distributions, which is simpler than traditional shape matching methods that require pose registration, feature correspondence or model fitting. We find that the dissimilarities between sampled distributions of simple shape functions (e.g. the distance between two random points on a surface) provide a robust method for discriminating between classes of objects (e.g. cars versus airplanes) in a moderately sized database, despite the presence of arbitrary translations, rotations, scales, reflections, tessellations, simplifications and model degeneracies. They can be evaluated quickly, and thus the proposed method could be applied as a pre-classifier in an object recognition system or in an interactive content-based retrieval application."

We first find points of interest in the intensity data that comes with each range image. Then we perform a triangulation of the 3D range points associated with these 2D interest points. All possible pairs of triangles between the two 3D triangulations are then matched. The fact that we have 3D data available makes it possible to efficiently prune matches. We do this pruning by using a simple and effective set of compatibility tests between potentially matching triangles and vertices. The best match is the one that aligns the largest number of interest points between the two range images. The algorithms are demonstrated experimentally on a number of different range image pairs."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

In this paper, we propose a common framework, spacetime stereo, which unifies many of these previous methods. Viewing specific techniques as special cases of this general framework leads to insights regarding the solutions to many of the traditional problems of individual techniques. Specifically, we discuss a number of innovative possible applications such as improved recovery of static scenes under variable illumination, spacetime stereo for moving objects, structured light and laser scanning with multiple simultaneous stripes or patterns, and laser scanning of shiny objects. To suggest the practical utility of the framework, we use it to analyze one of these applications: recovery of static scenes under variable, but uncontrolled, illumination. Based on our analysis, we show that methods derived from the spacetime stereo framework can be used to recover depth in situations in which existing methods perform poorly."

Unfortunately, traditional text-based search techniques are not always effective for 3D data. In this article, we investigate new shape-based search methods. The key challenges are to develop query methods simple enough for novice users and matching algorithms robust enough to work for arbitrary polygonal models. We present a Web-based search engine system that supports queries based on 3D sketches, 2D sketches, 3D models, and/or text keywords. For the shape-based queries, we have developed a new matching algorithm that uses spherical harmonics to compute discriminating similarity measures without requiring repair of model degeneracies or alignment of orientations. It provides 46 to 245% better performance than related shape-matching methods during precision--recall experiments, and it is fast enough to return query results from a repository of 20,000 models in under a second. The net result is a growing interactive index of 3D models available on the Web (i.e., a Google for 3D models)."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

However, inference and learning in general Markov networks is intractable. In this paper, we focus on learning a large subclass of such models (called associative Markov networks) that are tractable or closely approximable. This subclass contains networks of discrete variables with K labels each and clique potentials that favor the same labels for all variables in the clique. Such networks capture the \"guilt by association\" pattern of reasoning present in many domains, in which connected (\"associated\") variables tend to have the same label. Our approach exploits a linear programming relaxation for the task of finding the best joint assignment in such networks, which provides an approximate quadratic program (QP) for the problem of learning a margin-maximizing Markov network. We show that for associative Markov network over binary-valued variables, this approximate QP is guaranteed to return an optimal parameterization for Markov networks of arbitrary topology. For the nonbinary case, optimality is not guaranteed, but the relaxation produces good solutions in practice. Experimental results with hypertext and newswire classification show significant advantages over standard approaches."

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."
