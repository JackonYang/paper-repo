In contrast, harmonic analysis has thus far had little impact in modern problems involving high dimensional data, or data encoded as graphs or networks. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a harmonic analysis approach, including both learning algorithms and supporting theory, applicable to these more general settings. Given data (be it high dimensional, graph or network) that is represented by one or more hierarchical trees, we first construct multi-scale wavelet-like orthonormal bases on it. Second, we prove that in analogy to the Euclidean case, function smoothness with respect to a specific metric induced by the tree is equivalent to exponential rate of coefficient decay, that is, to approximate sparsity. These results readily translate to simple practical algorithms for various learning tasks. We present an application to transductive semi-supervised learning."

In this paper, we define generalized translation and modulation operators for signals on graphs, and use these operators to adapt the classical windowed Fourier transform to the graph setting, enabling vertex-frequency analysis. When we apply this transform to a signal with frequency components that vary along a path graph, the resulting spectrogram matches our intuition from classical discrete-time signal processing. Yet, our construction is fully generalized and can be applied to analyze signals on any undirected, connected, weighted graph."

In this paper we describe a similar tradeoff for signals defined on graphs. We describe the notions of \u201cspread\u201d in the graph and spectral domains, using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian as a surrogate Fourier basis. We then describe how to find signals that, among all signals with the same spectral spread, have the smallest graph spread about a given vertex. For every possible spectral spread, the desired signal is the solution to an eigenvalue problem. Since localization in graph and spectral domains is a desirable property of the elements of wavelet frames on graphs, we compare the performance of some existing wavelet transforms to the obtained bound."

We introduce novel techniques for measuring distances between graphs in a multiscale fashion, in such a way that such distances reflect changes at different levels of granularity, are easily localized to regions of the graph, and, when considered at a fixed scale, are robust with respect to changes and finer scales. These distances, or similarity measures, are based on random walks on graphs at multiple time scales. We then employ these notions to analyze time series of graphs, and show that on simple models of graphs that possess a natural multiscale structure, our algorithms have desirable properties of sensitivity and robustness.

These objects from differential geometry and analysis on manifolds have proven useful in applications to partial differential equations, and their discrete counterparts have been applied to optimization problems, learning, clustering, routing and many other algorithms.1\u22127 The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are in general global: their support often coincides with the whole manifold, and they are affected by global properties of the manifold (for example certain global topological invariants). Recently a framework for building natural multiresolution structures on manifolds and graphs was introduced, that greatly generalizes, among other things, the construction of wavelets and wavelet packets in Euclidean spaces.8,9 This allows the study of the manifold and of functions on it at different scales, which are naturally induced by the geometry of the manifold. This construction proceeds bottom-up, from the finest scale to the coarsest scale, using powers of a diffusion operator as dilations and a numerical rank constraint to critically sample the multiresolution subspaces. In this paper we introduce a novel multiscale construction, based on a top-down recursive partitioning induced by the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. This yields associated local cosine packets on manifolds, generalizing local cosines in Euclidean spaces.10 We discuss some of the connections with the construction of diffusion wavelets. These constructions have direct applications to the approximation, denoising, compression and learning of functions on a manifold and are promising in view of applications to problems in manifold approximation, learning, dimensionality reduction."

We create three new multiscale methods that provide wavelet\u2010like transforms both for data arising on graphs and for irregularly spaced spatial data in more than one dimension. The concept of scale still exists within these transforms, but as a continuous quantity rather than dyadic levels. Further, we adapt recent empirical Bayesian shrinkage techniques to enable us to perform multiscale shrinkage for function estimation both on graphs and for irregular spatial data. We demonstrate that our methods perform very well when compared with several other methods for spatial regression for both real and simulated data. Although we concentrate on multiscale shrinkage (regression) we present our new \u2018wavelet transforms\u2019 as generic tools intended to be the basis of methods that might benefit from a multiscale representation of data either on graphs or for irregular spatial data."

These graph based functions are referred to as graph-signals as we build a framework in which many concepts from the classical signal processing domain, such as Fourier decomposition, signal filtering and downsampling can be extended to graph domain. Especially, we observe a spectral folding phenomenon in bipartite graphs which occurs during downsampling of these graphs and produces aliasing in graph signals. This property of bipartite graphs, allows us to design critically sampled two-channel filter banks, and we propose quadrature mirror filters (referred to as graph-QMF) for bipartite graph which cancel aliasing and lead to perfect reconstruction. For arbitrary graphs we present a bipartite subgraph decomposition which produces an edge-disjoint collection of bipartite subgraphs. Graph-QMFs are then constructed on each bipartite subgraph leading to \u201cmulti-dimensional\u201d separable wavelet filter banks on graphs. Our proposed filter banks are critically sampled and we state necessary and sufficient conditions for orthogonality, aliasing cancellation and perfect reconstruction. The filter banks are realized by Chebychev polynomial approximations."

While most existing traffic analysis methods are fundamentally temporal, there is a clear need for the analysis of traffic across multiple network links - that is, for spatial traffic analysis. In this paper we give examples of problems that can be addressed via spatial traffic analysis. We then propose a formal approach to spatial traffic analysis based on the wavelet transform. Our approach (graph wavelets) generalizes the traditional wavelet transform so that it can be applied to data elements connected via an arbitrary graph topology. We explore the necessary and desirable properties of this approach and consider some of its possible realizations. We then apply graph wavelets to measurements from an operating network. Our results show that graph wavelets are very useful for our motivating problems; for example, they can be used to form highly summarized views of an entire network's traffic load, to gain insight into a network's global traffic response to a link failure, and to localize the extent of a failure event within the network."

The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists of minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses a discrete weighted -Dirichlet energy and an approximation one. This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted -Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter. It works with equal ease on regular 2-D and 3-D images, manifolds or any data. We illustrate the abilities of the approach by applying it to various types of images, meshes, manifolds, and data represented as graphs."

These graph based functions, referred to as graph-signals, provide a flexible model for representing many datasets with arbitrary location and connectivity. An application area considered in that work is image-processing, where pixels can be connected with their neighbors to form undirected graphs. In this paper, we propose various graph-formulations of images, which capture both directionality and intrinsic edge-information. The proposed graph-wavelet filterbanks provide a sparse, edge-aware representation of image-signals. Our preliminary results in non-linear approximation and denoising using graphs show promising gains over standard separable wavelet filterbank designs."

                "text": "Recent work by some of the authors presented a novel construction of a multiresolution analysis on manifolds and graphs, acted upon by a given symmetric Markov semigroup {Tt}t\u22650, for which Tt has low rank for large t. This includes important classes of diffusion-like operators, in any dimension, on manifolds, graphs, and in nonhomogeneous media. The dyadic powers of an operator are used to induce a multiresolution analysis, analogous to classical Littlewood-Paley and wavelet theory, while associated wavelet packets can also be constructed. This extends multiscale function and operator analysis and signal processing to a large class of spaces, such as manifolds and graphs, with efficient algorithms. Powers and functions of T (notably its Green's function) are efficiently computed, represented and compressed. This construction is related and generalizes certain Fast Multipole Methods, the wavelet representation of Calderon-Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, and also relates to algebraic multigrid techniques. The original diffusion wavelet construction yields orthonormal bases for multiresolution spaces {Vj}. The orthogonality requirement has some advantages from the numerical perspective, but several drawbacks in terms of the space and frequency localization of the basis functions. Here we show how to relax this requirement in order to construct biorthogonal bases of diffusion scaling functions and wavelets. This yields more compact representations of the powers of the operator, better localized basis functions. This new construction also applies to non self-adjoint semigroups, arising in many applications."

Our construction, which is based on a Markov random walk on the data, offers a general scheme of simultaneously reorganizing and subsampling graphs and arbitrarily shaped data sets in high dimensions using intrinsic geometry. We show that clustering in embedding spaces is equivalent to compressing operators. The objective of data partitioning and clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some accuracy.

The proposed method features approximations of the graph Fourier multipliers by shifted Chebyshev polynomials, whose recurrence relations make them readily amenable to distributed computation. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in a distributed denoising task, and show that the communication requirements of the method scale gracefully with the size of the network."

We use diffusion semigroups to generate multiscale geometries in order to organize and represent complex structures. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions or scaling functions of Markov matrices, which describe local transitions, lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newtonian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration. We provide a unified view of ideas from data analysis, machine learning, and numerical analysis."

The detail and approximation coefficients computed from this graph transform can be interpreted similarly to their counterparts in standard signal processing process. Our approach is based on partitioning all nodes in the graph into two sets, containing \"even\" and \"odd\" nodes, respectively. Then, as in standard lifting, nodes of one parity are used to predict/update those of the other. We discuss the even-odd assignment problem on the graph and provide a solution that is well suited to construct the transform. As an example we discuss how our transform could be used in a denoising application. I. I NTRODUCTION"

                "text": "A major consideration we had in writing this survey was to make it accessible to mathematicians as well as to computer scientists, since expander graphs, the protagonists of our story, come up in numerous and often surprising contexts in both fields. But, perhaps, we should start with a few words about graphs in general. They are, of course, one of the prime objects of study in Discrete Mathematics. However, graphs are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. In the natural and social sciences they model relations among species, societies, companies, etc. In computer science, they represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices as well as the flow of computation, and more. In mathematics, Cayley graphs are useful in Group Theory. Graphs carry a natural metric and are therefore useful in Geometry, and though they are \u201cjust\u201d one-dimensional complexes, they are useful in certain parts of Topology, e.g. Knot Theory. In statistical physics, graphs can represent local connections between interacting parts of a system, as well as the dynamics of a physical process on such systems. The study of these models calls, then, for the comprehension of the significant structural properties of the relevant graphs. But are there nontrivial structural properties which are universally important? Expansion of a graph requires that it is simultaneously sparse and highly connected. Expander graphs were first defined by Bassalygo and Pinsker, and their existence first proved by Pinsker in the early \u201970s. The property of being an expander seems significant in many of these mathematical, computational and physical contexts. It is not surprising that expanders are useful in the design and analysis of communication networks. What is less obvious is that expanders have surprising utility in other computational settings such as in the theory of error correcting codes and the theory of pseudorandomness. In mathematics, we will encounter e.g. their role in the study of metric embeddings, and in particular in work around the Baum-Connes Conjecture. Expansion is closely related to the convergence rates of Markov Chains, and so they play a key role in the study of Monte-Carlo algorithms in statistical mechanics and in a host of practical computational applications. The list of such interesting and fruitful connections goes on and on with so many applications we will not even"

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.\n"

Power consumption for communication between sensor network nodes typically dominates over that for local data processing, so it is often more efficient to process data in the network than it is to send data to a remote, central collection point for analysis. Distributed wavelet analysis represents one such technique, whereby local collaboration among nodes de-correlates measurements, yielding a sparser data set with fewer significant values. This sparsity can then be leveraged to suppress errors in nodes\u2019 measurements, which are typically gathered by inexpensive sensors subject to measurement noise. In this paper, we briefly review the details of a distributed wavelet processing protocol for sensor networks based on the theory of lifting, and we develop a suite of wavelet de-noising protocols for distributed de-noising of measurements. We illustrate the effectiveness of the system with a series of numeric examples."

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection.

We consider the problem of reconstructing the original data by only transmitting M \u226a N sensor readings while guaranteeing that the reconstruction error is small. Assuming the original signal is \u201csmooth\u201d with respect to the network topology, our approach is to gather measurements from a random subset of nodes and then interpolate with respect to the graph Laplacian eigenbasis, leveraging ideas from compressed sensing. We propose algorithms for both temporally and spatially correlated signals, and the performance of these algorithms is verified using both synthesized data and real world data. Significant savings are made in terms of energy resources, bandwidth, and query latency."

The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists in minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses the discrete p-Laplace operator, and an approximation one. This formulation leads to a family of simple nonlinear filters, parameterized by the degree p of smoothness and by the graph weight function. Some of these filters provide a graph-based version of well-known filters used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal mean filter."

Power consumption for communication between sensor network nodes typically dominates over that for local data processing, so it is often more efficient to process data in the network than it is to send data to a remote, central collection point for analysis. Distributed wavelet analysis represents one such technique, whereby local collaboration among nodes de-correlates measurements, yielding a sparser data set with fewer significant values. This sparsity can then be leveraged to suppress errors in nodes' measurements, which are typically gathered by inexpensive sensors subject to measurement noise. In this paper, we briefly review the details of a distributed wavelet processing protocol for sensor networks based on the theory of lifting, and we develop a suite of wavelet de-noising protocols for distributed de-noising of measurements. We illustrate the effectiveness of the system with a series of numeric examples"

A global querier (such as a mobile collector or unmanned aerial vehicle) can obtain a lossy to lossless representation of the network data, according to the desired resolution. A local querier (such as a sensor node) can also obtain either large-scale trends or local details, by querying its immediate neighborhood. We want the encoding to be robust to arbitrary, even time-varying, wireless communication connectivity graphs. Thus we want to avoid cluster heads or deterministic hierarchies that are not robust to single points of failure. We propose a randomized encoding which enables both robustness, and distributed computation that does not require long distance coordination or awareness of network connectivity at individual sensors. Our distributed encoding algorithm operates on local neighborhoods of the communication graph"

Moreover, when used in wireless sensor networks, these transforms can also leverage data received at nodes via broadcast wireless communications. Various constructions of unidirectional transforms are also provided for use in data gathering in wireless sensor networks. New wavelet transforms are also proposed which provide significant improvements over existing unidirectional transforms."

Such an estimation problem is generally referred to as transductive inference. It is well-known that many meaningful inductive or supervised methods can be derived from a regularization framework, which minimizes a loss function plus a regularization term. In the same spirit, we propose a general discrete regularization framework defined on finite object sets, which can be thought of as discrete analogue of classical regularization theory. A family of transductive inference schemes is then systemically derived from the framework, including our earlier algorithm for transductive inference, with which we obtained encouraging results on many practical classification problems. The discrete regularization framework is built on discrete analysis and geometry developed by ourselves, in which a number of discrete differential operators of various orders are constructed, which can be thought of as discrete analogues of their counterparts in the continuous case."

                "text": "Sparse and redundant representation modeling of data assumes an ability to describe signals as linear combinations of a few atoms from a pre-specified dictionary. As such, the choice of the dictionary that sparsifies the signals is crucial for the success of this model. In general, the choice of a proper dictionary can be done using one of two ways: i) building a sparsifying dictionary based on a mathematical model of the data, or ii) learning a dictionary to perform best on a training set. In this paper we describe the evolution of these two paradigms. As manifestations of the first approach, we cover topics such as wavelets, wavelet packets, contourlets, and curvelets, all aiming to exploit 1-D and 2-D mathematical models for constructing effective dictionaries for signals and images. Dictionary learning takes a different route, attaching the dictionary to a set of examples it is supposed to serve. From the seminal work of Field and Olshausen, through the MOD, the K-SVD, the Generalized PCA and others, this paper surveys the various options such training has to offer, up to the most recent contributions and structures."

We present a heuristic algorithm based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Eigenvectors point out ``bipartite-looking'''' subgraphs that are used to refine the coloring to a valid coloring. The algorithm optimally colors complete $k$-partite graphs and certain other classes of graphs with regular structure."

                "text": "In this first chapter we give a concise treatment of the theory of matrix functions, concentrating on those aspects that are most useful in the development of algorithms. Most of the results in this chapter are for general functions. Results specific to particular functions can be found in later chapters devoted to those functions. The term \" function of a matrix \" can have several different meanings. In this book we are interested in a definition that takes a scalar function f and a matrix A \u2208 C n\u00d7n and specifies f (A) to be a matrix of the same dimensions as A; it does so in a way that provides a useful generalization of the function of a scalar variable f (z), z \u2208 C. Other interpretations of f (A) that are not our focus here are as follows: \u2022 Elementwise operations on matrices, for example sin A = (sin a ij). These operations are available in some programming languages. For example, Fortran 95 supports \" elemental operations \" [423, \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739], and most of MATLAB's elementary and special functions are applied in an elementwise fashion when given matrix arguments. However, elementwise operations do not integrate well with matrix algebra, as is clear from the fact that the elementwise square of A is not equal to the matrix product of A with itself. (Nevertheless, the elementwise product of two matrices, known as the Hadamard product or Schur product, is a useful concept [294, \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730], [296, \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf731, Chap. 5].) \u2022 Functions producing a scalar result, such as the trace, the determinant, the spectral radius, the condition number \u03ba(A) = A A \u22121 , and one particular generalization to matrix arguments of the hypergeometric function [359, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736]. \u2022 Functions mapping C n\u00d7n to C m\u00d7m that do not stem from a scalar function. Examples include matrix polynomials with matrix coefficients, the matrix transpose , the adjugate (or adjoint) matrix, compound matrices comprising minors of a given matrix, and factors from matrix factorizations. However, as a special case, the polar factors of a matrix are treated in Chapter 8. \u2022 Functions mapping C to C n\u00d7n , such as the transfer function f (t) = B(tI \u2212 A) \u22121 C, for B \u2208 C n\u00d7m , A \u2208 C m\u00d7m , and C \u2208 C m\u00d7n. Before giving formal definitions, we offer some motivating remarks. When f (t) is a polynomial or rational \u2026"

The main focus of this paper is, first, to define a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm addressing the preservation of structure in a digital image. The mathematical analysis is based on the analysis of the \"method noise,\" defined as the difference between a digital image and its denoised version.

Simple thresholding operations, applied in the unconditional basis, work essentially better for compressing, estimating, and recovering than they do in any other orthogonal basis. In fact, simple thresholding in an unconditional basis works essentially better for recovery and estimation than other methods, period. (Performance is measured in an asymptotic minimax sense.) As an application, we formalize and prove Mallat\u2032s Heuristic, which says that wavelet bases are optimal for representing functions containing singularities, when there may be an arbitrary number of singularities, arbitrarily distributed."

By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration."

The recursive spectral bisection method (RSB) has been shown to be very effective for such partitioning problems compared to alternative methods, but RSB in its simplest form is expensive. Here a multilevel version of RSB is introduced that attains about an order-of-magnitude improvement in run time on typical examples. 1. INTRODUCTION Unstructured meshes are used in several large-scale scientific and engineering problems, including finite-volume methods for computational fluid dynamics and finite-element methods for structural analysis. If unstructured problems such as these are to be solved on distributed-memory parallel computers, their data structures must be partitioned and distributed across processors; if they are to be solved efficiently, the partitioning must niaximize load balance and minimize interprocessor communication. Recently, the recursive spectral bisection method (RSB)[l] has been shown to be very effective for such partitioning problems compared to alternative methods. Unfortunately, RSB in its simplest form is expensive. We shall describe a multilevel version of RSB that attains about im order-of-magnitude improvement in run time on typical examples."

We show that machine-generated decision rules appear comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation. In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%.

We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data."

                "text": "There has been a continuing increase in the amount of data handled by database management systems (DBMSs) in recent years. Indeed, it is no longer unusual for a DBMS to manage databases ranging in size from hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes. This massive increase in database sizes is coupled with a growing need for DBMSs to exhibit more sophisticated functionality such as the support of object-oriented, deductive, and multimediabased applications. In many cases, these new requirements have rendered existing DBMSs unable to provide the necessary system performance, especially given that many mainframe DBMSs already have difficulty meeting the I/O and CPU performance requirements of traditional information systems that service large numbers of concurrent users and/or handle massive amounts of data [13]. To achieve the required performance levels, database systems have been increasingly required to make use of parallelism. As noted in [1], the traditional approach to parallelism for conventional DBMSs which use industry-standard database models such as the relational, can take one of two forms. The first is through the use of massively parallel general-purpose hardware platforms. As an example of this, commercial platforms such as nCube and SP1 are now supporting Oracle's parallel server [5]. Also, the Distributed Array Processor marketed by Cambridge Parallel Processing is now being used to produce a commercial massively parallel database system [4]. The second approach makes use of arrays of off-the-shelf components to form custom massively parallel systems. For the most part, these hardware systems are based onMIMD parallel architectures. The NCR 3700 [1] and the Super Database Computer II (SDC-II) [27] are two such systems. The NCR 3700 uses a high-performance multistage interconnection network known as Bynet and RAIDS (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks [11]). This system can now run a parallel version of Sybase relational DBMS [5, 26]. The SDC-II consists of eight data processing modules, where each module is composed of seven processors and five disk drives. The data processing modules communicate through an omega interconnection network."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."
