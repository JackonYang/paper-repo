The word templates are obtained from a statistical clustering analysis of a large data base consisting of 100 replications of each word (i.e. once by each of 100 talkers). The recognition system, which uses telephone recordings, is based on an LPC analysis of the unknown word, dynamic time warping of each reference template to the unknown word (using the Itakura LPC distance measure), and the application of a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) decision rule to lower the probability of error. Results are presented on two test sets of data which show error rates that are comparable to, or better than, those obtained with speaker trained, isolated word recognition systems."

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

In this paper we approach the problem from an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP). For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level search control. The details of each of the subparts and their interaction during the decoding process are discussed."

The only drawback to this method was the extensive, burdensome training required for the statistical analysis. Since the statistical training method could not be used in most practical situations, techniques were investigated for obtaining a simplified, robust training procedure which would incorporate many of the ideas of the statistical approach.

                "text": "Recognition of isolated words by encoding speech into linear predictive coefficients (LPC) is well known and widely accepted as one of the better methods for speech recognition. One of the drawbacks in relying entirely on LPC measures for recognition, however, is that the energy information in the speech is removed during the LPC analysis. Consequently, attempts have been made to include energy pattern information along with the LPC pattern information to achieve greater recognition accuracy. This paper discusses problems involved in combining energy pattern information with the LPC pattern information and presents results of recognition experiments with one method. The energy information and LPC information are combined linearly in a (speech) frame-by-frame manner utilizing the dynamic time warping (DTW) method time alignment. The LPC log likelihood ratio distance function, which determines the spectral difference between two frames of speech, does not lend itself to direct statistical analysis in multiple dimensions. The method for obtaining the weighting for the linear combination involves an iterative minimization of a probability of error function. The combined energy and LPC distance function was tested using a 129-word \u201cairline\u201d vocabulary, which is designed for speaker-independent, isolated word recognition. The inclusion of energy information in the recognition feature space reduces recognition error rates by an average of about 25 percent as compared with LPC alone."

It is the purpose of this paper to outline two aspects of speech-recognition research. First, we discuss word recognition as a classical pattern-recognition problem and show how some fundamental concepts of signal processing, information theory, and computer science can be combined to give us the capability of robust recognition of isolated words and simple connected word sequences. We then describe methods whereby these principles, augmented by modern theories of formal language and semantic analysis, can be used to study some of the more general problems in speech recognition. It is anticipated that these methods will ultimately lead to accurate mechanical recognition of fluent speech under certain controlled conditions."

The measurements made on the speech waveform include energy, zero crossings, two-pole linear predictive coding analysis, and normalized error of the linear predictive coding analysis. A formal evaluation of the systems showed an error rate of 2.7 percent for a carefully controlled recording environment and a 5.6 percent error rate for on-line recordings in a noisy computer room."

A time series is represented as a sample sequence generated by a finite state hidden Markov model with output densities parameterized by linear prediction polynomials and error variances. These objects are defined and their properties developed. The theory culminates in a theorem that provides a computationally efficient iterative scheme to improve the model. The theorem has been used to create models from speech signals of considerable length. One such model is examined with emphasis on the relationship between states of the model and traditional classes of speech events. A use of the method is illustrated by an application to the talker verification problem."

The endpoint detection problem is nontrivial for nonstationary backgrounds where artifacts (i.e., nonspeech events) may be introduced by the speaker, the recording environment, and the transmission system. Several techniques for the detection of the endpoints of isolated words recorded over a dialed-up telephone line were studied. The techniques were broadly classified as either explicit, implicit, or hybrid in concept. The explicit techniques for endpoint detection locate the endpoints prior to and independent of the recognition and decision stages of the system. For the implicit methods, the endpoints are determined solely by the recognition and decision stages of the system, i.e., there is no separate stage for endpoint detection. The hybrid techniques incorporate aspects from both the explicit and implicit methods. Investigations showed that the hybrid techniques consistently provided the best estimates for both of the word endpoints and, correspondingly, the highest recognition accuracy of the three classes studied. A hybrid end-point detector is proposed which gives a rejection rate of less than 0.5 percent, while providing recognition accuracy close to that obtained from hand-edited endpoints."

In this type of system the machine responds to the mode of communications preferred by the user, rather than vice versa. Many practical applications exist today for limited capability voice input systems. The first operational voice input systems have taken place with limited vocabulary, isolated word voice input systems. Most of these initial systems were for industrial applications in which the users' hands or eyes were already busy with their normal work requirements. Future developments in both new applications and increased capability voice input systems can be expected to considerably expand the usage of this form of man-machine communications."

Repeated use of a simple abstract model produces a system which is simple in structure, but powerful in capabilities."
