First, they address the issue of how to perform OCR on omnifont and multi-style data, such as plain and italic, without the need to have a separate model for each style. The amount of training data from each style, which is used to train a single model, becomes an important issue in the face of the conditional independence assumption inherent in the use of HMMs. They demonstrate mathematically and empirically how to allocate training data among the different styles to alleviate this problem. Second, they show how to use a word-based HMM system to perform character recognition with unlimited vocabulary. The method includes the use of a trigram language model on character sequences. Using all these techniques, they have achieved character error rates of 1.1% on data from the University of Washington English Document Image Database and 3.3% on data from the DARPA Arabic OCR Corpus."

But in image-based handwriting recognition, this conclusion is far from being firmly established, and the results presented in this paper show that systems employing character-level presegmentation can be more effective, even within the same HMM paradigm, than systems relying on sliding window feature extraction. We describe two variants of a hidden Markov system recognizing handwritten addresses on US mail, one with presegmentation and one without, and report results on the CEDAR data set."

Many interesting details of a 50,000 vocabulary recognition system for US city names are described. This system includes feature extraction, classification, estimation of model parameters, and word recognition. The feature extraction module transforms a binary image to a sequence of feature vectors. The classification module consists of a transformation based on linear discriminant analysis and Gaussian soft-decision vector quantizers which transform feature vectors into sets of symbols and associated likelihoods. Symbols and likelihoods form the input to both HMM training and recognition. HMM training performed in several successive steps requires only a small amount of gestalt labeled data on the level of characters for initialization. HMM recognition based on the Viterbi algorithm runs on subsets of the whole vocabulary.<<ETX>>"

Reported results can be good enough to lead one to believe that this is a \"solved problem\". Closer analysis reveals test data that is often limited in its range of fonts and point sizes. Worse still, results are commonly quoted for noise-free images, ignoring the problems of recognising \"real\" documents such as faxes. Various methods have been proposed for modelling characters with Hidden Markov Models. The authors, amongst others, have suggested representing a character by analysing the pixel pattern in columns of its image, and linking sequential column patterns together with a HMM. In this paper we propose a method of quantising the patterns by means of a Shift Invariant Hamming Distance. A full experimental evaluation (45 fonts, 5 point sizes) in typical noise results in a recognition accuracy of 99% in the top-3 choices, and 94% top-choice for the best font. The method has a significant advantage in recognising noisy word images, due to classification being achieved without a prior segmentation of the word into characters."

A structural analysis algorithm is used to segment a word into sub-character segments irrespective of the character boundaries, and to identify the primitive features in each segment such as strokes and arcs. The states of the HMM for each character are statistically represented by the sub-character segments and the state characteristics are obtained by determining the state probability functions based on the training samples. A level-building dynamic programming algorithm combines word-segmentation and recognition in one operation and chooses the best probable grouping of characters for recognition of an unknown word. The computer experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the system for recognizing words formed by degraded and connected characters.<<ETX>>"

The N-best Paradigm computes alternative hypotheses for a sentence, which can later be rescored using more detailed and more expensive knowledge sources. We present and compare many algorithms for finding the N-best sentence hypotheses, and suggest which are the most efficient and accurate. The Forward-Backward Search performs a time-synchronous forward search that finds all of the words that are likely to end at each frame within an utterance. Then, a second more expensive search can be performed in the backward direction, restricting its attention to those words found in the forward pass."

A reduction in the word error rate by more than a factor of 5 and an increase in recognition speeds by several orders of magnitude (brought about by a combination of faster recognition search algorithms and more powerful computers), have combined to make high-accuracy, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition for large vocabularies possible in real time, on off-the-shelf workstations, without the aid of special hardware. These advances promise to make speech recognition technology readily available to the general public. This paper focuses on the speech recognition advances made through better speech modeling techniques, chiefly through more accurate mathematical modeling of speech sounds."

The present work explores two different approaches to solve the cursive problem. The first approach depends upon preprocessing to segment connected characters. The other approach is a segmentation-free technique where whole portions of connected characters are recognized without prior segmentation. Both methods employ hidden Markov models for classification. The present paper investigates the robustness of the two techniques and suggests how to combine them so that the weakness of one is compensated for by the strength of the other."

A geometrical and topological feature analysis method is developed for segmentation and feature extraction stages. Chain code transformation is applied to main strokes of the characters which are then classified by the hidden Markov model (HMM) in the recognition stage.

The independent quantization of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar quantization, while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts employed in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment of its benefits and costs when compared to scalar quantization. Vector quantization is presented as a process of redundancy removal that makes effective use of four interrelated properties of vector parameters: linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape of the probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself. In contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear dependency and pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means of simple examples and the theoretical limits of vector quantizer performance are reviewed, based on results from rate-distortion theory. Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation, and performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the methods presented are quite general and can be used for the coding of arbitrary signals, this paper focuses primarily on the coding of speech signals and parameters."
