We describe the joint distribution between pairs of coefficients at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. Although the raw coefficients are nearly, uncorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. A linear magnitude predictor coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, provides a reasonable description of the conditional probability densities. We use this model to construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bit-plane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder. Bit-planes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. We demonstrate the quality of the statistical characterization by comparing rate-distortion curves of the coder to several standard coders."

                "text": "We present a statistical characterization of texture images in the context of an overcomplete complex wavelet transform. The characterization is based on empirical observations of statistical regularities in such images, and parameterized by (1) the local autocorrelation of the coe\u00c6cients in each subband; (2) both the local auto-correlation and cross-correlation of coe\u00c6cient magnitudes at other orientations and spatial scales; and (3) the rst few moments of the image pixel histogram. We develop an e\u00c6cient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints using alternated projections, and demonstrate its e ectiveness on a wide range of synthetic and natural textures. In particular, we show that many important structural elements in textures (e.g., edges, repeated patterns or alternated patches of simpler texture), can be captured through joint second order statistics of the coe\u00c6cient magnitudes. We also show the exibility of the representation, by applying to a variety of tasks which can be viewed as constrained image synthesis problems, such as spatial and spectral extrapolation. 1Instituto de Optica, CSIC, Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, SPAIN. iodpm79@pinar2.csic.es 2Center for Neural Science, and Courant Inst. of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, NY 10003. eero.simoncelli@nyu.edu JP is supported by a fellowship from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cienti cas (CSIC), and the Comision Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT, Spain), under grant TIC97-325.

Vision is arguably our most important sensory system, judging from both the ubiquity of visual forms of communication, and the large proportion of the human brain devoted to visual processing. Nevertheless, it has proven di\u00c6cult to establish a good mathematical de nition (in the form of a statistical model) for visual images. The set of visual images is enormous, and yet only a small fraction of these are likely to be encountered in a natural setting [43, 25, 19, 54]. Thus, a statistical prior model, even one that partially captures these variations in likelihood, can substantially bene t image processing and arti cial vision systems. In addition, many authors have proposed that biological visual systems have evolved to take advantage of the statistical properties of the signals to which they are exposed [e.g., 3, 4, 2], thus suggesting a direct link between image statistics and visual processing. In order to characterize visual images statistically, one must make some sort of restriction on the probability model. The most common assumptions are locality (the characterization is speci ed on local spatial neighborhoods), stationarity (the statistics depend only on relative spatial position within the image), and a parametric form for the density (e.g., Gaussian). The subclass of images that we commonly call \\visual texture\" seems most consistent with local stationary density models. Traditional de nitions of texture can be classi ed into \\structural\" and \\statistical\" [34], the rst consisting of a set of repeated deterministic features, and the second corresponding to a sample drawn from a probability density. Such a distinction has turned out to be somewhat arti cial: For example, Zhu et al. [69] have demonstrated that is possible to capture and reproduce structural elements in texture using purely statistical models. Furthermore, many real-world textures seem to incorporate both aspects, in that they can be described as a set of repeating structural elements subject to some randomness in their location, size, color, orientation, etc. This observation leads us to seek a single method of representing textures. In this paper, we develop a fully statistical description, and demonstrate that it is also able to capture and reproduce a wide variety of structural elements. Julesz pioneered the statistical characterization of textures by hypothesizing that the Nth-order joint empirical densities (for some unspeci ed N) of neighborhoods of image pixels, could be used to partition textures into classes that are indistinguishable to a human observer [40]. This work thus established the use of both the locality and stationarity assumptions, the goal of determining a minimal set of statistical constraints, and the validation of texture models using human observers. Since then, researchers have explored a wide variety of approaches for texture characterization and synthesis. One of the most basic distinctions between the various approaches is the choice of representation. Starting with Julesz, many authors have worked directly on the statistical attributes of local spatial neighborhoods of pixels, typically in the form of a Markov random eld [e.g., 35, 42, 17]. But most others attempt to simplify the description of the density by rst processing with a set of linear lters, such as Gabor lters or a multiscale basis. The use of localized multi-scale multi-orientation sets of bandpass lters is inspired by what is known of biological visual processing, and justi ed by recent studies of the higher-order statistical properties of such representations (we discuss this further in section 1). These lters may be held xed, or chosen adaptively depending on the image statistics [e.g., 10, 26, 22, 59, 51]. Assuming a preconditioning subband decomposition, most texture characterizations"

Specifically, we model image wavelet coefficients as being drawn from an independent generalized Gaussian distribution field, of fixed unknown shape for each subband, having zero mean and unknown slowly spatially-varying variances. Based on this model, we develop a powerful \"on the fly\" estimation-quantization (EQ) framework that consists of: (i) first finding the maximum-likelihood estimate of the individual spatially-varying coefficient field variances based on causal and quantized spatial neighborhood contexts; and (ii) then applying an off-line rate-distortion (R-D) optimized quantization/entropy coding strategy, implemented as a fast lookup table, that is optimally matched to the derived variance estimates. A distinctive feature of our paradigm is the dynamic switching between forward and backward adaptation modes based on the reliability of causal prediction contexts. The performance of our coder is extremely competitive with the best published results in the literature across diverse classes of images and target bitrates of interest, in both compression efficiency and processing speed. For example, our coder exceeds the objective performance of the best zerotree-based wavelet coder based on space-frequency-quantization at all bit rates for all tested images at a fraction of its complexity."

The overall ordering of bitplanes is determined by the ratio of their encoded variance to compressed size. We show rate-distortion comparisons of the coder to first and second-order theoretical entropy bounds and the EZW coder.

The fundamental reason for these advances is that the statistics of many natural signals, when decomposed in such bases, are substantially simplified. Choosing a basis that is adapted to statistical properties of the input signal is a classical problem. The traditional solution is principal components analysis (PCA), in which a linear decomposition is chosen to diagonalize the covariance structure of the input. The most well-known description of image statistics is that their Fourier spectra take the form of a power law [e.g., 1, 2, 3]. Coupled with a constraint of translation-invariance, this suggests that the Fourier transform is an appropriate PCA representation. Fourier and related representations are widely used in image processing applications. For example, the classical solution to the noise removal problem is the Wiener filter, which can be derived by assuming a signal model of decorrelated Gaussian-distributed coefficients in the Fourier domain."

First, a wavelet transform used in order to obtain a set of biorthogonal subclasses of images: the original image is decomposed at different scales using a pyramidal algorithm architecture. The decomposition is along the vertical and horizontal directions and maintains constant the number of pixels required to describe the image. Second, according to Shannon's rate distortion theory, the wavelet coefficients are vector quantized using a multiresolution codebook. To encode the wavelet coefficients, a noise shaping bit allocation procedure which assumes that details at high resolution are less visible to the human eye is proposed. In order to allow the receiver to recognize a picture as quickly as possible at minimum cost, a progressive transmission scheme is presented. It is shown that the wavelet transform is particularly well adapted to progressive transmission."

We use a simple uniform scalar quantizer to quantize the image subbands. Our algorithm puts the coefficient into one of several classes depending on the values of neighboring previously quantized coefficients. These previously quantized coefficients form contexts which are used to characterize the subband data. To each context type corresponds a different probability model and thus each subband coefficient is compressed with an arithmetic coder having the appropriate model depending on that coefficient's neighborhood. We show how the context selection can be driven by rate-distortion criteria, by choosing the contexts in a way that the total distortion for a given bit rate is minimized. Moreover the probability models for each context are initialized/updated in a very efficient way so that practically no overhead information has to be sent to the decoder. Our results are comparable or in some cases better than the recent state of the art, with our algorithm being simpler than most of the published algorithms of comparable performance."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

The embedded code represents a sequence of binary decisions that distinguish an image from the \"null\" image. Using an embedded coding algorithm, an encoder can terminate the encoding at any point thereby allowing a target rate or target distortion metric to be met exactly. Also, given a bit stream, the decoder can cease decoding at any point in the bit stream and still produce exactly the same image that would have been encoded at the bit rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. In addition to producing a fully embedded bit stream, the EZW consistently produces compression results that are competitive with virtually all known compression algorithms on standard test images. Yet this performance is achieved with a technique that requires absolutely no training, no pre-stored tables or codebooks, and requires no prior knowledge of the image source. The EZW algorithm is based on four key concepts: (1) a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition, (2) prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images, (3) entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and (4) universal lossless data compression which is achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding. >"

Fractal block coders have exploited the self-similarity among blocks in images. We devise an image coder in which the causal similarity among blocks of different subbands in a multiresolution decomposition of the image is exploited. In a pyramid subband decomposition, the image is decomposed into a set of subbands that are localized in scale, orientation, and space. The proposed coding scheme consists of predicting blocks in one subimage from blocks in lower resolution subbands with the same orientation. Although our prediction maps are of the same kind of those used in fractal block coders, which are based on an iterative mapping scheme, our coding technique does not impose any contractivity constraint on the block maps. This makes the decoding procedure very simple and allows a direct evaluation of the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and the reconstructed image at coding time. More importantly, we show that the subband pyramid acts as an automatic block classifier, thus making the block search simpler and the block matching more effective. These advantages are confirmed by the experimental results, which show that the performance of our scheme is superior for both visual quality and MSE to that obtainable with standard fractal block coders and also to that of other popular image coders such as JPEG."

Unfortunately, little in the way of practical algorithms or techniques have been published. We present a technique for image compression that is based on a very simple type of iterative fractal. In our algorithm a wavelet transform (quadrature mirror filter pyramid) is used to decompose an image into bands containing information from different scales (spatial frequencies) and orientations. The conditional probabilities between these different scale bands are then determined, and used as the basis for a predictive coder. We find that the wavelet transform's various scale and orientation bands have a great deal of redundant, self-similar structure. This redundant structure is, however, in the form of multi-modal conditional probabilities, so that linear predictors perform poorly. Our algorithm uses a simple histogram method to determine the multi-modal conditional probabilities between scales. The resulting predictive coder is easily integrated into existing subband coding schemes. Comparison of this fractal-based scheme with our standard wavelet vector coder on 256 X 256 grey-level imagery shows up to a two-fold gain in coding efficiency with no loss in image quality, and up to a four-fold gain with small loss in image quality. Coding and decoding are implemented by small table lookups, making real-time application feasible."

For computational reasons the set is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex."

Department of Mathematics, Dart-NONLINEAR WAVELET METHODS 203 Andrew Bruce and Carl Taswell for many discussions about wavelet software. The NMR datasets were provided by Chris Raphael (Figure 1) and Jee Hoch (Figure 11), the ESCA dataset by Jean-Paul Bib erian, the image dataset by Ingrid Daubechies, the seismic dataset by Paul Donoho. Many thanks to Tina Sharp for intense last-minute editorial work. Consider now a simple recursive nonlinear multiresolution scheme based on decimating by factors of 3. The ne-to-coarse mapping is obtained by grouping the signal in triplets of successive points, and replacing each group of three by a single number { the median of the group of 3. (This is a sort of nonlinear Haar analysis, since dyadic Haar wavelets correspond to grouping data in pairs and keeping only the mean of each pair.) This triadic nonlinear coarsening operator gives rise in an obvious way to a telescoping nonlinear multiresolution decomposition. Figure 28 shows the result of setting to zero the ne scale coeecients of this nonlinear triadic transform applied to the noisy data in Figure 26(b). This clearly performs much better than the linear recovery in Figure 27. Theoretical work to date on nonlinear multiresolution analysis has been done by Ron DeVore (S. Carolina) and Bradley Lucier (Purdue). Interesting applied work with mammograms has been done by Rich Richardson (Univ. of Texas at along with the author, have developed a variety of algorithms based on ideas from robust statistics.

It is a pleasure to thank Iain Johnstone, G erard Kerkyacharian, and Dominique Picard, with whom much of the theory described here has been developed , and to thank Yves Meyer, Ronald Coifman, and Ingrid Daubechies for encouragement at key moments. Speciic inspirations provided by the work of Ronald DeVore and Bjj orn Jawerth are also gratefully acknowledged, as well as stimulating conversations with Albert Cohen and Bradley Lucier. Thanks to NONLINEAR WAVELET METHODS 201 Of course, in Figure 25 we are showing what happens when the wavelet transform is segmented exactly at the point of discontinuity. How are we to obtain, in analyzing noisy data, information about the proper segmentation point? Viewing the collection of segmented wavelet transforms with diierent values of t as a collection of bases B (t) , this is really a problem of selecting a best basis. Therefore we propose a best-basis segmentation SURE(y; \u2026"

'Reversible' wavelets are nonlinear filters which implement exact-reconstruction systems with minimal precision integer arithmetic. Wavelet coefficients are encoded in a bit-significance embedded order, allowing lossy compression by truncating the compressed data. Lossless coding of wavelet coefficients is unique to CREW. In fact, most of the coded data is created by the lessor significant bits of the coefficients. CREW's context-based coding, called Horizon coding, takes advantage of the spatial and spectral information available in the wavelet domain and adapts well to the lessor significant bits. In applications where the size of an image is large, it is desirable to perform compression in one pass using far less workspace memory than the size of the image. A buffering scheme which allows a one-pass implementation with reasonable memory is described."

The new transformation is similar to the subband decomposition, but can be computed with only integer addition and bit-shift operations. During its calculation, the number of bits required to represent the transformed image is kept small through careful scaling and truncations. Numerical results show that the entropy obtained with the new transform is smaller than that obtained with predictive coding of similar complexity. In addition, we propose entropy-coding methods that exploit the multiresolution structure, and can efficiently compress the transformed image for progressive transmission (up to exact recovery). The lossless compression ratios are among the best in the literature, and simultaneously the rate versus distortion performance is comparable to those of the most efficient lossy compression methods."

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

The advantages of subband classification are characterized in a rate-distortion framework in terms of \"classification gain\" and overall \"subband classification gain.\" Two algorithms, maximum classification gain and equal mean-normalized standard deviation classification, which allow unequal number of blocks in each class, are presented. The dependence between the classification maps from different subbands is exploited either directly while encoding the classification maps or indirectly by constraining the classification maps. The trade-off between the classification gain and the amount of side information is explored. Coding results for a subband image coder based on classification are presented. The simulation results demonstrate the value of classification in subband coding."

Another advantage of MTWC is its lower computational complexity. The superior performance of MWC can be explained by examining the evolution of the distortion distribution in each subband as image data are compressed in the embedded coding process.

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

A more effective approach, however, is one where the subband coders are optimized jointly so that the average distortion introduced by the subband quantizers is minimized subject to a constraint on the output rate of the subband encoder. A subband coder with jointly optimized multistage residual quantizers and entropy coders is introduced and applied to image coding. The high performance of the coder is attributed to its ability to exploit statistical dependencies within and across the subbands. The efficiency of the multistage residual quantization structure and the effectiveness of the statistical modeling algorithm result in an attractive balance among the reproduction quality, rate, and complexity."

The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"

At high rates, the method performs within 0.5 dB of the rate-distortion bound for the family of generalized Gaussian densities. A simple modification of the uniform codebook is shown to result in improved performance at low bit rates. The arithmetic and trellis coding method is used for encoding image subbands.

They derive a signal energy distribution in the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference terms, unlike Wigner and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit isolates the signal structures that are coherent with respect to a given dictionary. An application to pattern extraction from noisy signals is described.

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."
