Here \u201creduced\u201d means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed."

Finer distinctions about the computational relationships among natural problems can be made than in previous formulations and some negative results are proved."

In modern lanuage he considered the random graph G(n,.5) as described below. For each k-set S let BS denote the \u201cbad\u201d events that S is either a clique or an independent set. Then Pr[BS] = 21-(k/2) so that \u03a3Pr[BS] < 1, hence \u2227\\( \\wedge {\\bar B_s}\\) \u2260 \u2205 and a graph satisfying \u2227\\( \\wedge {\\bar B_s}\\) must exist."

The proposed model makes possible a study of learning that reconciles three requirements: the classes of concepts that can be learnt are relevant for general purpose knowledge; they can be characterized; the process of learning them is computationally feasible."
