A set of dependency structures used for training and testing the parser is obtained from a treebank of CCG normal-form derivations, which have been derived (semi-) automatically from the Penn Treebank. The parser correctly recovers over 80% of labelled dependencies, and around 90% of unlabelled dependencies."

The supertagger reduces the derivation space over which model estimation is performed, reducing the space required for discriminative training. It also dramatically increases the speed of the parser. We show that large increases in speed can be obtained by tightly integrating the supertagger with the CCG grammar and parser. This is the first work we are aware of to successfully integrate a supertagger with a full parser which uses an automatically extracted grammar. We also further reduce the derivation space using constraints on category combination. The result is an accurate wide-coverage CCG parser which is an order of magnitude faster than comparable systems for other linguistically motivated formalisms."

We compare models which use all CCG derivations, including non-standard derivations, with normal-form models. The performances of the two models are comparable and the results are competitive with existing wide-coverage CCG parsers."

The addition of such information was intended to facilitate the process of predicate-argument extraction. However, even with the enriched annotation this task is far from trivial and, to our knowledge, no complete set of predicate argument structures derived from the Treebank exists. Our paper describes a method for retrieving predicate-argument structures that circumvents the complexity of the tree structures in the corpus, while employing few template rules. Our system operates on a flattened, morphologically enriched version of the corpus. This flattened representation allows access to all levels of the tree simultaneously and thus enables the detection of the main sentence constituents by means of simple template rules. A small number of rules apply to identify the head words of each constituent and the latter fill in the constituent templates, to build the logical forms representative of the predicate argument structure. The system is robust in the face of incomplete syntactic coverage."

This process has yielded a cleaner treebank that can potentially be used in any framework. We also show how unary type-changing rules for certain types of modifiers can be introduced in a CCG grammar to ensure a compact lexicon without augmenting the generative power of the system.

The formalism covers a wide variety of semantic phenomena(including scope and lexical ambiguities, anaphora and presupposition),is computationally attractive, and has a genuine inference component. Itcombines a well-established linguistic formalism (DRT) with advancedtechniques to deal with ambiguity (underspecification), and isinnovative in the use of first-order theorem proving techniques.The architecture of the formalism for natural language understandingthat I advocate consists of three levels of processing:underspecification, resolution, andinference. Each of these levels has a distinct function andtherefore employs a different kind of semantic representation. Themappings between these different representations define the interfacesbetween the levels.I show how underspecified semantic representations can be built in acompositional way (for a fragment of English Grammar) using standardtechniques borrowed from the \u03bb-calculus, how inferences can becarried out on discourse representations using a translation tofirst-order logic, and how existing research prototypes (discourseprocessing and spoken-dialogue systems) implement the formalism."

Log-linear models can easily encode the long-range dependencies inherent in coordination and extraction phenomena, which CCG was designed to handle. Log-linear models have previously been applied to statistical parsing, under the assumption that all possible parses for a sentence can be enumerated. Enumerating all parses is infeasible for large grammars; however, dynamic programming over a packed chart can be used to efficiently estimate the model parameters. We describe a parellelised implementation which runs on a Beowulf cluster and allows the complete WSJ Penn Treebank to be used for estimation."

The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples. Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models."

                "text": "This dissertation is concerned with the creation of training data and the development of probability models for statistical parsing of English with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). Parsing, or syntactic analysis, is a prerequisite for semantic interpretation, and forms therefore an integral part of any system which requires natural language understanding. Since almost all naturally occurring sentences are ambiguous, it is not sufficient (and often impossible) to generate all possible syntactic analyses. Instead, the parser needs to rank competing analyses and select only the most likely ones. A statistical parser uses a probability model to perform this task. I propose a number of ways in which such probability models can be defined for CCG. The kinds of models developed in this dissertation, generative models over normal-form derivation trees, are particularly simple, and have the further property of restricting the set of syntactic analyses to those corresponding to a canonical derivation structure. This is important to guarantee that parsing can be done efficiently. In order to achieve high parsing accuracy, a large corpus of annotated data is required to estimate the parameters of the probability models. Most existing wide-coverage statistical parsers use models of phrase-structure trees estimated from the Penn Treebank, a 1-million-word corpus of manually annotated sentences from the Wall Street Journal. This dissertation presents an algorithm which translates the phrase-structure analyses of the Penn Treebank to CCG derivations. The resulting corpus, CCGbank, is used to train and test the models proposed in this dissertation. Experimental results indicate that parsing accuracy (when evaluated according to a comparable metric, the recovery of unlabelled word-word dependency relations), is as high as that of standard Penn Treebank parsers which use similar modelling techniques. Most existing wide-coverage statistical parsers use simple phrase-structure grammars whose syntactic analyses fail to capture long-range dependencies, and therefore do not correspond to directly interpretable semantic representations. By contrast, CCG is a grammar formalism in which semantic representations that include long-range dependencies can be built directly during the derivation of syntactic structure. These dependencies define the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, and are used for two purposes in this dissertation: First, the performance of the parser can be evaluated according to how well it recovers these dependencies. In contrast to purely syntactic evaluations, this yields a direct measure of how accurate the semantic interpretations returned by the parser are. Second, I propose a generative model that captures the local and non-local dependencies in the predicate-argument structure, and investigate the impact of modelling non-local in addition to local dependencies."
