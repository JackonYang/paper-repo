In this paper we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/~szeliski/stereo."

                "text": "The fundamental task in the stereo problem is to reconstruct surfaces in a three dimensional scene from two or more images of the scene. Traditionally, a correspondence is established between regions in the images based on cross correlation of the intensity, but stereo correspondence of features such as edges has the important advantage of segmentation at surface discontinuities, which are typical of cultural objects. Edge-based stereo also permits measurement of scene dimensions to higher accuracy than area-based stereo. \nKnowledge of the camera model permits reduction of the problem to a one-dimensional search to match corresponding epipolar lines. We have derived two particularly strong geometric constraints, one relating the angles of corresponding edges and the other relating intervals between pairs of such edges. These constraints correspond to edge and surface orientation respectively. They are used as components of an evaulation function that ranks potential matches of an epipolar line pair. We demonstrate a dynamic programming algorithm that uses this function to search efficiently through all potential matches, returning those whose evaluation function scores within a specified range of the best. The search is subject to a set of consistency rules derived from assumptions of surface continuity and geometric conditions for occlusion. The rules guarantee that the matches considered are a physically realizable set of continuous surfaces. Local context and edge continuity provide constraints between adjacent epipolar lines and are used iteratively to produce global consistency in the final correspondences. \nWe describe a stereo system based on edge matching with the above constraints and search algorithm, intended for use with scenes containing man-made objects. The system assumes as input a pair of images together with derived extended edges, and produces a correspondence map from which are calculated the positions of the edges and surfaces in the scene. Results are demonstrated on several examples of real and artificial scenes."

In 1977 Marr and Poggio proposed one such computational model, which was characterized as matching certain feature points in difference-of-Gaussian filtered images and using the information obtained by matching coarser resolution representations to restrict the search space for matching finer resolution representations. An implementation of the algorithm and its testing on a range of images was reported in 1980. Since then a number of psychophysical experiments have suggested possible refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial photographs, have led to a number of modifications. In this paper, we present a version of the Marr-Poggio-Grimson algorithm that embodies these modifications, and we illustrate its performance on a series of natural images."

Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

Unfortunately, as more images are added, the prevalence of semi-occluded regions (pixels visible in some but not all images) also increases. We propose some novel techniques to deal with this problem. Our first idea is to use a combination of shiftable windows and a dynamically selected subset of the neighboring images to do the matches. Our second idea is to explicitly label occluded pixels within a global energy minimization framework, and to reason about visibility within this framework so that only truly visible pixels are matched. Experimental results show a dramatic improvement using the first idea over conventional multibaseline stereo, especially when used in conjunction with a global energy minimization technique. These results also show that explicit occlusion labeling and visibility reasoning do help, but not significantly, if the spatial and temporal selection is applied first."

This technique is developed for application to problems in robotics where noise tolerance, reliability, and speed are predominant issues. A high speed pipelined convolver for preprocessing images and an unstructured light technique for improving signal quality are introduced to help enhance performance to meet the demands of this task domain. These optimizations, however, are not sufficient. A closer examination of the problems encountered suggests that broader interpretations of both the objective of binocular stereo and of the zero-crossing theory of Marr and Poggio [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 204, 301 (1979)] are required. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the problem of making a single primitive surface measurement for example, to determine whether or not a specified volume of space is occupied, to measure the range to a surface at an indicated image location, or to determine the elevation gradient at that position. In this framework we make a subtle but important shift from the explicit use of zero-crossing contours (in bandpass-filtered images) as the elements matched between left and right images, to the use of the signs between zero crossings. With this change, we obtain a simpler algorithm with a reduced sensitivity to noise and a more predictable behavior. The practical real-time imaging stereo matcher (PRISM) system incorporates this algorithm with the unstructured light technique and a high speed digital convolver. It has been used successfully by others as a sensor in a path-planning system and a bin-picking system."

                "text": "A stereo algorithm is presented that optimizes a maximum likelihood cost function. The maximum likelihood cost function assumes that corresponding features in the left and right images are normally distributed about a common true value and consists of a weighted squared error term if two features are matched or a (fixed) cost if a feature is determined to be occluded. The stereo algorithm finds the set of correspondences that maximize the cost function subject to ordering and uniqueness constraints. The stereo algorithm is independent of the matching primitives. However, for the experiments described in this paper, matching is performed on the $cf4$individual pixel intensities.$cf3$ Contrary to popular belief, the pixel-based stereo appears to be robust for a variety of images. It also has the advantages of (i) providing adensedisparity map, (ii) requiringnofeature extraction, and (iii)avoidingthe adaptive windowing problem of area-based correlation methods. Because feature extraction and windowing are unnecessary, a very fast implementation is possible. Experimental results reveal that good stereo correspondences can be found using only ordering and uniqueness constraints, i.e., withoutlocalsmoothness constraints. However, it is shown that the original maximum likelihood stereo algorithm exhibits multiple global minima. The dynamic programming algorithm is guaranteed to find one, but not necessarily the same one for each epipolar scanline, causing erroneous correspondences which are visible as small local differences between neighboring scanlines. Traditionally, regularization, which modifies the original cost function, has been applied to the problem of multiple global minima. We developed several variants of the algorithm that avoid classical regularization while imposing several global cohesiveness constraints. We believe this is a novel approach that has the advantage of guaranteeing that solutions minimize the original cost function and preserve discontinuities. The constraints are based on minimizing the total number of horizontal and/or vertical discontinuities along and/or between adjacent epipolar lines, and local smoothing is avoided. Experiments reveal that minimizing the sum of the horizontal and vertical discontinuities provides the most accurate results. A high percentage of correct matches and very little smearing of depth discontinuities are obtained. An alternative to imposing cohesiveness constraints to reduce the correspondence ambiguities is to use more than two cameras. We therefore extend the two camera maximum likelihood toNcameras. TheN-camera stereo algorithm determines the \u201cbest\u201d set of correspondences between a given pair of cameras, referred to as the principal cameras. Knowledge of the relative positions of the cameras allows the 3D point hypothesized by an assumed correspondence of two features in the principal pair to be projected onto the image plane of the remainingN? 2 cameras. TheseN? 2 points are then used to verify proposed matches. Not only does the algorithm explicitly model occlusion between features of the principal pair, but the possibility of occlusions in theN? 2 additional views is also modeled. Previous work did not model this occlusion process, the benefits and importance of which are experimentally verified. Like other multiframe stereo algorithms, the computational and memory costs of this approach increase linearly with each additional view. Experimental results are shown for two outdoor scenes. It is clearly demonstrated that the number of correspondence errors is significantly reduced as the number of views/cameras is increased."

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

The selected window is optimal in the sense that it produces the disparity estimate having the least uncertainty after evaluating both the intensity and the disparity variations within a window. The algorithm employs a statistical model that represents uncertainty of disparity of points over the window; the uncertainty is assumed to increase with the distance of the point from the center point. The algorithm is completely local and does not include any global optimization. Also, the algorithm does not use any post-processing smoothing, but smooth surfaces are recovered as smooth while sharp disparity edges are retained. Experimental results have demonstrated a clear advantage of this algorithm over algorithms with a fixed-size window, for both synthetic and real images.<<ETX>>"

We intensively analyzed the occlusion in the camera matrix stereo (SEA) and developed a simple but effective method to detect the presence of occlusion and to eliminate its effect in the correspondence search. By considering several statistics on the occlusion and the accuracy in the SEA, we derived a few base masks which represent occlusion patterns and are effective for the detection of occlusion. Several experiments using typical indoor scenes showed quite good performance to obtain dense and accurate depth maps even at the occluding boundaries of objects."

To produce smooth and detailed disparity maps, two assumptions that were originally proposed by Marr and Poggio (1976, 1979) are adopted: uniqueness and continuity. That is, the disparity maps have a unique value per pixel and are continuous almost everywhere. These assumptions are enforced within a three-dimensional array of match values in disparity space. Each match value corresponds to a pixel in an image and a disparity relative to another image. An iterative algorithm updates the match values by diffusing support among neighboring values and inhibiting others along similar lines of sight. By applying the uniqueness assumption, occluded regions can be explicitly identified. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we present the processing results from synthetic and real image pairs, including ones with ground-truth values for quantitative comparison with other methods."

Motivated by applications such as novel view generation and motion-compensated compression, we suggest that the ability to predict new views or frames is a natural metric for evaluating such algorithms. Our new metric has several advantages over comparing algorithm outputs to true motions or depths. First of all, it does not require the knowledge of ground truth data, which may be difficult or laborious to obtain. Second, it more closely matches the ultimate requirements of the application, which are typically tolerant of errors in uniform color regions, but very sensitive to isolated pixel errors or disocclusion errors. In the paper we develop a number of error metrics based on this paradigm, including forward and inverse prediction errors, residual motion error and local motion-compensated prediction error. We show results on a number of widely used motion and stereo sequences, many of which do not have associated ground truth data."

                "text": "Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.\nOver the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space, and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem."

The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed."

In this paper we propose an algorithm to compute correspondence between stereo images or between frames of a motion sequence by minimizing an energy functional that accounts for slanted surfaces. The energy is minimized in a greedy strategy that alternates between segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping regions (using the multiway-cut algorithm of Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih) and finding the affine parameters describing the displacement function of each region. A follow-up step enables the algorithm to escape local minima due to oversegmentation. Experiments on real images show the algorithm's ability to find an accurate segmentation and displacement map, as well as discontinuities and creases, from a wide variety of stereo and motion imagery."

This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

                "text": "This thesis investigates the use of stereo vision for the application of view synthesis. View synthesis--the problem of creating images of a scene as it would appear from novel viewpoints--has traditionally been approached using methods from computer graphics. These methods, however, suffer from low rendering speed, limited achievable realism, and, most severely, their dependence on a global scene model, which typically needs to be constructed manually. \nIn this thesis, we present a new approach to view synthesis that avoids the above problems by synthesizing new views from existing images of a scene. Using an image-based representation of scene geometry computed by stereo vision methods, a global model can be avoided, and realistic new views can be synthesized quickly using image warping. \nThe new application of stereo for view synthesis makes it necessary to re-evaluate the requirements on stereo algorithms. We compare view synthesis to several traditional applications of stereo, and conclude that stereo vision is better suited for view synthesis than for applications requiring explicit 3D reconstruction. We also discuss ways of dealing with partially occluded regions of unknown depth and with completely occluded regions of unknown texture, and present experiments demonstrating that it is possible to efficiently synthesize realistic new views even from inaccurate and incomplete depth information. \nThis thesis also contributes several novel stereo algorithms that are motivated by the specific requirements imposed by view synthesis. We introduce a new evidence measure based on intensity gradients for establishing correspondences between images. This measure combines the notions of similarity and confidence, and allows stable matching and easy assigning of canonical depth interpretations in image regions of insufficient information. We also present new diffusion-based stereo algorithms that are motivated by the need to correctly recover object boundaries. In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian estimation technique that significantly outperforms area-based algorithms using fixed-sized windows. We provide experimental results for all algorithms on both synthetic and real images."

In addition, we make most of the camera view areas by converging them at a volume of interest.

This 3D world is acquired through stereo reconstruction at the remote site. In this paper we start a performance analysis of stereo algorithms with respect to the task of immersive visualization. As opposed to usual monocular image based rendering, we are also interested in the depth error in novel views because our rendering is stereoscopic. We describe an evaluation test-bed which provides a world-wide first available set of registered dense \"ground-truth\" laser data and image data from multiple views. We establish metrics for novel depth views that reflect discrepancies both in the image and in 3D-space. It is well known that stereo performance is affected by both erroneous matching as well as incorrect depth triangulation. We experimentally study the effects of occlusion and low texture on the distributions of the error metrics. Then, we algebraically predict the behavior of depth and novel projection error as a function of the camera set-up and the error in the disparity. These are first steps towards building a laboratory for psychophysical judgement of depth estimates which is the ultimate performance test of tele-presence stereo."

We develop a model for how brightness changes from one irnage to another in a stereo pair. A spatially-varying multiplier is used to relate image brightnesses, so that matching of dissimilx greyvalues can occur. The problem of stereo matching then depends upon solving for the multiplier and disparity fields. The so!ution is obtained by formulating an equivalent minimization problem, then solving the minimization problem using the variational calculus. We describe the implementation on a highly parallel computer, and present sample results."

Very few are formulated using the framework of energy functionals. A formulation that lies within such a framework and addresses the discontinuities and half-occlusions is presented. The formulation follows directly from the assumption that, when matching the left and right images, the order of points must be preserved. A model consisting of two coupled energy functions, corresponding to the two eyes, is presented. They are coupled in the sense that the discontinuity locus determined by one eye also determines the occluded area in the image seen by the other eye. A nonlinear system of diffusion equations is derived by simultaneously applying gradient descent to these functionals. The diffusion equations are implemented by a finite-difference scheme.<<ETX>>"

Given the signals and a window, there are two factors that determine the difficulty of obtaining precise matching. The first is the variation of the signal within the window, which must be large enough, relative to noise, that the SSD values exhibit a clear and sharp minimum at the correct disparity. The second factor is the variation of disparity within the window, which must be small enough that signals of corresponding positions are duly compared. These two factors present conflicting requirements to the size of the matching window, since a larger window tends to increase the signal variation, but at the same time tends to include points of different disparity. A window size must be adaptively selected depending on local variations of signal and disparity in order to compute a most-certain estimate of disparity at each point.There has been little work on a systematic method for automatic window-size selection. The major difficulty is that, while the signal variation is measurable from the input, the disparity variation is not, since disparities are what we wish to calculate. We introduce here a statistical model of disparity variation within a window, and employ it to establish a link between the window size and the uncertainty of the computed disparity. This allows us to choose the window size that minimizes uncertainty in the disparity computed at each point. This article presents a theory for the model and the resultant algorithm, together with analytical and experimental results that demonstrate their effectiveness."

Each layer consists of an explicit 3D plane equation, a colored image with per-pixel opacity (a sprite), and a per-pixel depth offset relative to the plane. Initial estimates of the layers are recovered using techniques taken from parametric motion estimation. These initial estimates are then refined using a re-synthesis algorithm which takes into account both occlusions and mixed pixels. Reasoning about such effects allows the recovery of depth and color information with high accuracy even in partially occluded regions. Another important benefit of our framework is that the output consists of a collection of approximately planar regions, a representation which is far more appropriate than a dense depth map for many applications such as rendering and video parsing."

A true multi-image technique must generalize to any number of images, be of linear algorithmic complexity in the number of images, and use all the images in an equal manner. A new space-sweep approach to true multi-image matching is presented that simultaneously determines 2D feature correspondences and the 3D positions of feature points in the scene.

We propose an algorithm which chooses an appropriate window shape by optimizing over a large class of \"compact\" windows. We call them compact because their ratio of perimeter to area tends to be small. We believe that this is the first window matching algorithm which can explicitly construct non-rectangular windows. Efficient optimization over the compact window class is achieved via the minimum ratio cycle algorithm. In practice it takes time linear in the size of the largest window in our class. Still the straightforward approach to find the optimal window for each pixel-disparity pair is too slow. We develop pruning heuristics which gave practically the same results while reducing running time from minutes to seconds. Our experiments show that unlike fixed window algorithms, our method avoids blurring disparity boundaries as well as constructs large windows in low textured areas. The algorithm has few parameters which are easy to choose, and the same parameters work well for different image pairs."

Sub-pixel estimation using parabola fitting over three points with their similarity measures is also a common method to increase the resolution of matching. However, few investigations or studies concerning the characteristics of this estimation have been reported. In this paper we have analyzed the sub-pixel estimation error by using an approximate image function and three kinds of similarity measures for matching. The results illustrate some inherently problematic phenomena such as so called \"pixel-locking\". In addition to this, we propose a new algorithm to greatly reduce sub-pixel estimation error. This method is independent from the similarity measure and quite simple to implement. The advantage of our novel method is confirmed through experiments using three different types of images."

We present a new registration algorithm based on a spline representation of the displacement field which can be specialized to solve all of the above mentioned problems. In particular, we show how to compute local flow, global (parametric) flow, rigid flow resulting from camera egomotion, and multiframe versions of the above problems. Using a spline-based description of the flow removes the need for overlapping correlation windows, and produces an explicit measure of the correlation between adjacent flow estimates. We demonstrate our algorithm on multiframe image registration and the recovery of 3D projective scene geometry. We also provide results on a number of standard motion sequences.<<ETX>>"

By studying the equivalence class of all 3D shapes that reproduce the input photographs, we prove the existence of a special member of this class, the photo hull, that (1) can be computed directly from photographs of the scene, and (2) subsumes all other members of this class. We then give a provably-correct algorithm, called Space Carving, for computing this shape and present experimental results on complex real-world scenes. The approach is designed to (1) capture photorealistic shapes that accurately model scene appearance from a wide range of viewpoints, and (2) account for the complex interactions between occlusion, parallax, shading, and their view-dependent effects on scene-appearance."

This assumption is central to much of computer vision. However, surprisingly little work has been performed to support this assumption, despite the fact the many of algorithms are very sensitive to deviations from CIB. An examination of the images contained in the SRI JISCT stereo database revealed that the constant image brightness assumption is indeed often false. Moreover, the simple additive/multiplicative models of the form I/sub L/=/spl beta/I/sub R/+/spl alpha/ do not adequately represent the observed deviations. A comprehensive physical model of the observed deviations is difficult to develop. However, many potential sources of deviations can be represented by a nonlinear monotonically increasing relationship between intensities. Under these conditions, we believe that an expansion/contraction matching of the intensity histograms represents the best method to both measure the degree of validity of the CIB assumption and correct for it. Dynamic histogram warping (DHW) is closely related to histogram specification. It is shown that histogram specification introduces artifacts that do not occur with dynamic histogram warping. Experimental results show that image histograms are closely matched after DHW, especially when both histograms are modified simultaneously. DHW is also capable of removing simple constant additive and multiplicative biases without derivative operations, thereby avoiding amplification of high frequency noise. DHW can improve the estimates from stereo and optical flow estimators."

We suggest that integration is best performed at the location of discontinuities in early processes, such as discontinuities in image brightness, depth, motion, texture, and color. Coupled Markov Random Field models can be used to combine vision modalities with their discontinuities. We derive a scheme to integrate intensity edges with stereo depth and motion field information and show results from a Connection Machine algorithm on synthetic and natural images. The use of intensity edges to integrate other visual cues and to help discover discontinuities emerges as a general and powerful principle."

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"

While rectangular windows are efficient, they yield poor results near object boundaries. We describe an efficient method for choosing an arbitrarily shaped connected window, in a manner that varies at each pixel. Our approach can be applied to several problems, including image restoration and visual correspondence. It runs in linear time, and takes a few seconds on traditional benchmark images. Performance on both synthetic and real imagery appears promising."

It is based upon the definition of a variational principle that must be satisfied by the surfaces of the objects in the scene and their images. The Euler-Lagrange equations which are deduced from the variational principle provide a set of PDE's which are used to deform an initial set of surfaces which then move towards the objects to be detected. The level set implementation of these PDE's potentially provides an efficient and robust way of achieving the surface evolution and to deal automatically with changes in the surface topology during the deformation, i.e. to deal with multiple objects. Results of a two dimensional implementation of our theory are presented on synthetic and real images."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene, fully consistent with the input images. The approach is evaluated with images from both inward-facing and outward-facing cameras."

Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data."

They also show the relationship between the robust estimation framework and line-process approaches for coping with spatial discontinuities. In doing so, the notion of a line process is generalized to that of an outlier process that can account for violations in both the brightness and smoothness assumptions. A graduated non-convexity algorithm is presented for recovering optical flow and motion discontinuities. The performance of the robust formulation is demonstrated on both synthetic data and natural images.<<ETX>>"

The authors formulate deformable superquadrics which incorporate the global shape parameters of a conventional superellipsoid with the local degrees of freedom of a spline. The local/global representational power of a deformable superquadric simultaneously satisfies the conflicting requirements of shape reconstruction and shape recognition. The model's six global deformational degrees of freedom capture gross shape features from visual data and provide salient part descriptors for efficient indexing into a database of stored models. Model fitting experiments involving 2D monocular image data and 3D range data are reported.<<ETX>>"
