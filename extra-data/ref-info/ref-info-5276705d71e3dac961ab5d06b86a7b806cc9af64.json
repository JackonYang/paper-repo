We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

We represent prior knowledge of 3D shapes and scenes by probabilistic models at two levels - both are defined on graphs. The first level model is built on a graph representation for single objects, and it is a mixture model for both man-made block objects such as trees and grasses. It assumes surface and boundary smoothness, 3D angle symmetry etc. The second level model is built on the relation graph of all objects in a scene. It assumes that objects should be supported for maximum stability with global bounding surfaces, such as ground, sky and walls. Given an input image, we extract the geometry and photometric structures through image segmentation and sketching, and represent them in a big graph. Then we partition the graph into subgraphs each being an object, infer the 3D shape and recover occluded surfaces, edges and vertices in each subgraph, and infer the scene structures between the recovered 3D sub-graphs. The inference algorithm samples from the prior model under the constraint that it reproduces the observed image/sketch under projective geometry."

Object categories are modeled via distributions over the 3D location and appearance of visual features. Uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a particular image is then achieved via a transformed Dirichlet process. In contrast with image-based approaches to object recognition, we model scale variations as the perspective projection of objects in different 3D poses. To calibrate the underlying geometry, we incorporate binocular stereo images into the training process. A robust likelihood model accounts for outliers in matched stereo features, allowing effective learning of 3D object structure from partial 2D segmentations. Applied to a dataset of office scenes, our model detects objects at multiple scales via a coarse reconstruction of the corresponding 3D geometry."

The model is made up of several texture-mapped planar billboards and has the complexity of a typical children's pop-up book illustration. Our main insight is that instead of attempting to recover precise geometry, we statistically model geometric classes defined by their orientations in the scene. Our algorithm labels regions of the input image into coarse categories: \"ground\", \"sky\", and \"vertical\". These labels are then used to \"cut and fold\" the image into a pop-up model using a set of simple assumptions. Because of the inherent ambiguity of the problem and the statistical nature of the approach, the algorithm is not expected to work on every image. However. it performs surprisingly well for a wide range of scenes taken from a typical person's photo album."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception. The main conclusion is that it is possible to separate a picture or scene into the constituent objects exclusively on the basis of monocular geometric properties (on the basis of pure form); in fact, successful methods are shown."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

The interpretation of shading, edges, and junctions may provide a 3D model of the scene but it will not provide information about the actual \"scale\" of the space. One possible source of information for absolute depth estimation is the image size of known objects. However, object recognition, under unconstrained conditions, remains difficult and unreliable for current computational approaches. We propose a source of information for absolute depth estimation based on the whole scene structure that does not rely on specific objects. We demonstrate that, by recognizing the properties of the structures present in the image, we can infer the scale of the scene and, therefore, its absolute mean depth. We illustrate the interest in computing the mean depth of the scene with application to scene recognition and object detection."

Focusing on the problem of autonomous 3d reconstruction of indoor scenes, in this paper we present a dynamic Bayesian network model capable of resolving some of these ambiguities and recovering 3d information for many images. Our model assumes a \"floorwall\" geometry on the scene and is trained to recognize the floor-wall boundary in each column of the image. When the image is produced under perspective geometry, we show that this model can be used for 3d reconstruction from a single image. To our knowledge, this was the first monocular approach to automatically recover 3d reconstructions from single indoor images."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps."

This minimal information is typically the vanishing line of a reference plane, and a vanishing point for a direction not parallel to the plane. It is shown that affine scene structure may then be determined from the image, without knowledge of the camera's internal calibration (e.g. focal length), nor of the explicit relation between camera and world (pose).In particular, we show how to (i) compute the distance between planes parallel to the reference plane (up to a common scale factor); (ii) compute area and length ratios on any plane parallel to the reference plane; (iii) determine the camera's location. Simple geometric derivations are given for these results. We also develop an algebraic representation which unifies the three types of measurement and, amongst other advantages, permits a first order error propagation analysis to be performed, associating an uncertainty with each measurement.We demonstrate the technique for a variety of applications, including height measurements in forensic images and 3D graphical modelling from single images."

In this framework, the second view is first predicted from the reference view using the depth information. A global match measure is then defined as the similarity function between the predicted image and the actual image. Stereo computation is converted into a search problem where the goal is to find the depth map that maximizes the global match measure. The major advantage of this framework is that the global visibility constraint is inherently enforced in the computation. This paper explores several key components of this framework including (1) three color segmentation based depth representations, (2) an incremental warping algorithm that dramatically reduces the computational complexity, and (3) scene constraints such as the smoothness constraint and the color similarity constraint. Experimental results using different types of depth representations are presented. The quality of the computed depth maps is demonstrated through image-based rendering from new viewpoints."

The mobility sensors (LADAR, stereo, etc.) on these robotic vehicles can however populate these maps only up to a distance of a few tens of meters. A navigation system has no knowledge about the world beyond this sensing horizon. As a result, path planners that rely only on this knowledge are unable to anticipate obstacles sufficiently early and have no choice but to resort to an inefficient local obstacle avoidance behavior. However, recent developments in the computer vision community allows us to collect geometric information about the environment far beyond this sensing horizon. The coarse 3D geometric estimation that can be recovered is derived from an appearance-based model. That uses a multiple-hypothesis framework to robustly estimate scene structure from a single image and estimating confidences for each geometric label. This 3D geometric estimation is used with a previously presented navigation strategy that reasons about sensor constraints and plans for measurements while navigating towards the goal. The validity of the sensing method and navigation strategy is supported by results from simulations as well as field experiments with a real robotic platform. These results also show that significant reduction in path length can be achieved by using this framework"

The main premise of the approach is the fact that in man-made environments, the majority of lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We exploit this observation towards efficient detection and estimation of vanishing points, which provide strong constraints on camera parameters and relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene.By combining efficient image processing techniques in the line detection and initialization stage we demonstrate that simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions can be achieved in the absence of internal parameters of the camera. Constraints between vanishing points are then used for partial calibration and relative rotation estimation. The algorithm has been tested in a variety of indoors and outdoors scenes and its efficiency and automation makes it amenable for implementation on robotic platforms."

It is argued that linear approaches have the shortcoming that they require a priori models of region shape. The proposed transform avoids this by letting the structure emerge, bottom-up, from interactions among pixels. The transform involves global computations on pairs of pixels followed by vector integration of the results. An attraction force field is computed over the image in which pixels belonging to the same region are mutually attracted and the region is characterized by a convergent flow. It is shown that the transform possesses properties that allow multiscale segmentation, or extraction of original, unblurred structure at all different geometric and photometric scales present. This is in contrast with much previous work wherein multiscale structure is viewed as the smoothed structure in a multiscale signal decimation. Scale is an integral parameter of the force computation, and the number and values of scale parameters associated with the image can be estimated automatically. Regions are detected at all a priori unknown scales resulting in automatic construction of a segmentation tree, in which each pixel is annotated with descriptions of all the regions it belongs to. Transform properties are presented for piecewise-constant images but hold for more general ones. Thus the proposed method is intended as a solution to the problem of multiscale, integrated edge and region detection, or low-level image segmentation. Experimental results are given."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

To achieve this we combine two ideas: (i) that a set of segmented objects can be partitioned into visual object classes using topic discovery models from statistical text analysis; and (ii) that visual object classes can be used to assess the accuracy of a segmentation. To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations. We demonstrate that such an algorithm succeeds in automatically discovering many familiar objects in a variety of image datasets, including those from Caltech, MSRC and LabelMe."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes.

Material detection refers to the problem of identifying key semantic material types (such as sky, grass, foliage, water, and snow in images). In this paper, we present a holistic approach to determining scene content, based on a set of individual material detection algorithms, as well as probabilistic spatial context models. A major limitation of individual material detectors is the significant number of misclassifications that occur because of the similarities in color and texture characteristics of various material types. We have developed a spatial context-aware material detection system that reduces misclassification by constraining the beliefs to conform to the probabilistic spatial context models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of materials detection is improved by 13% using the spatial context models over the individual material detectors themselves."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

In this work we build upon stability-based approaches to develop a new method for automatic model order selection and cue combination with applications to visual grouping. Novel features of our approach include the ability to detect multiple stable clusterings (instead of only one), a simpler means of calculating stability that does not require training a classifier, and a new characterization of the space of stabilities for a continuum of segmentations that provides for an efficient sampling scheme. Our contribution is a framework for visual grouping that frees the user from the hassles of parameter tuning and model order selection: the input is an image, the output is a shortlist of segmentations."

Both measurements were subject to internal consistency checks. We found that both measurements were consistent with a relief (continuous pictorial surface) interpretation within the session-to-session scatter. We reconstructed the pictorial relief from both measurements separately, and found results that differed in detail but were quite similar in their basic structures. Formally, one expects certain geometrical identities that relate range and attitude data. Because we have independent measurements of both, we can attempt an empirical verification of such geometrical identities. Moreover, we can check whether the statistical scatter in the data indicates that, for example, the surface attitudes are derivable from a depth map or vice versa. We estimate that pairwise depth comparisons are an order of magnitude less precise than might be expected from the attitude data. Thus, the surface attitudes cannot be derived from a depth map as operationally defined by our methods, although the reverse is a possibility."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

We first conduct a theoretical study of the descriptive Markov random field model and the generative wavelet/sparse coding model from the perspective of entropy and complexity. The competition between the two types of models defines the concept of \"sketchability\", which divides image into texture and geometry. We then propose a primal sketch model that integrates the two models and, in addition, a Gestalt field model for spatial organization. We also propose a sketching pursuit process that coordinates the competition between two pursuit algorithms: the matching pursuit (Mallat and Zhang, 1993) and the filter pursuit (Zhu, et al., 1997), that seek to explain the image by bases and filters respectively. The model can be used to learn a dictionary of image primitives, or textons in Julesz's language, for natural images. The primal sketch model is not only parsimonious for image representation, but produces meaningful sketches over a large number of generic images."

The notion of completely empty space is asserted to be irrelevant for the theory of space-perception. The perception of space between objects, in this theory, depends on the experience of contours against a general background, and on the impression of one surface behind another. The fundamental 'sensations' of space are assumed to be the impressions of surface and edge. If the theory is valid, there should be discoverable variables in stimulation for the essential properties or qualities of a surface, and these should prove to be the effective stimuli for space-perception. What is called for is a listing of the properties or qualities-a phenomenological study-and a search for the corresponding stimulus variables-a program of psychophysical experiments."

We choose one class of primitives - 3D planar rectangles projected on images and six graph grammar production rules. Each production rule not only expands a node into its components, but also includes a number of equations that constrain the attributes of a parent node and those of its children. Thus our graph grammar is context sensitive. The grammar rules are used recursively to produce a large number of objects and patterns in images and thus the whole graph grammar is a type of generative model. The inference algorithm integrates bottom-up rectangle detection which activates top-down prediction using the grammar rules. The final results are validated in a Bayesian framework. The output of the inference is a hierarchical parsing graph with objects, surfaces, rectangles, and their spatial relations. In the inference, the acceptance of a grammar rule means recognition of an object, and actions are taken to pass the attributes between a node and its parent through the constraint equations associated with this production rule. When an attribute is passed from a child node to a parent node, it is called bottom-up, and the opposite is called top-down"

For such problems, the Gibbs sampler provides a general solution but is very slow, while other methods, such as Ncut and graph cuts are computationally effective but only work for specific energy forms and are not generally applicable. In this paper, we present a new inference algorithm that generalizes the Swendsen-Wang method to arbitrary probabilities defined on graph partitions. We begin by computing graph edge weights, based on local image features. Then, the algorithm iterates two steps: (1) graph clustering - it forms connected components by cutting the edges probabilistically based on their weights; (2) graph relabeling - it selects one connected component and flips probabilistically, the coloring of all vertices in the component simultaneously. Thus, it realizes the split, merge, and regrouping of a \"chunk\" of the graph, in contrast to Gibbs sampler that flips a single vertex. We prove that this algorithm simulates ergodic and reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph partitions and is applicable to arbitrary posterior probabilities or energy functions defined on graphs. We demonstrate the algorithm on two typical problems in computer vision-image segmentation and stereo vision. Experimentally, we show that it is 100-400 times faster in CPU time than the classical Gibbs sampler and 20-40 times faster then the DDMCMC segmentation algorithm. For stereo, we compare performance with graph cuts and belief propagation. We also show that our algorithm can automatically infer generative models and obtain satisfactory results (better than the graphic cuts or belief propagation) in the same amount of time."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

To demonstrate the power of the classification model, a simple algorithm is used to randomly search for good segmentations. Results are shown on a wide range of images."

Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images."

Lazy Snapping separates coarse and fine scale processing, making object specification and detailed adjustment easy. Moreover, Lazy Snapping provides instant visual feedback, snapping the cutout contour to the true object boundary efficiently despite the presence of ambiguous or low contrast edges. Instant feedback is made possible by a novel image segmentation algorithm which combines graph cut with pre-computed over-segmentation. A set of intuitive user interface (UI) tools is designed and implemented to provide flexible control and editing for the users. Usability studies indicate that Lazy Snapping provides a better user experience and produces better segmentation results than the state-of-the-art interactive image cutout tool, Magnetic Lasso in Adobe Photoshop."

A neural-network classifier is used to identify objects in images from a head mounted camera so that scene content specifically important for mobility may be made more visible. Enhanced images are displayed to the user on a head mounted display using a high saturation colour scheme where each type of object has a different colour, resulting in images which are highly visible and easy to interpret. The object classifier achieves a level of accuracy over 90%. Results from a pilot study conducted using people with a range of visual impairments are presented in which performance on a difficult mobility-related task was improved by over 100% using the system."

                "text": "This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian, statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in three aspects. Firstly, it designs effective and well balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the solution space and makes the split and merge process reversible at a middle level vision formulation. Thus it achieves globally optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Secondly, instead of computing a single maximum a posteriori solution, it proposes a mathematical principle for computing multiple distinct solutions to incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. A k-adventurers algorithm is proposed for extracting distinct multiple solutions from the Markov chain sequence. Thirdly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which effectively drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to traditional jump-diffusion method. Thus DDM-CMC paradigm provides a unifying framework where the role of existing segmentation algorithms, such as; edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, SNAKEs, region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. We report some results on color and grey level image segmentation in this paper and refer to a detailed report and a web site for extensive discussion."

A veritable flood of neurology texts continues to appear and one has difficulty in distinguishing one from another. This soft covered book on neurology by Dr. Mumenthaler is, however, a welcome exception to the usual dreary lot. It is easily carried in a pocket and so can be consulted when needed. The first part has a most excellent review of clinical methods and of the localizing value of abnormal neurological signs. Superb diagrams, tables, and line drawings of common neurological abnormalities encountered at the bedside make this section unique among pocket-sized neurology texts. The diagrams of normal and pathological roentgenographic and electromyographic findings, and of other special tests, are far superior to the often encountered unintelligible photographs. In the second part, neurologic diseases are adequately described, and judiciously selected references are given for those who might want further information, but this should not be necessary for undergraduates. The understanding of neurological disease is again facilitated by drawings and tables, some of which should be of use"

The striking similarity of the two problems in this framework allows us to design and analyze algorithms for both simultaneously, and to easily adapt algorithms designed for one problem to the other. For both problems, we give new algorithms and explain their potential advantages over existing methods. These algorithms are iterative and can be divided into two types based on whether the parameters are updated sequentially (one at a time) or in parallel (all at once). We also describe a parameterized family of algorithms that includes both a sequential- and a parallel-update algorithm as special cases, thus showing how the sequential and parallel approaches can themselves be unified. For all of the algorithms, we give convergence proofs using a general formalization of the auxiliary-function proof technique. As one of our sequential-update algorithms is equivalent to AdaBoost, this provides the first general proof of convergence for AdaBoost. We show that all of our algorithms generalize easily to the multiclass case, and we contrast the new algorithms with the iterative scaling algorithm. We conclude with a few experimental results with synthetic data that highlight the behavior of the old and newly proposed algorithms in different settings."

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications."

We give a simplified analysis of AdaBoost in this setting, and we show how this analysis can be used to find improved parameter settings as well as a refined criterion for training weak hypotheses. We give a specific method for assigning confidences to the predictions of decision trees, a method closely related to one used by Quinlan. This method also suggests a technique for growing decision trees which turns out to be identical to one proposed by Kearns and Mansour. We focus next on how to apply the new boosting algorithms to multiclass classification problems, particularly to the multi-label case in which each example may belong to more than one class. We give two boosting methods for this problem, plus a third method based on output coding. One of these leads to a new method for handling the single-label case which is simpler but as effective as techniques suggested by Freund and Schapire. Finally, we give some experimental results comparing a few of the algorithms discussed in this paper."

By computing statistics of straight lines (P1\u2013P2) and their intersections (P3\u2013P7) in the image, our system gains information about the vanishing points of a surface without explicitly computing them. Our system finds long, straight edges in the image using the method of Kosecka and Zhang (2002). The intersections of nearly parallel lines (within \u03c0/8 radians) are radially binned, according to the direction to the intersection point from the image center (8 orientations) and the distance from the image center (thresholds of 1.0 and 3.5 times the image size). We also found that computing a more explicit estimate of the vanishing points can help in some cases. We compute these vanishing points over the entire image (without regard to any segmentation), using the EM approach described by Kosecka and Zhang (2002). From this, we have a set of estimated vanishing points and the probability that each line in the image belongs to each vanishing point."
