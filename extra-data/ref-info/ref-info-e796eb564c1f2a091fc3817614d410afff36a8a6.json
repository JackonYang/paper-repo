We therefore propose a new generic document recognition method, called DMOS (Description and MOdification of Segmentation), that is made up of a new grammatical formalism, called EPF (Enhanced Position Formalism) and an associated parser which is able to introduce context in segmentation. We implement this method to obtain a generator of document recognition systems. This generator can automatically produce new recognition systems. It is only necessary to describe the document with an EPF grammar, which is then simply compiled. In this way, we have developed various recognition systems: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures. We have also defined a specific application to damaged military forms of the 19th Century. We have been able to test the generated system on 5,000 of these military forms. This has permitted us to validate the DMOS method on a real-world application."

Musical notation is governed by a substantial set of rules, but current systems fail to use them adequately. In complex scores, existing systems cannot overcome the well-known segmentation problems of document analysis, due mainly to the high density of music information. This paper proposes a new method of recognition which uses a grammar in order to formalize the syntactic rules and represent the context. However, where objects touch, there is a discrepancy between the way the existing knowledge (grammar) will describe an object and the way it is recognized, since touching objects have to be segmented first. Following a description of the grammar, this paper shall go on to propose the use of an operator to modify the way the grammar parses the image so that the system can deal with certain touching objects (e.g. where an accidental touches a notehead)."

Although Y. Nakano et al. (1986) looked upon the recognition of multi-kinds of table-form documents as an important subject from a practical point of view, they could not report any successful approach because their knowledge was based only on the physical coordinate data. In the approach presented, this recognition issue was solved, using both the classification tree based on the physical characteristics and the structure description tree based on the logical characteristics. At least, it is not so difficult to classify various kinds of documents into appropriate document classes since table-form documents are well designed on the basis of vertical and horizontal line segments. However, it is not easy in the case of the other documents because the geometric and spatial characteristics of documents are not well specified. It is necessary to investigate the application techniques for the other documents from the viewpoint of the knowledge representation.<<ETX>>"

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."

A recursive splitting and merging algorithm eliminates overlapping segments, filters false segments, and groups the segments into lines. Based on the extracted lines, an algorithm for rectangle extraction is proposed. We define the constraints between rectangles and edges. In a process of scanning the horizontal and vertical lines, candidate edges are validated and rectangles are generated if its surrounding edges and their combination are all valid. The process is recursively applied. It can tolerate large breaks in form lines, ignore irrelevant segments and deal with embedded rectangles. Experiments on a collection of forms show that our approach works well on poor quality images."
