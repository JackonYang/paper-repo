To understand tables, we rely on acquired expertise, background information, and practice. Current computerized tools seldom consider the structure and content in the context of other tables with related information. This paper addresses the table processing issue by developing a new framework to table understanding that applies an ontology-based conceptual modeling extraction approach to: (i) understand a table's structure and conceptual content to the extent possible; (ii) discover the constraints that hold between concepts extracted from the table; (iii) match the recognized concepts with ones from a more general specification of related concepts; and (iv) merge the resulting structure with other similar knowledge representations for use in future situations. The result is a formalized method of processing the format and content of tables while incrementally building a relevant reusable conceptual ontology."

In practice, encoding the layout of each information source is impossible. This work presents a novel semantic search approach capable of extracting information from general tables. Semantic ontology allows our agents to read tables in the same knowledge domain with different layouts. In addition, a system of layout syntax and a set of transformation rules are defined to transform tables into databases without losing their semantic meanings."

                "text": "In this paper, we consider the table understanding task and present a catalogue of particular issues that arise when the tables are those found on the web. In addition, we consider what happens when processes commonly associated with web pages are applied to those bearing tables. 1 Table Understanding and the Web The ubiquity of tables, and their ability to describe relational information in a compact and immediate manner make them attractive targets for automated understanding. Recent research into the automatic location, recognition and understanding of tables has demonstrated the viability of integrating automated table processing systems into larger knowledge management applications ([8]). However, table understanding is still a relatively novel research area, one whose definition and terminology are still not fixed. It is useful to break the task down into some subtasks, and to consider them in turn with respect to the understanding of tables delivered on the web. Generally, table processing can be conceptualized as consisting of table location; table recognition; functional and structural analysis; and finally interpretation the extraction of meaningful and unambiguously structured information ([4]). We concentrate on the first two tasks in the following. location table location is the processes of spotting tables in documents. Traditionally, this task comes in two basic forms document image sourced tables ([7], [3]) and electronic text sourced tables including HTML ([1]). The problem is extended to include the spotting of tables in other document encodings such as postscript, pdf, rtf, word, etc. In general, when considering tables on the web, the appropriate HTML tags are exploited (TABLE, TH, TD, etc.). However, this is where we come to the first two distinguishing points. the presence of the TABLE tag in an HTML document does not necessarily indicate the presence of a table ([1] suggest less than 30 % of HTML TABLEs are real tables in one particular domain). there are many other ways in which tables may be presented in web delivered documents plain text (PRE), images, mixtures of table specific tags (TABLE, etc.) and tags used within the table for their functionality in terms of placing text spatially (PRE, LI, etc.) see Figure 1 for an example of such complexities. The first point requires the creation of accurate classification technology. Given any TABLE node in the HTML, the classifier must accept or reject it. Such a classifier may be built either via hand crafted rules ([1]) or using a machine learning approach. Experiments suggest that a machine learning approach using a naive bayse classifier ([9]) based on a feature set describing the set of tags below the potential TABLE node in the document tree produces adequate results. Locating tables encoded in other formats requires technology from other areas. For example, images of tables may be processed by techniques from the document image field ([2]), pre-formatted tables (using the PRE) tag may be processed using plain text table methods ([5]). However, the classification problem extends to these cases and individual classifiers must be constructed to make decisions about document elements of each type. The remaining outstanding issues relate to the mixture of encoding types (e.g. tables built out of TABLE nodes and pre-formatted elements), as well as the mixture of encoding purposes (e.g. the use of the HTML TABLE to encode surrounding text as well as an embedded table). Figure 1. A web page using a mixture of HTML tables (on the left) and images of tables (on the right). recognition table recognition is the task of segmenting the original description of the table into a relative spatial description. In general this task is required when the input is low-level, such as a document image or an electronic text. Clearly, if such tables are found on a web page, the same process is required. Again, given certain assumptions, we can take the marked up tables in a web page to be the logical spatial table. However, there are certain issues that need to be understood in order to account for certain variations: internal cell structure though tags like TH and TD may be assumed to delimit a single cell in the table, there are cases where other non-table tags are used to provide internal structure in such a way as to associate the cell\u2019s contents with those of other cells. A solution would be required to apply a certain amount of recursive processing working into the structure and building a unified abstract table. split cells in order to gain more control over the distribution of the text in a cell, authors occasionally split the text and place it in two or more adjacent cells. This problem may be accommodated by exploiting linguistic process as described in [6] where the content of the cell can be used to indicate continuity, if any, to other cells. errors spanning errors occur when the COLSPAN or ROWSPAN values are not correctly calculated. There are two cases. In the first the cell spans beyond the border of the intended table giving the cell incorrect coordinates. In the second, the span of the cell does not communicate the correct meaning of the cell. For example, a cell that is intended to span three cells below it spans only one leading to ambiguity. The first type of problem may be repaired by some form of normalization, whereas the second requires intelligent processing in order to distinguish the following two cases:"

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

Neither merging the information from different data sources nor preparing it for the end user's access has been completely solved. The goal of this paper is to present a holistic approach to integration by using ontologies and logic. There are several reasons for an ontology-based approach: Ontologies are able to cover all occurring data structures, for ontologies can be seen as nowadays most advanced knowledge representation model. They are able to cover complexity, for the combination with deductive logic extends the mapping and business logic capabilities. As the model is separated from the data storage, we get a higher degree of abstraction, whereby the semantics of the whole system is increased. Ontologies are extendible and highly reusable and deliver the user a better access to his relevant content. \n \nIn this paper we describe how current capabilities of knowledge representation, mapping of structures and description of the business logic are extended. In an elaborated case study of a specific R&D process in the automobile industry [Ste03] we demonstrate that the complex integration process can be realized much easier, faster, more understandable and less expensive than before, without changing the existing IT legacy environment."

In a sense, F-logic stands in the same relationship to the object-oriented paradigm as classical predicate calculus stands to relational programming. F-logic has a model-theoretic semantics and a sound and complete resolution-based proof theory. A small number of fundamental concepts that come from object-oriented programming have direct representation in F-logic; other, secondary aspects of this paradigm are easily modeled as well. The paper also discusses semantic issues pertaining to programming with a deductive object-oriented language based on a subset of F-logic."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

It is common to view a deductive database as a general logic program consisting of rules (IDB) slttmg above elementary relations (EDB, facts). It is desirable to associate one Herbrand model with a program and think of that model as the \"meaning of the program, \" or Its \"declarative semantics. \" Ideally, queries directed to the program would be answered in accordance with this model. Recent research indicates that some programs do not have a \"satisfactory\" total model; for such programs, the question of an appropriate partial model arises. Unfounded sets and well-founded partial models are introduced and the well-founded semantics of a program are defined to be its well-founded partial model. If the well-founded partial model is m fact a total model. it is called the well-founded model. It n shown that the class of programs possessing a total well-founded model properly includes previously studied classes of \"stratified\" and \"locally stratified\" programs, The method in this paper is also compared with other proposals in the literature, including Clark's \"program completion, \" Fitting's and Kunen's 3-vahred interpretations of it, and the \"stable models\" of Gelfond and Lifschitz."

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

In this paper, we consider the problem of table detection in web documents. Its potential applications include web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved."

We conducted experiments with this method on a set of tables collected from 157 university web sites, and obtained the information extraction performance of 91.4% in the Fl-measure, showing the effectiveness of the combined use of structural table parsing and example-based label learning."

Question answering systems aim to improve search performance by providing users with specific answers, rather than having users scan retrieved documents for these answers. Our goal is to answer factual questions by exploiting the structure inherent in documents found on the World Wide Web (WWW). Based on this structure, documents are indexed into smaller units and associated with metadata. Transforming table cells into smaller units associated with metadata is an important part of this task. In addition, we report on work to improve question classification using language models. The domain used to develop this system is documents retrieved from a crawl of www.fedstats.gov."

Examples of such different representations include DOM-level and token-level representations, as well as two-dimensional geometric views of the rendered page (for tabular data) and representations of the visual appearance of text asm it will be rendered. Additionally, the learning system is modular, and can be easily adapted to new domains and tasks. The learning system described is part of an \"industrial-strength\" wrapper management system that is in active use at WhizBang Labs. Controlled experiments show that the learner has broader coverage and a faster learning rate than earlier wrapper-learning systems."

While most of the previous research has focused on quick and efficient generation of wrappers, the development of tools for wrapper maintenance has received less attention. This is an important research problem because Web sources often change in ways that prevent the wrappers from extracting data correctly. We present an efficient algorithm that learns structural information about data from positive examples alone. We describe how this information can be used for two wrapper maintenance applications: wrapper verification and reinduction. The wrapper verification system detects when a wrapper is not extracting correct data, usually because the Web source has changed its format. The reinduction algorithm automatically recovers from changes in the Web source by identifying data on Web pages so that a new wrapper may be generated for this source. To validate our approach, we monitored 27 wrappers over a period of a year. The verification algorithm correctly discovered 35 of the 37 wrapper changes, and made 16 mistakes, resulting in precision of 0.73 and recall of 0.95. We validated the reinduction algorithm on ten Web sources. We were able to successfully reinduce the wrappers, obtaining precision and recall values of 0.90 and 0.80 on the data extraction task."

This study focuses on three areas. First, we examined the query construction, providing data on the number of terms in queries, the use o f Boolean logic, use of term modifiers, and the modifications to queries by users. Second, we examine the search terms, including the most commonly used search terms and the rank/frequency distribution of search terms. Finally, in order to get an indicatio n of the level of user satisfaction with the search engine performance and searching technique, we supplement the quantitative analysis with the results of a survey of Excite users. This indication of performance is one of the components of sufficiency, a metric that measures how well a search engine satisfies a user's information desire. Implications of the findings for Web interface design are discussed."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

Examples are: use menus, no more than seven choices, maintain a consistent format, develop error responses that do not provoke anxiety [ZO] Research findings are used to support and guide the development of these and the many othrr existing prrrrpts. Although it may not be immediately apparent, such precepts arise from one basic all-encompassing guideline: An interface which is as attractive and useful as possible is modeled so that it flows in parallel with the cognitive expectations (conxious and unconscious) of the target users. The aurhors label the design of systems so they proceed and interact with the user in a manner parallel to the flow of the user's own thol$lt processes \" Cognitive I\\latch Interfaw Design \" (COMIND 151). The goal is to make the interface an extension of the user so its use requires (like a hand or an eye) no conscious attention. The user is empowered to focus his/her entire concentration on the problem at hand. Pieceby-piece investigators and designers accumulate, by means of research rxperimena, human/computer interface findings, and use these findings to build interfaces of &rr increasing user friendliness. It is expected that the culmination of these advances will be the creation of computer systems that can tailor themselves to a user's specific ps~chological/expertis~ profile. The experiment described in this article was performed within the framprvork described earlier. Although large ~luns are spent by industy for the purchase of tabular and graphic display packages, and although important decisions are regularly made based on data organized by mrans of such packages, little uncontested knowledge is availahlr concerning the relative rffcacy of tables and the various lorms of graphs. A consensus is that the literature iy in disarray."

In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations, and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies both the decisions made by a table recognizer and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

We added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published method (Sivaramakrishnan et al., 1995). We assumed different independence relationships in two zone sets. We used an optimized binary decision tree to estimate the maximum zone content class probability in one set while using the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal solution for a zone sequence in the other set. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1,600 images drawn from the UWCDROM III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 - 18pt and font size 19 - 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. Compared with our previous work (Wang et al., 2000), it raised the accuracy rate to 98.52% from 97.53% and reduced the mean false alarm rate to 0.53% from 1.26%."
