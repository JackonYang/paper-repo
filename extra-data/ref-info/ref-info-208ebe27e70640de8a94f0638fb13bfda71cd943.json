The theory of harmonic maps studies the mapping between different metric manifolds from the energy-minimization point of view. With the application of harmonic maps, a surface representation called harmonic shape images is generated to represent and match 3D freeform surfaces. The basic idea of harmonic shape images is to map a 3D surface patch with disc topology to a 2D domain and encode the shape information of the surface patch into the 2D image. This simplifies the surface-matching problem to a 2D image-matching problem. Due to the application of harmonic maps in generating harmonic shape images, harmonic shape images have the following advantages: they have sound mathematical background; they preserve both the shape and continuity of the underlying surfaces; and they are robust to occlusion and independent of any specific surface sampling scheme. The performance of surface matching using harmonic maps is evaluated using real data. Preliminary results are presented in the paper."

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. >"

With the advent of laser scanning systems, meshes of extreme complexity are rapidly becoming commonplace. Such meshes are notoriously expensive to store, transmit, render, and are awkward to edit. Multiresolution analysis offers a simple, unified, and theoretically sound approach to dealing with these problems. Lounsbery et al. have recently developed a technique for creating multiresolution representations for a restricted class of meshes with subdivision connectivity. Unfortunately, meshes encountered in practice typically do not meet this requirement. In this paper we present a method for overcoming the subdivision connectivity restriction, meaning that completely arbitrary meshes can now be converted to multiresolution form. The method is based on the approximation of an arbitrary initial mesh M by a mesh MJ that has subdivision connectivity and is guaranteed to be within a specified tolerance. The key ingredient of our algorithm is the construction of a parametrization of M over a simple domain. We expect this parametrization to be of use in other contexts, such as texture mapping or the approximation of complex meshes by NURBS patches. CR"

The conformal equivalence arises as the solution of a certain elliptic equation on the surface. Then from a triangulated surface representation of the cortex, we indicate how the procedure may be implemented using finite elements. Further, we show how the geometry of the cortical surface and gray/white matter boundary may be studied using this approach.
