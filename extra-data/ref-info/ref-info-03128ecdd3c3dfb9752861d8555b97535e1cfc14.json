We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Interneurons exhibiting centre-surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965)."

The quantity that is maximized is the Shannon information rate, or equivalently the average mutual information between input and output. Several models for the role of processing noise are analyzed, and the biological motivation for considering them is described. For simple models in which nearby input signal values (in space or time) are correlated, the cells resulting from this optimization process include center-surround cells and cells sensitive to temporal variations in input signal."

I describe a local synaptic Learning rule that performs stochastic gradient ascent in this information-theoretic quantity, for the case in which the input-output mapping is linear and the input signal and noise are multivariate gaussian. Feedforward connection strengths are modified by a Hebbian rule during a \"learning\" phase in which examples of input signal plus noise are presented to the network, and by an anti-Hebbian rule during an \"unlearning\" phase in which examples of noise alone are presented. Each recurrent lateral connection has two values of connection strength, one for each phase; these values are updated by an anti-Hebbian rule."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."
