This paperl does not attempt to present a semantic theory of a natural language, but rather to characterize the form of such a theory. A semantic theory of a natural language is part of a linguistic description of that language. Our problem, on the other hand, is part of the general theory of language, fully on a par with the problem of characterizing the structure of grammars of natural languages. A characterization of the abstract form of a semantic theory is given by a metatheory which answers such questions as these: What is the domain of a semantic theory? What are the descriptive and explanatory goals of a semantic theory? What mechanisms are employed in pursuit of these goals? What are the empirical and methodological constraints upon a semantic theory? The present paper approaches the problem of characterizing the form of semantic theories by describing the structure of a semantic theory of English. There can be little doubt but that the results achieved will apply directly to semantic theories of languages closely related to English. The question of their applicability to semantic theories of more distant languages will be left for subsequent investigations to explore. Nevertheless, the present investigation will provide results that can be applied to semantic theories of languages unrelated to English and suggestions about how to proceed with the construction of such theories. We may put our problem this way: What form should a semantic theory of a natural language take to accommodate in the most revealing way the facts about the semantic structure of that language supplied by descriptive research? This question is of primary importance at the present stage of the development of semantics because semantics suffers not from a dearth of facts about meanings and meaning relations in natural languages, but rather from the lack of an adequate theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these facts. Facts about the semantics of natural languages have been contributed in abundance by many diverse fields, including philosophy, linguistics, philology, and \u2026"

                "text": "This paper describes an operable automatic parser for natural language. The parser is not concerned with producing the syntactic structure of an input sentence. Instead, it is a conceptual parser, concerned with determining the underlying meaning of the input. Given a natural language input, the parser identifies and disambiguates the concepts derivable from that input and places them into a network that explicates their inter-relations with respect to the unambiguous meaning of the input.The parser utilizes a conceptually-oriented dependency grammar that has as its highest level the network which represents the underlying conceptual structure of a linguistic input. The parser also incorporates a language-free semantics that checks all possible conceptual dependencies with its own knowledge of the world.The parser is capable of learning new words and new constructions. It presently has a vocabulary of a few hundred words which enables it to operate in a psychiatric interviewing program without placing any restriction on the linguistic input.The theory behind the conceptual dependency is outlined in this paper and the parsing algorithm is explained in some detail."
