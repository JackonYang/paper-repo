The approach provides a means for controlling and reducing quantizing noise in the coding. Each sub-band is quantized with an accuracy (bit allocation) based upon perceptual criteria. As a result, the quality of the coded signal is improved over that obtained from a single full-band coding of the total spectrum. In one implementation, the individual sub-bands are low-pass translated before coding. In another, \u201cinteger-band\u201d sampling is employed to alias the signal in an advantageous way before coding. Other possibilities extend to complex demodulation of the sub-bands, and to representing the sub-band signals in terms of envelopes and phase-derivatives. In all techniques, adaptive quantization is used for the coding, and a parsimonious allocation of bits is made across the bands. Computer simulations are made to demonstrate the signal qualities obtained for codings at 16 and 9.6 kb/s."

Practical system application is attained by maintaining a balance between complexity of implementation and performance. FDCT sub-blocks are sorted into four classes according to level of image activity, measured by the total ac energy within each sub-block. Adaptivity is provided by distributing bits between classes, favoring higher levels of activity over lower levels. Excellent performance is demonstrated in terms of mean square error and direct comparison of original and reconstructed images. Results are presented for both noiseless and noisy transmission at a total rate of 1 bit and 0.5 bit per pixel for a monochrome image and for a total rate of 2 bits and 1 bit per pixel for a color image. In every case the total bit rate includes all overhead required for image reconstruction and bit protection."

Use of QMF's enables to avoid the aliasing effects due to samples decimation when signal is split into sub-bands. Each sub-band is then coded independently with use of Block Companded PCM (BCPCM) quantizers. Then a variable number of bits is allocated to each sub-band quantizer in order to take advantage of the relative perceptual effect of the quantizing error. The paper is organized as follows: - First, splitting in two sub-bands with QMF's is analysed. -Then, a general description of a splitband voice coding scheme using QMF's is made. -Finally, two coding schemes are considered, operating respectively at 16 KBps and 32 KBps. Averaged values of S/N performances are given when encoding both male and female voices. Comparisons are made with conventional BCPCM and CCITT A-Law. Taped results will be played at the conference."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

These filters provide a significant improvement over conventional optimal equiripple and window designs when used in QMF banks. The performance criterion for these filters differ from those usually used for filter design in a way which makes the usual filter design techniques difficult to apply. Two filters are actually designed simultaneously, with constraints on the stop band rejection, transition band width, and pass and transition band performance of the QMF filter structure made from those filters. Unlike most filter design problems, the behavior of the transition band is constrained, which places unusual requirements on the design algorithm. The requirement that the overall passband behavior of the QMF bank be constrained (which is a function of the passband and stop band behavior of the filter) also places very unusual requirements on the filter design. The filters were designed using a Hooke and Jeaves optimization routine with a Hanning window prototype. Theoretical results suggest that exactly flat frequency designs cannot be created for filter lengths greater than 2, however, using the discussed procedure, one can obtain QMF banks with as little as \u00b1.0015dB ripple in their frequency response. Due to the nature of QMF filter applications, a small set of filters can be derived which will fit most applications."
