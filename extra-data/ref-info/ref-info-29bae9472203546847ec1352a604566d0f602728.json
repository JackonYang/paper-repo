A number of face recognition algorithms employ principal component analysis (PCA), which is based on the second-order statistics of the image set, and does not address high-order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a generalization of PCA which separates the high-order moments of the input in addition to the second-order moments. ICA was performed on a set of face images by an unsupervised learning algorithm derived from the principle of optimal information transfer through sigmoidal neurons. The algorithm maximizes the mutual information between the input and the output, which produces statistically independent outputs under certain conditions. ICA was performed on the face images under two different architectures. The first architecture provided a statistically independent basis set for the face images that can be viewed as a set of independent facial features. The second architecture provided a factorial code, in which the probability of any combination of features can be obtained from the product of their individual probabilities. Both ICA representations were superior to representations based on principal components analysis for recognizing faces across sessions and changes in expression."

                "text": "The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges, and cones. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

The diversity of tasks that any biological recognition system must solve suggests that object recognition is not a single, general purpose process. In this review, we consider evidence from the fields of psychology, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology, all of which supports the idea that there are multiple systems for recognition. Data from normal adults, infants, animals, and brain damaged patients reveal a major distinction between the classification of objects at a basic category level and the identification of individual objects from a homogeneous object class. An additional distinction between object representations used for visual perception and those used for visually guided movements provides further support for a multiplicity of visual recognition systems. Recent evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies indicates that one system may represent objects by combinations of multiple views, or aspects, and another may represent objects by structural primitives and their spatial interrelationships."

The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched."

Cells responsive to the sight of the entire human body (but no to control stimuli) were tested with two subregions (head alone with the body occluded from sight and the body alone with the head occluded). Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded to the whole body and to one of the two body regions tested separately: 72% (17 of 22) responding to the head and 28% (5 of 22) to the rest of the body. Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded independently to both regions of the body when tested in isolation. The remaining cells (17%, 9 of 53) were selective for the entire body and unresponsive to component parts. The majority of cells tested (90%, 35 of 39) were selective for perspective view (e.g., some cells respond optimally to the side view of the body, others to the back view). Comparable levels of view sensitivity were found for responses to the whole body and its parts. Results indicate (1) separate neuronal analysis of body parts and (2) extensive integration of information from different parts. Contrary to influential models of object recognition (Marr and Nishihara, 1978; Biederman, 1987), the results indicate view-specific processing both for the appearance of separate object components and for integration of information across components."

Electrophysiological recordings from single cells have revealed a remarkably close relationship among stimuli, neural activity, and perceptual states. The nature of this relationship and interpretations of experimental results are fiercely debated. Is sensory information represented by the activity of single, individually meaningful cells, or is it only the global activity pattern across a whole cell population that corresponds to interpretable states? There are now strong theoretical reasons and experimental evidence suggesting that the brain adopts a compromise between these extremes which is often referred to as sparse coding."

Application of the generic sampling principle indicates that the visual system acts as if it were viewing surface layouts from generic not accidental vantage points. Through the observer's experience of optical sampling, which can be characterized geometrically, the visual system makes associative connections between images and surfaces, passively internalizing the conditional probabilities of image sampling from surfaces. This in turn enables the visual system to determine which surface a given image most strongly indicates. Thus, visual surface perception can be considered as inverse ecological optics based on learning through ecological optics. As such, it is formally equivalent to a degenerate form of Bayesian inference where prior probabilities are neglected."

Aggregate Markov models are classbased bigram models in which the mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of models are trained by ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations."

We give a more accurate general mathematical model for ET where an unknown emission density \u00bf = \u00bf(x, y, z) generates, and is to be reconstructed from, the number of counts n*(d) in each of D detector units d. Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate \u00bf of \u00bf which maximizes the probability p(n*|\u00bf) of observing the actual detector count data n* over all possible densities \u00bf. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means \u00bf(b), b = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter. Suppose each emission in box b is detected in detector unit d with probability p(b, d), d = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, D with p(b, d) a one-step transition matrix, assumed known. We observe the total number n* = n*(d) of emissions in each detector unit d and want to estimate the unknown \u00bf = \u00bf(b), b = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, B. For each \u00bf, the observed data n* has probability or likelihood p(n*|\u00bf). The EM algorithm of mathematical statistics starts with an initial estimate \u00bf0 and gives the following simple iterative procedure for obtaining a new estimate \u00bfnew, from an old estimate \u00bfold, to obtain \u00bfk, k = 1, 2, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, \u00bfnew(b)= \u00bfold(b) \u00bfDd=1 n*(d)p(b,d)/\u00bf\u00bfold(b\u00bf)p(b\u00bf,d),b=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7B."

The upper limit is derived from information on the primary productivity of the oceans, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary production and diatom Si/C ratios. The lower limit is derived independently using a multi-compartment model of nutrient transport and biogenic particle flux, and field data on the balance between silica production and dissolution in the upper ocean. Our upper limit is 30\u201350% lower than several previous estimates, due to new data indicating lower values for both the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity and their Si/C ratios. Globally, at least 50% of the silica produced by diatoms in the euphotic zone dissolves in the upper 100 m, resulting in an estimated export of 100\u2013140 \u00d7 1012 mol Si yr\u2212l to the deep ocean. Our estimates correspond to a global mean rate of biogenic silica production between 0.6 and 0.8 mol Si m\u22122 yr\u22121. Incubation experiments indicate that silica production rates exceed that mean by a factor of 3\u201312 in coastal areas and are 2\u20134 times less than the global average in the oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres. The mean silica production rate in waters overlying diatomaceous sediments (approximately 10\u201312% of the surface area of the oceans) is 0.7\u20131.2 mol Si m\u22122 yr\u22121. That rate is only slightly higher than the global average, indicating that the silica produced in those regions is only 10\u201325% of the global total. The estimated production of biogenic silica in surface waters of the mid-ocean gyres is approximately equal to that for all major areas of opal sediment accumulation combined. Regional comparison of silica production and accumulation rates suggests a strongly bimodal character in the efficiency of opal preservation in the sea. In waters overlying diatom-rich sediments 15\u201325% of the silica produced in the surface layer accumulates in the seabed, while virtually none of the silica produced in other areas is preserved. The global burial/production ratio of \u02dc 3% is a composite of those two very different systems. The mechanisms leading to more efficient opal preservation in regions of silica accumulation are presently unknown, but they have no simple relationship to primary productivity. Regional differences in opal preservation appear to be controlled by factors such as low surface temperature, selective grazing and aggregate formation, which diminish the rate of silica dissolution in surface waters and/or accelerate its transport to the seafloor."

                "text": "In the modern oceans, the removal of dissolved silica from sea water is principally a biological process carried out by diatoms, with lesser contributions from radiolaria, silicoflagellates, and sponges. Because such silica in sediments is often redistributed locally during diagenesis to from nodular or bedded chert, stratigraphic changes in the facies distribution of early diagenetic chert provide important insights into the development of biological participation in the silica cycle. The abundance of chert in upper Proterozoic peritidal carbonates suggests that at this time silica was removed from seawater principally by abiological processes operating in part of the margins of the oceans. With the evolution of demosponges near the beginning of the Cambrian Period, subtidal biogenetic cherts became increasingly common, and with the Ordovician rise of radiolaria to ecological and biogeochemical prominence, sedimented skeletons became a principal sink for oceanic silica. Cherts of Silurian to Cretaceous age share many features of facies distribution and petrography but they differ from Cenozoic siliceous deposits. These differences are interpreted to reflect the mid-Cretaceous radiation of diatoms and their subsequent rise to domination of the silica cycle. Biogeochemical cycles provide an important framework for the paleobiological interpretation of the organisms that participate in them."

They can play an important role for the silica budget especially in the shallow water areas of the Baltic Sea. The dependence of the silica uptake rate on the silica concentration of the seawater was measured for the sponge Halichondria panicea (Pallas, 1766). The sponges were collected in Kiel Bight. The uptake conformed to Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with a half-saturation constant of 46.41\u2009\u03bcM and a saturated uptake rate of 19.33\u2009\u03bcmol h\u22121\u2009g\u22121 (\u200ap\u2009<\u20090.01). In the red algae zone of Kiel Bight the sponges depend on silica supply from the surrounding waters and may be silica-limited rather than food-limited in growth. Because of the much faster uptake of silica by diatoms and their lower saturation point, as well as the difference in spatial distribution of the two main silica consumers, a competition for silica between sponges and diatoms seems unlikely."

Quelques regles generales de distribution verticale des diverses classes sont mises en evidence, avec une attention particuliere pour les formes susceptibles de se fossiliser gr\u00e2ce a leur squelette calcaire ou siliceux coherent. Ces formes, qui appartiennent a des groupes polyphyletiques, sont actuellement tres sciaphiles et liees a des eaux chaudes ou temperees. Les eponges calcifiees (Pharetronides de la classe Calcarea, Sclerosponges de la classe Demospongea) vivent preferentiellement dans l'habitat cryptique littoral et sur le debut de la pente continentale. Les Demosponges Lithistides ont le maximum d'especes sur la pente continentale entre 200 et 700 m et occupent de facon marginale les habitats littoraux. Les Hexactinellides Dictyonines sont bathyales et peuvent atteindre la zone abyssale."

However, molecular data, morphology, and paleontology confirm recent hypothesis of polyphyly for this enigmatic group of sponges. Parsimony and neighbor-joining analysis of partial 18S rDNA sequences derived from amplified genomic rDNA of lithistids and other demosponges suggest that tetracladinid and dicranocladinid lithistids are monophyletic and closely related to choristid demosponges. Rhizomorinid families, in contrast, are indicated as being polyphyletic, with a diversity of points of origin within the tetractinomorph and the ceractinomorph poriferan subclasses. These arrangements are discussed in light of several hypotheses of demosponge evolution."

Diatoms did not enter the cycle until Jurassic time, but now account for as much as 90 percent of the suspended silica in the oceans. It is postulated that the tremendous evolutionary success of the diatoms is responsible for evolutionary trends observable in the Cenozoic fossil record of the Radiolaria. Such trends include decrease in test weight, as well as structural changes such as increased pore size, decreased bar width, reduction or loss of test processes, and more regular alignment of pores\u2013all changes that result in less silica uptake per test. Natural selection, mediated by the role of the diatoms in the silica cycle, apparently favors radiolarian phenotypes which use less silica in test construction."
