LDA is equivalent to maximum likelihood classification assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. In this paper, we fit Gaussian mixtures to each class to facilitate effective classification in non-normal settings, especially when the classes are clustered. Low dimensional views are an important by-product of LDA-our new techniques inherit this feature. We can control the within-class spread of the subclass centres relative to the between-class spread. Our technique for fitting these models permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions of LDA."

With a large number of predictors, one can find a reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are \u201coptimal\u201d for separating the groups. With two such functions, one can produce a classification map that partitions the reduced space into regions that are identified with group membership, and the decision boundaries are linear. This article is about richer nonlinear classification schemes. Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multiresponse linear regression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. In this paper, we obtain nonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way, any multiresponse regression technique (such as MARS or neural networks) can be postprocessed to improve its classification performance."

We provide an alternative justification for maximal margin hyperplane classifiers by relating them to Bayes optimal classifiers that use Parzen windows estimations with Gaussian kernels. For any value of the smoothing parameter (the width of the Gaussian kernels), the Bayes optimal classifier defines a density over the space of instances. We define the Bayes optimal hyperplaneto be the hyperplane decision boundary that gives lowest probability of classification error relative to this densit y. We show that, for linearly separable data, as we reduce the smoothing parameter to zero, a hyperplane is the Bayes optimal hyperplane if and only if it is the maximal margin hyperplane. We also analyze the behavior of the Bayes optimal hyperplane for non-linearly-separable data, showing that it has a very natural form. We explore the idea of using the hyperplane that is optimal relative to a density with some small non-zero kernel width, and present some promising preliminary results."

We first discuss the geometry of feature space. In particular, we review what is known about the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this influences the capacity of SV methods. Following this, we describe how the metric governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels, which are often used in SV pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space. We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications of kernel methods. First, we use it to reduce the computational complexity of SV decision functions; second, we combine it with the Kernel PCA algorithm, thereby constructing a nonlinear statistical denoising technique which is shown to perform well on real-world data."

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

Pattern recognition in general covers a wide range of problems: it is applied to engineering problems, such as character readers and wave form analysis as well as to brain modeling in biology and psychology. Statistical decision and estimation, which are the main subjects of this book, are regarded as fundamental to the study of pattern recognition. This book is appropriate as a text for introductory courses in pattern recognition and as a reference book for workers in the field. Each chapter contains computer projects as well as exercises."
