A recognition accuracy of 99.35% is obtained using frontal views of 155 individuals. This figure is consistent with the 95% recognition rate obtained previously on a much larger database of 7,562 `mugshots' of approximately 3,000 individuals, consisting of a mix of all age and ethnic groups. We also demonstrate that we can automatically determine head pose without significantly lowering recognition accuracy; this is accomplished by use of a view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique. In addition, a modular eigenspace description is used which incorporates salient facial features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields slightly higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. In addition, a robust and automatic feature detection technique using eigentemplates is demonstrated."

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with three sample sizes, ranging from n = 10 to 50, to assess type I error rates and the power of the tests to detect group differences for two- and three-dimensional representations of forms. Type I error rates for EMM were at or below nominal levels in both two and three dimensions. Procrustes in 2D and EDMA in 2D and 3D produced inflated type I error rates in all conditions, but approached acceptable levels with moderate cell sizes. Procrustes maintained error rates below the nominal levels in 2D. The power of EMM was high compared with the other methods in both 2D and 3D, but, conflicting EMM decisions were provided depending on which pair (2D) or triad (3D) of landmarks were selected as reference points. EDMA and Procrustes were more powerful in 2D data than for 3D data. Interpretation of these results must take into account that the data used in this simulation were selected because they represent real data that might have been collected during a study or experiment. These data had characteristics which violated assumptions central to the methods here with unequal variances about landmarks, correlated errors, and correlated landmark locations; therefore these results may not generalize to all conditions, such as cases with no violations of assumptions. This simulation demonstrates, however, limitations of each procedure that should be considered when making inferences about shape comparisons."
