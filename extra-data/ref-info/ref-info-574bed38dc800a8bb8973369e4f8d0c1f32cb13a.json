The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

We have chosen a functional form of the posterior probability function that captures the joint statistics of local appearance and position on the object as well as the statistics of local appearance in the visual world at large. We use a discrete representation of local appearance consisting of approximately 10/sup 6/ patterns. We compute an estimate of P(object/image) in closed form by counting the frequency of occurrence of these patterns over various sets of training images. We have used this method for detecting human faces from frontal and profile views. The algorithm for frontal views has shown a detection rate of 93.0% with 88 false alarms on a set of 125 images containing 483 faces combining the MIT test set of Sung and Poggio with the CMU test sets of Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade. The algorithm for detection of profile views has also demonstrated promising results."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Because of this property, researchers have attempted to use affine invariants for recognition. However, there are two problems with this approach: (1) objects or object classes with inherent variability cannot be adequately treated using invariants; and (2) in practice the calculated affine invariants can be quite sensitive to errors in the image plane measurements. In this paper we use probability distributions to address both of these difficulties. Under the assumption that the feature positions of a planar object can be modeled using a jointly Gaussian density, we have derived the joint density over the corresponding set of affine coordinates. Even when the assumptions of a planar object and a weak perspective camera model do not strictly hold, the results are useful because deviations from the ideal can be treated as deformability in the underlying object model."
