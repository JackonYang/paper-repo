This book discusses the construction and training of models, computational approaches to efficient implementation, and parallel implementations in biologically plausible neural network architectures. The approach is based on statistical modeling and estimation, with an emphasis on simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency. \nThe book describes a range of deformable template models, from coarse sparse models involving discrete, fast computations to more finely detailed models based on continuum formulations, involving intensive optimization. Each model is defined in terms of a subset of points on a reference grid (the template), a set of admissible instantiations of these points (deformations), and a statistical model for the data given a particular instantiation of the object present in the image. A recurring theme is a coarse to fine approach to the solution of vision problems. The book provides detailed descriptions of the algorithms used as well as the code, and the software and data sets are available on the Web."

                "text": "Classification of pre-segmented images and detection of objects in images are two fundamental problems in computer vision. Traditional approaches to these problems involve the use of nonparametric classifiers that use training data to explicitly learn boundaries between various object categories (for classification) or between the object and non-object populations (for detection). In recent years, attention has turned to the use of statistical models to represent object categories, although these are frequently complex Bayesian models that are carefully constructed for a particular type of object. \nWe present an alternative approach, using straightforward statistical mixture models that can be estimated using the EM algorithm and applied to a wide variety of object categories. The same model form is used both to learn a collection of generic local features and to learn a model for each object category of interest. In its simplest form, the local feature model identifies each non-background local image patch with one or more indices, indicating the features found at that location. By adding additional latent variables to the mixture, the feature set can be extended to encode additional information, such as feature orientation and polarity. \nWe demonstrate the utility of this framework through three visual tasks: classification of pre-segmented handwritten digits, detection of car profiles in photographs, and detection of faces. When performing classification, the likelihood of the observed data is calculated under the model for each category, and the category with the highest likelihood is selected. For detection, likelihood ratio tests are computed using a coarse-to-fine computational strategy that focuses attention on image regions likely to contain the object of interest. If orientation information has been incorporated into the local features, the object models can be rotated to allow detection of objects at a variety of poses. Of particular note is the fact that the object detector can be learned using only data from the category of interest; no non-object examples are required."

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling.

These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization, and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure, such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower computational cost."

To cope with variation in object orientation, the detector uses multiple classifiers, each spanning a different range of orientation. Each of these classifiers determines whether the object is present at a specified size within a fixed-size image window. To find the object at any location and size, these classifiers scan the image exhaustively.Each classifier is based on the statistics of localized parts. Each part is a transform from a subset of wavelet coefficients to a discrete set of values. Such parts are designed to capture various combinations of locality in space, frequency, and orientation. In building each classifier, we gathered the class-conditional statistics of these part values from representative samples of object and non-object images. We trained each classifier to minimize classification error on the training set by using Adaboost with Confidence-Weighted Predictions (Shapire and Singer, 1999). In detection, each classifier computes the part values within the image window and looks up their associated class-conditional probabilities. The classifier then makes a decision by applying a likelihood ratio test. For efficiency, the classifier evaluates this likelihood ratio in stages. At each stage, the classifier compares the partial likelihood ratio to a threshold and makes a decision about whether to cease evaluation\u2014labeling the input as non-object\u2014or to continue further evaluation. The detector orders these stages of evaluation from a low-resolution to a high-resolution search of the image. Our trainable object detector achieves reliable and efficient detection of human faces and passenger cars with out-of-plane rotation."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

We provide a careful definition and analysis of a well\u2010defined statistical model based on dense deformable templates for grey level images of deformable objects. We propose a rigorous Bayesian framework for which we prove asymptotic consistency of the maximum a posteriori estimate and which leads to an effective iterative estimation algorithm of the geometric and photometric parameters in the small sample setting. The model is extended to mixtures of finite numbers of such components leading to a fine description of the photometric and geometric variations of an object class. We illustrate some of the ideas with images of handwritten digits and apply the estimated models to classification through maximum likelihood."

During indexing a list of instantiations (shape identities and poses) is compiled, constrained only by no missed detections at the expense of false positives. Global information, such as expected relationships among poses, is incorporated afterward to remove ambiguities. This division is motivated by computational efficiency. In addition, indexing itself is organized as a coarse-to-fine search simultaneously in class and pose. This search can be interpreted as successive approximations to likelihood ratio tests arising from a simple (\"naive Bayes\") statistical model for the edge maps extracted from the original images. The key to constructing efficient \"hypothesis tests\" for multiple classes and poses is local ORing; in particular, spread edges provide imprecise but common and locally invariant features. Natural tradeoffs then emerge between discrimination and the pattern of spreading. These are analyzed mathematically within the model-based framework and the whole procedure is illustrated by experiments in reading license plates."

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection"

Of particular interest is the use of the features as variables in simple statistical models for the objects thus enabling likelihood based classification. Pre-training decision boundaries between classes, a necessary component of non-parametric techniques, are thus avoided. Class models are trained separately with no need to access data of other classes.

The splines are adjusted using a novel elastic matching procedure based on the expectation maximization algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of the model generating the data. This approach has many advantages: 1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation; 3) the method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is relatively easy and fast; and 4) unlike many other recognition schemes, it does not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. We have demonstrated that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima. The main disadvantage of the method is that it requires much more computation than more standard OCR techniques."

                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

Detectors involving a hierarchy of tests based on edges have been used elsewhere and shown to be quite fast online. However, significant further gains in efficiency in representation, error rates and computation can be realized if the family of detectors is constructed from common parts. Our parts are flexible, extended edge configurations; they are learned, not pre-designed. In training, object classes are presented sequentially; the objective is then to accommodate new classes by maximally reusing parts. Ideally, the number of distinct parts in the system would grow much more slowly than linearly with the number of classes.

                "text": "This thesis is concerned with the problem of visual object categorization, that is of reeognizing unseen-before objects, localizing them in cluttered real-worid images, and assigning the correct category label. This capability is one of the core compe\u00ac tencies of the human visual system. Yet, Computer vision Systems are still far from reaching a comparable level of Performance.Moreover,Computer visionresearch has in the past mainly focused on the simpler and more specific problem of identifying known objects under novel viewing conditions. The visual categorization problem is closely linked to the task of figure-ground segmentation, that is of dividing the image into an object and a non-objeet part. Historically, figure-ground segmentation has often been seen as an important and even necessary preprocessing step for object recognition. However, purely bottomup approacheshave so far been unable to yield segmentationsof sufficient quality, so that most current recognition approacheshave been designed to work independently from segmentation. In contrast,this thesis considers object categorization and figure-ground segmen\u00ac tation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. The core part of our work is a probabilisticformulation which integrates both capabilities into a common framework. As shown in our experiments, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to profit from each other and improve their individual Performances. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically compute a segmentationfor them. This segmenta\u00ac tion is then used to again improve recognition by allowing the System to focus its effort on object pixels and discard misleading influencesfrom the background. In addition to improving the recognition Performance for individual hypotheses, the top-down segmentation also allows to determine exactly from where a hypoth\u00ac esis draws its support. We use this information to design a hypothesis verification stage based on the MDL principle that resolves ambiguities between overlapping hypotheseson a per-pixel level and factorsout the effects of partialocclusion. Altogether, this procedureconstitutes a novel mechanismin object detection that allows to analyze scenes containing multiple objects in a principled manner. Our results show that it presents an improvement over conventional criteria based on bounding box overlap and permitsmore aecurate aeeeptancedecisions. Our approach is based on a highly flexible implicit representation for object shape that can combine the information of local parts observed on different training exam\u00ac ples and interpolate between the correspondingobjects. As a result, the proposed method can learn object modeis already from few training examples and achieve competitive object detection Performance with training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable Systems. An extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the system is applicable to many different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales.

The model integrates two major tasks in handwriting recognition: the segmentation of a sequence of characters into its individual components, and the recognition of these individual components. \nWe express the joint distribution of the segmentation, recognition, and image as a product of three terms: a term expressing our prior belief in the plausibility of the segmentation; a term expressing the plausibility of the segmentation and the image; and a term expressing the plausibility of the recognition, segmentation, and image. To calculate the third term, we incorporate a digit recognition algorithm developed by Amit, Geman, and Wilder to recognize the characters determined by a candidate segmentation. The strength of this recognition provides information about the plausibility of the segmentation. \nCombining these sources of information, we obtain a posterior distribution that simultaneously optimizes both segmentation and recognition. Summing this posterior distribution over all segmentations gives us a posterior distribution on the recognition alone, and we rake its mode as the predicted ZIP code. To make this optimization feasible, a generalized dynamic programming algorithm is implemented. \nWe describe how the model is implemented as a computer software system and present results from a test dataset of ZIP code images taken from US mail. The system uses little preprocessing, instead adapting to the image, and special adjustments are not required for slanting, touching, or overlapping characters. The system also relies little on rule-based heuristics, making extensive training or tuning unnecessary, and as a result is generalizable to any problem involving the recognition of sequences of a fixed number of visual or aural symbols."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The effects of translation, rotation, and scale are eliminated by mapping to a set of shape variables. The constellations are then ranked according to the likelihood that the shape variables correspond to a face versus an alternative model. Incomplete constellations, which occur when some of the true features are missed, are handled in a principled way."

Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function. The system differs from Lades et al. (1993) in three respects. Phase information is used for accurate node positioning. Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth. Image graph extraction is based on a novel data structure, the bunch graph, which is constructed from a small set of sample image graphs."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Herein we formalize the Brown/Washington University model of anatomy following the global pattern theory introduced in [1, 2], in which anatomies are represented as deformable templates, collections of 0,1,2,3-dimensional manifolds. Typical structure is carried by the template with the variabilities accommodated via the application of random transformations to the background manifolds. The anatomical model is a quadruple (0,W, X,V), the background space f2 = \\JaMa of 0,1,2,3-dimensional manifolds, the set of diffeomorphic transformations on the background space W : <-> O, the space of idealized medical imagery X, and V the family of probability measures on H. The group of diffeomorphic transformations H is chosen to be rich enough so that a large family of shapes may be generated with the topologies of the template maintained. For normal anatomy one deformable template is studied, with (f1,H,X) corresponding to a homogeneous space [3], in that it can be completely generated from one of its elements, X = Tiltemp-, hemp \u00a3 For disease, a family of templates Ua I\"emp are introduced of perhaps varying dimensional transformation classes.

The character structure is represented by the joint distribution of the component strokes. In the proposed model, the stroke relationship is effectively reflected by the statistical dependency. It can represent all kinds of stroke relationship effectively in a systematic way. Based on the character representation, a stroke neighbor selection method is also proposed. It measures the importance of a stroke relationship by the mutual information among the strokes. With such a measure, the important neighbor relationships are selected by the nth order probability approximation method. The neighbor selection algorithm reduces the complexity significantly because we can reflect only some important relationships instead of all existing relationships. The proposed character modeling method was applied to a handwritten Chinese character recognition system. Applying a model-driven stroke extraction algorithm that cooperates with a selective matching algorithm, the proposed system is better than conventional structural recognition systems in analyzing degraded images. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was visualized by the experiments. The proposed method successfully detected and reflected the stroke relationships that seemed intuitively important. The overall recognition rate was 98.45 percent, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

We propose to make use of a scheme that iterates between correcting for intensity differences between images and performing standard monomodal registration. The core of our contribution resides in providing a method that finds the transformation that maps the intensities of one image to those of another. It makes the assumption that there are at most two functional dependences between the intensities of structures present in the images to register, and relies on robust estimation techniques to evaluate these functions. We provide results showing successful registration between several imaging modalities involving segmentations, T1 magnetic resonance (MR), T2 MR, proton density (PD) MR and computed tomography (CT)."

This method concentrates on the morphological aspect of cursive script recognition. It uses fuzzy-shape grammars to define the morphological characteristics of conventional allographs which can be viewed as basic knowledge for developing a writer independent recognition system. The system uses no linguistic knowledge to output character sequences that possibly correspond to an unknown cursive word input. The recognition method is tested using multi-writer cursive random letter sequences. For a test dataset containing a handwritten cursive text 600 characters in length written by ten different writers, average character recognition rates of 84.4% to 91.6% are obtained, depending on whether only the best character sequence output of the system is considered or if the best of the top 10 is accepted. These results are achieved without any writer-dependent tuning. The same dataset is used to evaluate the performance of human readers. An average recognition rate of 96.0% was reached, using ten different readers, presented with randomized samples of each writer. The worst reader-writer performance was 78.3%. Moreover, results show that system performances are highly correlated with human performances. >"

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

The variational problem takes the form\n \n$$\\mathop {\\arg {\\text{m}}in}\\limits_{\\upsilon :\\dot \\phi _t = \\upsilon _t \\left( {\\dot \\phi } \\right)} \\left( {\\int_0^1 {\\left\\| {\\upsilon _t } \\right\\|} ^2 {\\text{d}}t + \\left\\| {I_0 \\circ \\phi _1^{ - 1} - I_1 } \\right\\|_{L^2 }^2 } \\right),$$\n\n where \u2016vt\u2016V is an appropriate Sobolev norm on the velocity field vt(\u00b7), and the second term enforces matching of the images with \u2016\u00b7\u2016L2 representing the squared-error norm.In this paper we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations characterizing the minimizing vector fields vt, t\u2208[0, 1] assuming sufficient smoothness of the norm to guarantee existence of solutions in the space of diffeomorphisms. We describe the implementation of the Euler equations using semi-lagrangian method of computing particle flows and show the solutions for various examples. As well, we compute the metric distance on several anatomical configurations as measured by \u222b01\u2016vt\u2016Vdt on the geodesic shortest paths."

To assist in processing this large volume of mail, USPS and the Center for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR) have been exploring automation methods for processing letter mail with handwritten addresses. The CEDAR system for locating and reading destination address blocks on letter mail pieces operates at real\u2010time rates. The system architecture uses a variety of pipelining and multiprocessor techniques to achieve the required processing speed and minimize latency. Image processing operations are performed using specialized hardware operating at 103 ns/pixel. This hardware includes CCITT Group 3 (FAX) decompression, image enhancement, and conversion of the image representation from pixel\u2010based representation to symbolic representation. This symbolic representation of the image can be processed in real time using software running on general\u2010purpose processors. This software performs the address block location (ABL), handwritten address interpretation (HWAI), and data base querying needed to determine the delivery point of the mail piece. The current system can correctly locate and produce a five\u2010digit ZIP code with an accuracy of 66% on a test set of 1566 handwritten mail pieces. A unique delivery point (e.g., ZIP + 4 code) can be determined on these same mail pieces 26% of the time. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Furthermore these models are learned in a discriminative framework - object against background.
