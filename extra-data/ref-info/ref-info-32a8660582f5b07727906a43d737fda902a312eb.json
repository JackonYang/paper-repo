The model permits separate treatment of image components which correspond approximately to periodicity, directionality, and randomness. The authors compare its performance in an image search application to two other methods-one based on shift-invariant principle components and one based on a multiscale simultaneous autoregressive model. When textured images are ordered by distances between their Wold components, the results appear to be much closer to the human perception of similarity. The authors discuss how decoupling the three components can increase flexibility for measuring image similarity and can save computation, permitting the \"quickest\" matches when the features are the most perceptually \"salient\".<<ETX>>"

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"

The algorithm is based on the steerable filters of Freeman and Adelson (IEEE Trans. PAMI 13, 891-906, 1991), orientation-selective filters derived from derivatives of Gaussians. The filters are applied over multiple scales and their outputs non-linearly contrast-normalized. The data for humans were collected from forty subjects who were asked to identify 'the minimum number of dominant orientations' they perceived, and the 'strength' with which they perceived each orientation. Test data consisted of 111 grey-level images of natural textures taken from the Brodatz album, a standard collection used in computer vision and image processing. Results show that the computer and humans chose at least one of the same dominant orientations on 95 of the natural textures. Of these textures, 74 were also in 100% agreement on the location of all the dominant orientations chosen by both humans and computer. Disagreements are analyzed and possible causes are discussed. Some apparent limitations in the current filter shapes and sizes are illustrated, as well as some (surprisingly small) effects believed to be caused by semantic recognition and gestalt grouping."

Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The rationale behind this is to exploit the sensitivity of the human visual system to texture in order to overcome the limitations inherent in the display of multidimensional data. A fundamental issue that must be addressed is what textural features are important in texture perception, and how they are used. We designed an experiment to help identify the relevant higher order features of texture perceived by humans. We used twenty subjects, who were asked to rate 56 pictures from Brodatz's album on 12 nine-point Likert scales. We applied the techniques of hierarchical cluster analysis, non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS), classification and regression tree analysis (CART), discriminant analysis, and principal component analysis to data gathered from the subjects. Based on these techniques, we identified three orthogonal dimensions for texture to be repetitive vs. non-repetitive; high-contrast and non-directional vs. low-contrast and directional; granular, coarse and low-complexity vs. non-granular, fine and high-complexity.<<ETX>>"

This question might be taken to mean, What are the fundamental atoms of vision?\u2014and might be variously answered in terms ofsuch candidate structures as edges, peaks, corners, and so on. In this chapter we adopt a rather different point of view and ask the question, What are the fundamentalsubstances of vision? This distinction is important becausewe wish to focus on the first steps in extraction of visualinformation. At this level it is premature to talk aboutdiscrete objects, even such simple ones as edges and corners.There is general agreement that early vision involvesmeasurements of a number of basic image properties in-cluding orientation, color, motion, and so on. Figure l.lshows a caricature (in the style of Neisser, 1976), of the sort of architecture that has become quite popular as a model for both human and machine vision. The first stageof processing involves a set of parallel pathways, eachdevoted to one particular-visual property. We propose that the measurements of these basic properties be con-sidered as the elements of early vision. We think of earlyvision as measuring the amounts of various kinds of vi-sual \"substances\" present in the image (e.g., redness orrightward motion energy). In other words, we are inter- ested in how early vision measures \u201cstuff\u201d rather than in how it labels \u201cthings.\u201dWhat, then, are these elementary visual substances?Various lists have been compiled using a mixture of intui-tion and experiment. Electrophysiologists have describedneurons in striate cortex that are selectively sensitive tocertain visual properties; for reviews, see Hubel (1988) and DeValois and DeValois (1988). Psychophysicists haveinferred the existence of channels that are tuned for cer- tain visual properties; for reviews, see Graham (1989), Olzak and Thomas (1986), Pokorny and Smith (1986), and Watson (1986). Researchers in perception have foundaspects of visual stimuli that are processed pre-attentive- ly (Beck, 1966; Bergen & Julesz, 1983; Julesz & Bergen,"

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."
