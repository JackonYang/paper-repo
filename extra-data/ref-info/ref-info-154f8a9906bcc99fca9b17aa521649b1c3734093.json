The indexing scheme, designated as a 'Classification Space' consists of a Euclidean model for mapping subject matter similarity within a given subject matter domain. A scheme of this kind is empirically derived for certain fields of Engineering and Chemistry. A set of five related empirical studies provide convincing evidence that when appropriate experimental procedures are followed a very stable C-Space for a given content domain can be constructed on a surprisingly small data base. Other empirical studies demonstrate specific computational procedures for effective automatic indexing of documents in a C-Space, using a relatively small system vocabulary."

In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper."
