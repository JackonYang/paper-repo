The method uses three statistical features, two of which are obtained from a new parametric model of the image called a ``circular symmetric autoregressive model.'' Two of the proposed features have physical interpretation in terms of the roughness and directionality of the texture. The results of several classification experiments on differently oriented samples of natural textures including both microtextures and macrotextures are presented."

These features are derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, local statistics, and lognormal random field models. The features are compared based on: (i) their invariance or robustness with respect to natural changes in SAR signatures; and (ii) their discrimination ability and classification accuracy. The invariance of the texture features is investigated on a set of 13 ERS-1 SAR images of the same scene, captured under different conditions. Two main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (i) the texture features are not invariant with respect to natural changes in the mean backscatter values; and (ii) texture fusion and selection by combining texture features obtained by different models significantly improve the classification accuracy."

Existing procedures for feature subset selection, such as sequential selection and dynamic programming, do not guarantee optimality of the selected feature subset. Exhaustive search, on the other hand, is generally computationally unfeasible. The present algorithm is very efficient and it selects the best subset without exhaustive search. Computational aspects of the algorithm are discussed. Results of several experiments demonstrate the very substantial computational savings realized. For example, the best 12-feature set from a 24-feature set was selected with the computational effort of evaluating only 6000 subsets. Exhaustive search would require the evaluation of 2 704 156 subsets."

First, it describes our use of Genetic Algorithms combined with a K-nearest neighbor algorithm to optimize classiication by searching for an optimal feature weight-ing, essentially warping the feature space to coalesce individuals within groups and to separate groups from one another. This approach has proven especially useful with large data sets where standard feature selection techniques are computationally expensive. Second, it describes our implementation of the approach in a parallel processing environment, giving nearly linear speed-up in processing time. Third, it will summarize our present results in using the technique to discover the relative importance of features in large biological test sets. Finally, it will indicate areas for future research. 1 The Problem We live in the age of information where data is plentiful , to the extent that we are typically unable to process all of it usefully. Computer science has been challenged to discover approaches that can sort through the mountains of data available and discover the essential features needed to answer a speciic question. These approaches must be able to process large quantities of data, in reasonable time and in the presence of \\noisy\" data i.e., irrelevant or erroneous data. Consider a typical example in biology. Researchers in the Center for Microbial Ecology (CME) have selected soil samples from three environments found in agriculture. The environments were: near the roots of a crop (rhizosphere), away from the innuence of the crop roots (non-rhizosphere), and from a fallow eld (crop residue). The CME researchers wished to investigate whether samples from those three environments could be distinguished. In particular, they wanted to see if diversity decreased in the rhizosphere as a result of the symbiotic relationship between the roots and its near-neighbor microbes, and if so in what ways. Their rst experiments used the Biolog c test as the discriminator. Biolog consists of a plate of 96 wells, with a diierent substrate in each well. These sub-strates (various sugars, amino acids and other nutrients) are assimilated by some microbes and not by others. If the microbial sample processes the substrate in the well, that well changes color which can be recorded photometrically. Thus large numbers of samples can be processed and characterized based on the substrates they can assimilate. The CME researchers applied the Biolog test to 3 sets of 100 samples \u2026"

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>"

The performance of wavelet packet spaces are measured in terms of sensitivity and selectivity for the classification of twenty-five natural textures. Both energy and entropy metrics were computed for each wavelet packet and incorporated into distinct scale space representations, where each wavelet packet (channel) reflected a specific scale and orientation sensitivity. Wavelet packet representations for twenty-five natural textures were classified without error by a simple two-layer network classifier. An analyzing function of large regularity (D/sub 20/) was shown to be slightly more efficient in representation and discrimination than a similar function with fewer vanishing moments (D/sub 6/) In addition, energy representations computed from the standard wavelet decomposition alone (17 features) provided classification without error for the twenty-five textures included in our study. The reliability exhibited by texture signatures based on wavelet packets analysis suggest that the multiresolution properties of such transforms are beneficial for accomplishing segmentation, classification and subtle discrimination of texture. >"

A node-pruning procedure is then presented to remove insalient nodes in the network to create a parsimonious network.

The performance of the proposed approach for feature selection is compared with Whitney's feature selection method. One advantage of the node-pruning procedure over classical feature selection methods is that the node-pruning procedure can simultaneously \"optimize\" both the feature set and the classifier, while classical feature selection methods select the \"best\" subset of features with respect to a fixed classifier."

Each of these models is characterized by a set of neighbors, a set of coefficients, and a noise sequence of specified characteristics. We are concerned with two problems: the estimation of the unknown parameters in both SAR and CM models and the choice of an appropriate model from a class of such competing models. Assuming Gaussian-distributed variables, we discuss maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods. In general, the ML scheme leads to nonlinear optimization problems. To avoid excessive computation, an iterative scheme is given for SAR models, which gives approximate ML estimates in the Gaussian case and reasonably good estimates in some non-Gaussian situations as well. Likewise, for CM models, an easily computable consistent estimate is given. The asymptotic mean-squared error (mse) of this estimate for a four-neighbor CM model is shown tn be substantially less than the mse of the popular coding estimate. Asymptotically consistent decision rules are given for choosing an appropriate SAR or CM model. The usefulness of the estimation scheme and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors is illustrated by using synthetic patterns. Synthetic patterns obeying known SAR and CM models are generated, and the models corresponding to true and several competing neighbor sets are fitted. The estimation scheme yields estimates close to the parameters of the true models, and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors picks up the true model from the class of competing models."

These transforms are conjoint spatial/spectral representations, which provide a complete image description in terms of locally windowed 2-D spectral coordinates embedded within global 2-D spatial coordinates. In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"
