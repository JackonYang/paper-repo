Then, the acquired data can be applied for mining methods requiring structured input data, in contrast to other text mining methods that utilize a bag-of-words approach. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach for structured data acquisition using a rule-based information extraction system. We propose a semi-automatic process model that includes the TEXTMARKER system for information extraction and data acquisition from textual documents. TEXTMARKER applies simple rules for extracting blocks from a given (semi-structured) document, which can be further analyzed using domain-specific rules. Thus, both low-level and higher-level information extraction is supported. We demonstrate the applicability and benefit of the approach with two case studies of two realworld applications."

However, state-of-the-art Open IE systems such as ReVerb and woe share two important weaknesses -- (1) they extract only relations that are mediated by verbs, and (2) they ignore context, thus extracting tuples that are not asserted as factual. This paper presents ollie, a substantially improved Open IE system that addresses both these limitations. First, ollie achieves high yield by extracting relations mediated by nouns, adjectives, and more. Second, a context-analysis step increases precision by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions. ollie obtains 2.7 times the area under precision-yield curve (AUC) compared to ReVerb and 1.9 times the AUC of woeparse."

Information Extraction (IE) techniques identify such structured information in text. In recent years, database research has pursued IE on two fronts: declarative languages and systems for managing IE tasks, and probabilistic databases for querying the output of IE. In this paper, we make the first step to merge these two directions, without loss of statistical robustness, by implementing a state-of-the-art statistical IE model - Conditional Random Fields (CRF) - in the setting of a Probabilistic Database that treats statistical models as first-class data objects. We show that the Viterbi algorithm for CRF inference can be specified declaratively in recursive SQL. We also show the performance benefits relative to a standalone open-source Viterbi implementation. This work opens up the optimization opportunities for queries involving both inference and relational operators over IE models."

In this paper, we describe SystemT, a rule-based IE system whose basic design removes the expressivity and performance limitations of current systems based on cascading grammars. SystemT uses a declarative rule language, AQL, and an optimizer that generates high-performance algebraic execution plans for AQL rules. We compare SystemT's approach against cascading grammars, both theoretically and with a thorough experimental evaluation. Our results show that SystemT can deliver result quality comparable to the state-of-the-art and an order of magnitude higher annotation throughput."

This structured data is increasingly exposed using information extraction systems, which generate structured relations from documents, introducing an opportunity to process expressive, structured queries over text databases. This paper discusses our SQoUT1 project, which focuses on processing structured queries over relations extracted from text databases. We show how, in our extraction-based scenario, query processing can be decomposed into a sequence of basic steps: retrieving relevant text documents, extracting relations from the documents, and joining extracted relations for queries involving multiple relations. Each of these steps presents different alternatives and together they form a rich space of possible query execution strategies. We identify execution efficiency and output quality as the two critical properties of a query execution, and argue that an optimization approach needs to consider both properties. To this end, we take into account the userspecified requirements for execution efficiency and output quality, and choose an execution strategy for each query based on a principled, cost-based comparison of the alternative execution strategies."

First, compared to current ad-hoc composition using, e.g., Perl or C++, Datalog provides a cleaner and more powerful way to compose small extraction modules into larger programs. Thus, writing IE programs this way retains and enhances the important advantages of current approaches: programs are easy to understand, debug, and modify. Second, once we write IE programs in this framework, we can apply query optimization techniques to them. This gives programs that, when run over a variety of data sets, are more efficient than any monolithic program because they are optimized based on the statistics of the data on which they are invoked. We show how optimizing such programs raises challenges specific to text data that cannot be accommodated in the current relational optimization framework, then provide initial solutions. Extensive experiments over real-world data demonstrate that optimization is indeed vital for IE programs and that we can effectively optimize IE programs written in this proposed framework."

URES is a Web relation extraction system that learns powerful extraction patterns from unlabeled text, using short descriptions of the target relations and their attributes. The performance of URES is further enhanced by classifying its output instances using the properties of the extracted patterns. The features we use for classification and the trained classification model are independent from the target relation, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments. In this paper we show how the introduction of a simple rule based NER can boost the performance of URES on a variety of relations. We also compare the performance of URES to the performance of the state-of-the-art KnowItAll system, and to the performance of its pattern learning component, which uses a simpler and less powerful pattern language than URES."

Information extraction from short listing titles present a unique challenge, with the lack of informative context and grammatical structure. In this work, we combine supervised NER with bootstrapping to expand the seed list, and output normalized results. Focusing on listings from eBay's clothing and shoes categories, our bootstrapped NER system is able to identify new brands corresponding to spelling variants and typographical errors of the known brands, as well as identifying novel brands. Among the top 300 new brands predicted, our system achieves 90.33% precision. To output normalized attribute values, we explore several string comparison algorithms and found n-gram substring matching to work well in practice."

In this paper, we develop a foundational framework where the central construct is what we call a spanner. A spanner maps an input string into relations over the spans (intervals specified by bounding indices) of the string. The focus of this paper is on the representation of spanners. Conceptually, there are two kinds of such representations. Spanners defined in a primitive representation extract relations directly from the input string; those defined in an algebra apply algebraic operations to the primitively represented spanners. This framework is driven by SystemT, an IBM commercial product for text analysis, where the primitive representation is that of regular expressions with capture variables.\n We define additional types of primitive spanner representations by means of two kinds of automata that assign spans to variables. We prove that the first kind has the same expressive power as regular expressions with capture variables; the second kind expresses precisely the algebra of the regular spanners---the closure of the first kind under standard relational operators. The core spanners extend the regular ones by string-equality selection (an extension used in SystemT). We give some fundamental results on the expressiveness of regular and core spanners. As an example, we prove that regular spanners are closed under difference (and complement), but core spanners are not. Finally, we establish connections with related notions in the literature."

Because PASs represent generalized structures for syntactical variants, patterns on PASs are expected to be more generalized than those on surface words. In addition, patterns are divided into components to improve recall and we introduce a Support Vector Machine to learn a prediction model using pattern matching results. In this paper, we present experimental results and analyze them on how well protein-protein interactions were extracted from MEDLINE abstracts. The results demonstrated that our method improved accuracy compared to a machine learning approach using surface word/part-of-speech patterns."

In this paper, we provide an empirical study on the impact of training data size and domain information on the performance stability of named entity recognition models. We present an informative sample selection method for building high quality and stable named entity recognition models across domains. Experimental results show that the performance of the named entity recognition model is enhanced significantly after being trained with these informative samples."

Concretely, we propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to topic models, each which generates a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them. The output of each model is a clustering of observed relation tuples and their associated textual expressions to underlying semantic relation types. Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions. We examine effectiveness of our approach via multiple evaluations and demonstrate 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline."

                "text": "Question classification is an important step in factual question answering (QA) and other dialog systems. Several attempts have been made to apply statistical machine learning approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with sophisticated features and kernels. Curiously, the payoff beyond a simple bag-of-words representation has been small. We show that most questions reveal their class through a short contiguous token subsequence, which we call its informer span. Perfect knowledge of informer spans can enhance accuracy from 79.4% to 88% using linear SVMs on standard benchmarks. In contrast, standard heuristics based on shallow pattern-matching give only a 3% improvement, showing that the notion of an informer is non-trivial. Using a novel multi-resolution encoding of the question's parse tree, we induce a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to identify informer spans with about 85% accuracy. Then we build a meta-classifier using a linear SVM on the CRF output, enhancing accuracy to 86.2%, which is better than all published numbers."

From this perspective, there exist glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to increase the impact that ML has? We present six Impact Challenges to explicitly focus the field's energy and attention, and we discuss existing obstacles that must be addressed. We aim to inspire ongoing discussion and focus on ML that matters."

We represent the problem of learning individual conjunctive clauses or individual disjunctive clauses as a Boolean group testing problem, and apply a novel linear programming relaxation to find solutions. We derive results for exact rule recovery which parallel the conditions for exact recovery of sparse signals in the compressed sensing literature: although the general rule recovery problem is NP-hard, under some conditions on the Boolean 'sensing' matrix, the rule can be recovered exactly. This is an exciting development in rule learning where most prior work focused on heuristic solutions. Furthermore we construct rule sets from these learned clauses using set covering and boosting. We show competitive classification accuracy using the proposed approach."
