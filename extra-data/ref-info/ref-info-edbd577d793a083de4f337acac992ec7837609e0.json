The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"
