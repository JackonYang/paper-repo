                "text": "In this second part of the paper the Wigner distribution is adapted to the case of discrete-time signals. It is shown that most of the properties of this time-frequency signal representation carry over directly to the discrete-time case, but some.others cause problems. These problems are associated with the fact that in general the Wigner distribution of a discrete-time signal contains aliasing contributions. It is indicated that these aliasing components will not be present if the signal is either oversampled by a factor of at least two, or is analytic. 1. Introduetion In part I of this paper 1) the Wigner distribution (WD) of continuous-time signals was discussed, and it was shown that this function has some very interesting properties. The determination of this distribution function requires, like the spectrum, an integral of the Fourier type to be evaluated. Ideally this requires the signal to be known for all. time, but in practice windowing techniques can be used to relax this requirement. The effects of windowing on the WD were discussed in part 1. In general two different approaches can be distinguished to compute these Fourier-type integrals. The first is by means of analogue signal processing, and recently optical signal processing methods have been proposed for determining suitable approximations to the WD 2). The second approach is based on digital signal processing. This opens the way to apply computationally efficient methods for evaluating the discrete Fourier transform, but requires the concept of the Wigner distribution to be transferred to the case of discretetime signals. This is the aim of this part of the paper. As can be expected, the WD for discrete-time signals shows much similarity with that for continuous-time signals, but in some respects it has characteristic differences. To emphasize the similarities and point out the differences we will try to follow as closely as possible the same lines as in part I, and give comments only on those results that differ from that of the continuous-time counterpart. 276 Phillps Journalof Research Vol.35 Nos.4/5 1980 Philips Journalof Research Vol.35 Nos.4/5 1980 277 The Wigner distribution Also the numbering of the equations is made such that corresponding equations have the same number. This has the consequence that sometimes equation numbers are not successive if equations have been deleted, and that equations that do not occur in part I have a special numbering. If reference is made to an equation in part I the equation is given the prefix I. All sections, except sec. 7, have the same topic and heading as in part I. Section 7, which in part I deals with the WD of band-limited signals, now deals with the WD of finite duration sequences. Equations in this section do not correspond in general with an equation of part I. 2. The Wigner distribution for discrete-time signals 2.1 Preliminaries In this paper Weconsider in general complex valued, discrete-time signals f(n), feC, n e Z for which the (Fourier) spectrum is defined by 3) 00 F(e) = (fJdf) (e) = L f(n) e -jnlJ.

Norms and Parseval's relation are then the same as in eqs (1.2.3) and (1.2.4) respectively. The following operators will be used.

What one would like with such a definition is (1) to obtain a simple concept; (2) to retain as many as possible of the properties of the WD of continuoustime signals; (3) to find a simple relation between the discrete-time and continuous-time WD's for discrete-time signals that are obtained by sampling of analogue signals. The definition which, in our opinion, best matches these requirements is the one suggested by eq. (1.7.10). 2.2. Definition of the Wigner distribution The cross-Wigner distribution of two discrete-time signals f(n) and g(n) is defined by 00 u-j,g(n, 0) = 2 L e-i2kDf(n + k)g*(n kl. (2.10) k=-oo The autoWigner distribution of a signal is then given by 00 u-j(n, 0) = Wj,f(n, 0) = 2 L e-i2kDf(n+k)f*(n kl. (2.11) k=-oo Both functions will be called a Wigner distribution (WD). Aiming at obtaining a relation similar to (1.2.13) the WD for the spectra must be defined by 278 Philips Journalor Research Vol.35 Nos.4/5 1980 The Wigner distribution so that 11 wF,G(e, n)= ~ J et; F(e + C) G*(e C) dc (2.12)"

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

It is shown that the complex spectrogram is completely determined by its values on the points of a certain time-frequency lattice. This lattice is exactly the one suggested by Gabor in 1946; it arose in connection with Gabor's sugges-tion to expand a signal into a discrete set of Gaussian elementary signals. Such an expansion is a special case of the more general expansion of a signal into a discrete set of properly shifted and modulated window functions. It is shown that this expansion exists. Furthermore, a set of functions is constructed, which is bi-orthonormal to the set of shifted and modulated window functions. With the help of this bi-orthonormal set of functions, the expansion coefficients can be determined easily."

                "text": "Morlet et al (1982, this issue) showed the advantages of using complex values for both waves and characteristics of the media. We simulated the theoretical tools we present here, using the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm. Now we present sampling methods for complex signals or traces corresponding to received waves, and sampling methods for complex characterization of multilayered or heterogeneous media. Regarding the complex signals, we present a twodimecsional(2-D) method of sampling in the time-frequency domain using a special or \u201cextended\u201d Gabor expansion on a set of basic wavelets adapted to phase preservation. Such a 2-D expansion permits us to handle in a proper manner instantaneous frequency spectra. We show the differences between \u201cwavelet resolution\u201d and \u201csampling grid resolution.\u201d We also show the importance of phase preservation in high-resolution seismic. Regarding the media, we show how analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structured layers could help when trying to characterize the physical properties of the layers and their large scale granularity as a result of complex deconvolution. Analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structures are well known in solid state physics, and lead to the so-called \u201cBloch waves.\u201d The introduction of complex waves leads to replacing the classical wave equation by a Schriidinger equation. Finally, we show that complex wave equations, Gabor expansion, and Bloch waves are three different ways of \u2018introducing the tools of quantum mechanics in highresolution seismic (Gabor, 1946; Kittel, 1976, Morlet, 1975). And conversely, the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm and an extended Gabor expansion may be of some use in solid state physics."

From the complex spectrogram the signal can be reconstructed uniquely. It is shown that the complex spectrogram is completely determined by its values on the points (to=mT, wo=n\u03a9), where \u03a9T= 2tt and m and n take all integer values. The lattice of points (mT,n\u03a9) is exactly the lattice suggested by Gabor as early as 1946; it arose in connection with Gabor's suggestion to expand a signal into a discrete set of Gaussian elementary signals. Such an expansion is a special case of the general expansion \u2211\u2211mn amng(t-mT)exp[in\u03a9t] of a signal into a discrete set of shifted and modulated window functions. It is shown that this expansion exists. Furthermore, a set of functions is constructed, which is bi-orthonormal to the set of shifted and modulated window functions. With the help of this bi-orthonormal set of functions, the expansion coefficients amn can be determined easily."

Roughly speaking, the result is true for the best choice of the \u03d5 i (prolate spheroidal wave functions), but not for sampling functions (of the form sin t/t). Some typical conclusions are: Let f(t), of total energy 1, be band-limited to bandwidth W, and let $\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\vert f^{2}(t)\\vert dt = 1- \\epsilon_{T}^{2}$ . Then ${\\rm inf}\\limits_{\\{a_{i}\\}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left\\vert f(t)- \\sum_{0}^{[2WT]+N]} a_{n}\\varphi_{n}\\right\\vert^{2} dt \\lt C_{\\epsilon_{T}^{2}}$ is (a) true for all such f with N = 0, C = 12, if the \u03d5 n are the prolate spheroidal wave functions; (b) false for some such f for any finite constants N and C if the \u03d5 n are sampling functions."

This group-representation theoretic approach allows us to analyze the radar ambi- guity functions simultaneously in time and frequency. Moreover, it allows us to determine the group of all transformations that leave the radar ambiguity surfaces invariant and to specify all admissible envelope functions that belong to radar signals of the same finite energy. In particular, an investigation of the radial, i.e., S0(2, R)-invariant radar ambiguity surfaces, gives rise to an identity for Laguerre-Weber functions of different orders, which implies on its part an identity for holomorphic theta series. 1. The basic group that stands at the crossroads of quantum mechanics and radar analysis is the real Heisenberg nilpotent group A(R). Indeed, the connected, simply connected two-step nilpotent Lie group A(R) forms the group-theoretic embodiment of the Heisenberg canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics (whence its name) which read at the Lie algebra level as follows:"

To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra. (auth)"

In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum- mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of themore\u00a0\u00bb incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related propenties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation. (auth)\u00ab\u00a0less"

Such systems are especially troublesome in the usual quantization approach since, as is well known from von Neumann's work, the relation [P, Q] = \u2212iI implies that P and Q must have a spectrum from \u2212 \u221e to \u221e if they are to be self\u2010adjoint. Consequently, if the spectrum of either P or Q is restricted, at least one of the operators, say Q, is not self\u2010adjoint and does not have a spectral resolution. Thus Q cannot generate a coordinate representation. This leads us to consider a different pair of operators, P and B, both of which are self\u2010adjoint and which obey [P, B] = \u2212iP. The Lie group corresponding to this latter algebra is the affine group, which has two unitarily inequivalent, irreducible representations, one in which the spectrum of P is positive. Using the affine group as our ki..."

The new representation is used for describing the motion of a Bloch electron in a magnetic and in an electric field. For the first problem, well-known results are reproduced in an extremely simple and natural way. It is also shown that the representation introduced in this paper gives a straightforward way to compare classical and quantum dynamics for a Bloch electron in external magnetic and electric fields."

The method combines aspects of the semiclassical nature of vibrational motion and variational, ab initio techniques. Localized complex Gaussian wave functions, whose parameters are chosen according to classical phase space criteria are employed in standard numerical basis set diagonalization routines. The Gaussians are extremely convenient as regards construction of Hamiltonian matrix elements, computation of derived properties such as Franck\u2013Condon factors, and interpretation of results in terms of classical motion. The basis set is not tied to any zeroth order Hamiltonian and is readily adaptable to arbitrary smooth potentials of any dimension."

The expansion into ondelettes of a boson scalar field naturally leads to phase cell cluster expansions, a formalism already developed by the authors using other related bases. Adoption of ondelettes expansions into the phase cell program gives improvements of some extant results, and excises an early error.Ondelettes lend more elegance to the phase cell cluster expansion of \u03c634, and to us are a vindication of the fundamental nature of this approach.

It is also shown that TF theory agrees asymptotically, in a certain sense, with nonrelativistic quantum theory as the nuclear charge z tends to infinity. The von Weizsacker correction is shown to correct certain undesirable features of TF theory and to yield a theory in much better agreement with what is believed (but as yet unproved) to be the structure of real atoms. Many open problems in the theory are presented."
