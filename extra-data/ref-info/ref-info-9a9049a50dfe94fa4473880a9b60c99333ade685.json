We employ a large database of manually segmented images in order to learn an optimal affinity function between pairs of pixels. These pairwise affinities can then be used to cluster the pixels into visually coherent groups. Region cues are computed as the similarity in brightness, color, and texture between image patches. Boundary cues are incorporated by looking for the presence of an \"intervening contour\", a large gradient along a straight line connecting two pixels. We first use the dataset of human segmentations to individually optimize parameters of the patch and gradient features for brightness, color, and texture cues. We then quantitatively measure the power of different feature combinations by computing the precision and recall of classifiers trained using those features. The mutual information between the output of the classifiers and the same-segment indicator function provides an alternative evaluation technique that yields identical conclusions. As expected, the best classifier makes use of brightness, color, and texture features, in both patch and gradient forms. We find that for brightness, the gradient cue outperforms the patch similarity. In contrast, using color patch similarity yields better results than using color gradients. Texture is the most powerful of the three channels, with both patches and gradients carrying significant independent information. Interestingly, the proximity of the two pixels does not add any information beyond that provided by the similarity cues. We also find that the convexity assumptions made by the intervening contour approach are supported by the ecological statistics of the dataset."

The approach is different from bottom-up segmentation methods that primarily use the continuity of grey-level, texture, and bounding contours. We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

A probabilistic formulation of contours demands a prior model and a measurement model. From the image statistics of boundary contours, we derive both the prior model of contour shape and the local likelihood model of image measurements. We observe multi-scale phenomena in the data, and accordingly propose a higher-order Markov model over scales for the contour continuity prior. Various image cues derived from orientation energy are evaluated and incorporated into the measurement model. Based on these models, we have designed a multi-scale algorithm for contour completion, which exploits both contour continuity and texture. Experimental results are shown on a wide range of images."

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images. >"

By transforming the region energy into a boundary energy, we can treat both contributions on an equal footing, and solve the global optimization problem as a minimum mean weight cycle problem on a directed graph. The simple, polynomial-time algorithm requires no initialization and is highly parallelizable."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

                "text": "This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper."

                "text": "Abstract : This reprint will introduce and study the most basic properties of three new variational problems which are suggested by applications to computer vision. In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper."

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily couple the two processes into one. A part-based object recognition system detects parts, supplies their partial segmentations and an evaluation of how well possible labellings on these parts go together based on the statistics of object spatial configurations. We integrate the top-level part grouping into the low-level pixel grouping based on feature similarity to segregate objects of interest from the background. We demonstrate that object part consistency and image pixel coherence can work together to eliminate local false positives and labelling ambiguities at high level, while at the same time overcome occlusion and weak contours at low level."

Previous studies of arsenic exposure in the blackfoot disease endemic area have been focused on malignant tumors. We, therefore, conducted this study to analyze mortality of all death causes in blackfoot disease endemic areas and to determine other neglected cancers or noncancer diseases related to artesian well water containing high levels of arsenic. We calculated standardized mortality ratios for cancer and noncancer diseases, by sex, during the period from 1971 to 1994 and compared them to the local reference group (i.e, Chiayi-Tainan County) and the national reference group (i.e., Taiwan population). The results revealed marked standardized mortality ratio differences for the 2 reference groups. Greater mortality was found for males and females with bladder, kidney, skin, lung, nasal-cavity, bone, liver, larynx, colon, and stomach cancers, as well as lymphoma than in the local reference population. With respect to noncancer diseases, we found greater mortality for males and females who had vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and bronchitis than in the local reference group. Mortalities for other diseases--including rectal cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and other diseases--were higher among cases than the local reference group. Our results indicated that the hazardous effect of arsenic is systemic. Diseases related to arsenic exposure included those reported previously by other investigators, as well as diseases reported in the present study."

Wells with and without present arsenic contamination were identified, and we interviewed and examined 1595 subjects who were depending on drinking water from these wells for living, all >/=30 years of age. The interview was based on a questionnaire, and arsenic exposure was estimated from the history of well-water consumption and current arsenic levels. Of the 1595 subjects studied, 1481 had a history of arsenic-contaminated drinking water, whereas 114 had not. Time-weighted mean arsenic levels (in milligrams per liter) and milligram-years per liter of arsenic exposure were estimated for each subject. Exposure categories were assessed as <0.5 mg/L, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and >1.0 mg/L and alternatively as <1.0 mg-y/L, 1.0 to 5.0 mg-y/L, >5.0 but </=10.0 mg-y/L, and >10.0 mg-y/L, respectively. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of >/=140 mm Hg in combination with a diastolic blood pressure of >/=90 mm Hg. Corresponding to the exposure categories, and using \"unexposed\" as the reference, the prevalence ratios for hypertension adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index were 1.2, 2.2, 2.5 and 0.8, 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, in relation to arsenic exposure in milligrams per liter and milligram-years per liter, respectively. The indicated dose-response relationships were significant (P<<0.001) for both series of risk estimates. These results suggest that arsenic exposure may induce hypertension in humans."

The status of diabetes mellitus was determined by an oral glucose tolerance test and a history of diabetes regularly treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. The cumulative arsenic exposure in parts per million-years was calculated from the detailed history of residential addresses and duration of drinking artesian well water obtained through standardized interviews based on a structured questionnaire and the arsenic concentration in well water. The body mass index was derived from body height and weight measured according to a standard protocol, while the physical activity at work was also obtained by questionnaire interviews. Residents in villages where the chronic arseniasis was hyperendemic had a twofold increase in age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of diabetes mellitus compared with residents in Taipei City and the Taiwan area. There was a dose-response relation between cumulative arsenic exposure and prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The relation remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and activity level at work by a multiple logistic regression analysis giving a multivariate-adjusted odds ratio of 6.61 and 10.05, respectively, for those who had a cumulative arsenic exposure of 0.1-15.0 and greater than 15.0 ppm-year compared with those who were unexposed. These results suggest the chronic arsenic exposure may induce diabetes mellitus in humans."

                "text": "This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper."

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily couple the two processes into one. A part-based object recognition system detects parts, supplies their partial segmentations and an evaluation of how well possible labellings on these parts go together based on the statistics of object spatial configurations. We integrate the top-level part grouping into the low-level pixel grouping based on feature similarity to segregate objects of interest from the background. We demonstrate that object part consistency and image pixel coherence can work together to eliminate local false positives and labelling ambiguities at high level, while at the same time overcome occlusion and weak contours at low level."

Women volunteers observed and recorded all water collection activities of each group of households using a handpump over a 2-day period. Data from questionnaire surveys on household characteristics were related to per capita use of water. The mean household water consumption rate was 43 l per capita per day. Univariate analyses showed that several factors were significantly associated with water consumption, including family size and age structure, occupation, distance from the house to the handpump, the number of people served by a handpump, and possession of luxury items. Multiple regression analysis showed that several factors remained associated with per capita consumption, although their predictive value was low. The method of measuring water consumption, and the policy implications of the findings, are discussed."

These diseases were selected because they are widespread and illustrate the variety of mechanisms through which improved water and sanitation can protect people. Disease-specific median reduction levels were calculated for all studies, and separately for the more methodologically rigorous ones. For the latter studies, the median reduction in morbidity for diarrhoea, trachoma, and ascariasis induced by water supplies and/or sanitation was 26%, 27%, and 29%, respectively; the median reduction for schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis was higher, at 77% and 78%, respectively. All studies of hookworm infection were flawed apart from one, which reported a 4% reduction in incidence. For hookworm infection, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis, the reduction in disease severity, as measured in egg counts, was greater than that in incidence or prevalence. Child mortality fell by 55%, which suggests that water and sanitation have a substantial impact on child survival. Water for personal and domestic hygiene was important in reducing the rates of ascariasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Sanitation facilities decreased diarrhoea morbidity and mortality and the severity of hookworm infection. Better water quality reduced the incidence of dracunculiasis, but its role in diarrhoeal disease control was less important than that of sanitation and hygiene."

                "text": "Many interventions have been advocated to mitigate the impact of arsenic contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh. However, there are few data on the true magnitude of arsenic-related disease in Bangladesh nationally. There has also been little consideration given to possible adverse effects of such interventions, in particular, diarrheal disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the likely impacts of arsenic mitigation interventions on both arsenic-related disease and water-borne infectious disease. We found that arsenic-related disease currently results in 9,136 deaths per year and 174,174 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; undiscounted) lost per year in those exposed to arsenic concentrations > 50 \u03bcg/L. This constitutes 0.3% of the total disease burden in Bangladesh in terms of undiscounted DALYs. We found intervention to be of overall benefit in reducing disease burden in most scenarios examined, but the concomitant increase in water-related infectious disease significantly reduced the potential benefits gained from intervention. A minimum reduction in arsenic-related DALYs of 77% was necessary before intervention achieved any reduction in net disease burden. This is assuming that interventions were provided to those exposed to > 50 \u03bcg/L and would concomitantly result in a 20% increase in water-related infectious disease in those without access to adequate sanitation. Intervention appears to be justified for those populations exposed to high levels of arsenic, but it must be based on exposure levels and on the effectiveness of interventions not only in reducing arsenic but in minimizing risk of water-related infections."

Women volunteers observed and recorded all water collection activities of each group of households using a handpump over a 2-day period. Data from questionnaire surveys on household characteristics were related to per capita use of water. The mean household water consumption rate was 43 l per capita per day. Univariate analyses showed that several factors were significantly associated with water consumption, including family size and age structure, occupation, distance from the house to the handpump, the number of people served by a handpump, and possession of luxury items. Multiple regression analysis showed that several factors remained associated with per capita consumption, although their predictive value was low. The method of measuring water consumption, and the policy implications of the findings, are discussed."

These diseases were selected because they are widespread and illustrate the variety of mechanisms through which improved water and sanitation can protect people. Disease-specific median reduction levels were calculated for all studies, and separately for the more methodologically rigorous ones. For the latter studies, the median reduction in morbidity for diarrhoea, trachoma, and ascariasis induced by water supplies and/or sanitation was 26%, 27%, and 29%, respectively; the median reduction for schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis was higher, at 77% and 78%, respectively. All studies of hookworm infection were flawed apart from one, which reported a 4% reduction in incidence. For hookworm infection, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis, the reduction in disease severity, as measured in egg counts, was greater than that in incidence or prevalence. Child mortality fell by 55%, which suggests that water and sanitation have a substantial impact on child survival. Water for personal and domestic hygiene was important in reducing the rates of ascariasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Sanitation facilities decreased diarrhoea morbidity and mortality and the severity of hookworm infection. Better water quality reduced the incidence of dracunculiasis, but its role in diarrhoeal disease control was less important than that of sanitation and hygiene."

                "text": "Many interventions have been advocated to mitigate the impact of arsenic contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh. However, there are few data on the true magnitude of arsenic-related disease in Bangladesh nationally. There has also been little consideration given to possible adverse effects of such interventions, in particular, diarrheal disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the likely impacts of arsenic mitigation interventions on both arsenic-related disease and water-borne infectious disease. We found that arsenic-related disease currently results in 9,136 deaths per year and 174,174 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; undiscounted) lost per year in those exposed to arsenic concentrations > 50 \u03bcg/L. This constitutes 0.3% of the total disease burden in Bangladesh in terms of undiscounted DALYs. We found intervention to be of overall benefit in reducing disease burden in most scenarios examined, but the concomitant increase in water-related infectious disease significantly reduced the potential benefits gained from intervention. A minimum reduction in arsenic-related DALYs of 77% was necessary before intervention achieved any reduction in net disease burden. This is assuming that interventions were provided to those exposed to > 50 \u03bcg/L and would concomitantly result in a 20% increase in water-related infectious disease in those without access to adequate sanitation. Intervention appears to be justified for those populations exposed to high levels of arsenic, but it must be based on exposure levels and on the effectiveness of interventions not only in reducing arsenic but in minimizing risk of water-related infections."

Women volunteers observed and recorded all water collection activities of each group of households using a handpump over a 2-day period. Data from questionnaire surveys on household characteristics were related to per capita use of water. The mean household water consumption rate was 43 l per capita per day. Univariate analyses showed that several factors were significantly associated with water consumption, including family size and age structure, occupation, distance from the house to the handpump, the number of people served by a handpump, and possession of luxury items. Multiple regression analysis showed that several factors remained associated with per capita consumption, although their predictive value was low. The method of measuring water consumption, and the policy implications of the findings, are discussed."

These diseases were selected because they are widespread and illustrate the variety of mechanisms through which improved water and sanitation can protect people. Disease-specific median reduction levels were calculated for all studies, and separately for the more methodologically rigorous ones. For the latter studies, the median reduction in morbidity for diarrhoea, trachoma, and ascariasis induced by water supplies and/or sanitation was 26%, 27%, and 29%, respectively; the median reduction for schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis was higher, at 77% and 78%, respectively. All studies of hookworm infection were flawed apart from one, which reported a 4% reduction in incidence. For hookworm infection, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis, the reduction in disease severity, as measured in egg counts, was greater than that in incidence or prevalence. Child mortality fell by 55%, which suggests that water and sanitation have a substantial impact on child survival. Water for personal and domestic hygiene was important in reducing the rates of ascariasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Sanitation facilities decreased diarrhoea morbidity and mortality and the severity of hookworm infection. Better water quality reduced the incidence of dracunculiasis, but its role in diarrhoeal disease control was less important than that of sanitation and hygiene."

                "text": "Many interventions have been advocated to mitigate the impact of arsenic contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh. However, there are few data on the true magnitude of arsenic-related disease in Bangladesh nationally. There has also been little consideration given to possible adverse effects of such interventions, in particular, diarrheal disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the likely impacts of arsenic mitigation interventions on both arsenic-related disease and water-borne infectious disease. We found that arsenic-related disease currently results in 9,136 deaths per year and 174,174 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; undiscounted) lost per year in those exposed to arsenic concentrations > 50 \u03bcg/L. This constitutes 0.3% of the total disease burden in Bangladesh in terms of undiscounted DALYs. We found intervention to be of overall benefit in reducing disease burden in most scenarios examined, but the concomitant increase in water-related infectious disease significantly reduced the potential benefits gained from intervention. A minimum reduction in arsenic-related DALYs of 77% was necessary before intervention achieved any reduction in net disease burden. This is assuming that interventions were provided to those exposed to > 50 \u03bcg/L and would concomitantly result in a 20% increase in water-related infectious disease in those without access to adequate sanitation. Intervention appears to be justified for those populations exposed to high levels of arsenic, but it must be based on exposure levels and on the effectiveness of interventions not only in reducing arsenic but in minimizing risk of water-related infections."
