Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The authors start by formulating constraints on image motion to account for the possibility of multiple motions. This is achieved by exploiting the notions of weak continuity and robust statistics in the formulation of a minimization problem. The resulting objective function is non-convex. Traditional stochastic relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the task. A highly parallel incremental stochastic minimization algorithm is presented which has a number of advantages over previous approaches. The incremental nature of the scheme makes it dynamic and permits the detection of occlusion and disocclusion boundaries.<<ETX>>"

This framework can handle flow discontinuities at motion boundaries as well as flow multiplicities due to transparency of objects in a unified manner. The constraint equations are formulated by a composition of homogeneously parametrized differential operators on the space-time image. Fitting algorithms for the constraints which result in eigensystem analyses are described. To determine the number of flows, the authors use the margin energy, a measure of goodness of fit which is the difference between the first and the second lower eigenenergy of the eigensystem. They also hypothesize a criterion for multiplicity. The measure and the criterion are derived from the analogy of quantum mechanics. It is demonstrated that the margin energy can determine the transparency and discontinuities of the flow field as regions of more than one flow.<<ETX>>"
