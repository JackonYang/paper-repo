Unfortunately, the complexity of most existing search algorithms, such as k-d tree and R-tree, grows exponentially with dimension, making them impractical for dimensionality above 15. In nearly all applications, the closest point is of interest only if it lies within a user specified distance /spl epsiv/. We present a simple and practical algorithm to efficiently search for the nearest neighbor within Euclidean distance /spl epsiv/. Our algorithm uses a projection search technique along with a novel data structure to dramatically improve performance in high dimensions. A complexity analysis is presented which can help determine /spl epsiv/ in structured problems. Benchmarks clearly show the superiority of the proposed algorithm for high dimensional search problems frequently encountered in machine vision, such as real-time object recognition."

Unlike other methods, which search for viewpoint-invariant shape descriptors to use as indices, we use a learning method to model the smooth variation in appearance of local feature sets (LFS). Indexing from LFS effectively deals with the problems of occlusion and missing features. The indexing functions generated by the learning method are probability distributions describing the possible interpretations of each index value. During recognition, this information can be used to select the least ambiguous features for matching. A verification stage follows so that the final reliability and accuracy of the match is greater than that from indexing alone.

The nearest neighbor problem is: given a set of n points in d-dimensional space, $S\\subset E\\sp{d}$, and given a query point $q\\in E\\sp{d}$, find the point of S that minimizes the Euclidean distance to q. We assume that the d is a constant, independent of n. \nEfficient algorithms are known for computing nearest neighbors in low dimensional spaces. But, as dimension increases, the difficulty of solving the nearest neighbor problem, either in time or space, seems to grow extremely rapidly. We show, however, that if one is willing to consider approximate nearest neighbors rather than exact nearest neighbors, it is possible to achieve efficient asymptotic performance for both space and query time, irrespective of input distribution. \nWe also present several practical algorithms for performing nearest neighbor searching in high dimensions. These algorithms draw on data structures such as the k-d tree and the neighborhood graph. We give an empirical analysis of these algorithms in the context of vector quantization, which is a technique used in the compression of speech and images. Our results show that these algorithms attain massive reductions in the running time while suffering little loss in performance. \nFinally, we analyze the complexity of the k-d tree algorithm for the uniform distribution, taking into account the effect of the boundary. We thus provide a more accurate analysis for realistic instances in high dimensions, where boundary effects are significant."

In order to accelerate recognition considerably, the model groups can be arranged in an index space (hashed) offline such that feasible matches are found by indexing into this space. For the case of 2D images and 3D models consisting of point features, bounds on the space required for indexing and on the speedup that such indexing can achieve are demonstrated. It is proved that, even in the absence of image error, each model must be represented by a 2D surface in the index space. This places an unexpected lower bound on the space required to implement indexing and proves that no quantity is invariant for all projections of a model into the image. Theoretical bounds on the speedup achieved by indexing in the presence of image error are also determined, and an implementation of indexing for measuring this speedup empirically is presented. It is found that indexing can produce only a minimal speedup on its own. However, when accompanied by a grouping operation, indexing can provide significant speedups that grow exponentially with the number of features in the groups. >"

A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process has been developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered. Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not assume that it is possible to directly derive depth information from the image. Instead, the primary descriptive component is a process of perceptual organization, in which spatial relations are detected directly among two-dimensional image features. A basic requirement of the recognition process is that perceptual organization should accurately distinguish meaningful groupings from those which arise by accident of viewpoint or position. This requirement is used to derive a number of further constraints which must be satisfied by algorithms for perceptual grouping. A specific algorithm is presented for the problem of segmenting curves into natural descriptions. Methods are also presented for using the viewpoint-invariance properties of the perceptual groupings to infer three-dimensional relations directly from the image. The search process itself is described, both for covering the range of possible viewpoints and the range of possible objects. A method is presented for using evidential reasoning to combine information from multiple sources to determine the most efficient ordering for the search. This use of evidential reasoning allows a system to automatically improve its performance as it gains visual experience. In summary, spatial organization and recognition are shown to be a practical basis for current systems and to provide a promising path for further development of improved visual capabilities."

The approach uses two different types of primitives for matching: small surface patches, where differential properties can be reliably computed, and lines corresponding to depth or orientation discontinuities. These are represented by splashes and 3-D curves, respectively. It is shown how both of these primitives can be encoded by a set of super segments, consisting of connected linear segments. These super segments are entered into a table and provide the essential mechanism for fast retrieval and matching. The issues of robustness and stability of the features are addressed in detail. The acquisition of the 3-D models is performed automatically by computing splashes in highly structured areas of the objects and by using boundary and surface edges for the generation of 3-D curves. The authors present results with the current system (3-D object recognition based on super segments) and discuss further extensions. >"

These shape descriptors can be used to index quickly and efficiently into a large model base of curved planar objects, because their value is independent of pose and unaffected by perspective. Thus, recognition can proceed independent of calculating pose. Object curves are represented using conics, attached with a fitting technique that commutes with projection. This means that the pose of an object can be determined by backprojecting known conics. The authors show examples of recognition and pose determination using real image data.<<ETX>>"

To minimize recognition time, these techniques exploit prior knowledge to reduce the number of verifications (the most expensive and critical part of the algorithm) required during recognition. The approach utilizes statistical constraints generated by modeling the entire sensing process, resulting in more accurate constraints on matches. Hypotheses are pruned by a probabilistic algorithm which selects matches based on image evidence and prior statistical constraints. The reliability of the verification decision is increased by robust localization. The authors have implemented these techniques in a system for recognizing polyhedral objects in range images. The results demonstrate accurate recognition while greatly limiting the number of verifications performed.<<ETX>>"

The author extends current methods of parameter solving to handle objects with arbitrary curved surfaces and with any number of internal parameters representing articulation, variable dimensions, or surface deformations. Numerical stabilization methods are developed that take account of inherent inaccuracies in the image measurements and allow useful solutions to be determined even when there are fewer matches than unknown parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to always ensure convergence of the solution. These techniques allow model-based vision to be used for a much wider class of problems than was possible with previous methods. Their application is demonstrated for tracking the motion of curved, parameterized objects. >"
