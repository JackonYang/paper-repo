This paper describes automatic and semi-automatic procedures for extracting and organizing semantic feature information implicit in dictionary definitions. Two head-finding heuristics are described for locating the genus terms in noun and verb definitions. The assumption is that the genus term represents inherent features of the word it defines. The two heuristics have been used to process definitions of 40,000 nouns and 8,000 verbs, producing indexes in which each genus term is associated with the words it defined. The Sprout program interactively grows a taxonomic \"tree\" from any specified root feature by consulting the genus index. Its output is a tree in which all of the nodes have the root feature for at least one of their senses. The Filter program uses an inverted form of the genus index. Filtering begins with an initial filter file consisting of words that have a given feature (e.g. [+human]) in all of their senses. The program then locates, in the index, words whose genus terms all appear in the filter file. The output is a list of new words that have the given feature in all of their senses."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."
