The standard approach to tree similarity is the tree edit distance, which has successfully been applied in a wide range of applications. In terms of runtime, the state-of-the-art for the tree edit distance is the RTED algorithm, which is guaranteed to be fast independently of the tree shape. Unfortunately, this algorithm uses twice the memory of the other, slower algorithms. The memory is quadratic in the tree size and is a bottleneck for the tree edit distance computation."

Evaluating the tree edit distance for large XML trees is difficult: the best known algorithms have cubic runtime and quadratic space complexity, and, thus, do not scale. Our solution is TASM-postorder, a memory-efficient and scalable TASM algorithm. We prove an upper bound for the maximum subtree size for which the tree edit distance needs to be evaluated. The upper bound depends on the query and is independent of the document size and structure. A core problem is to efficiently prune subtrees that are above this size threshold. We develop an algorithm based on the prefix ring buffer that allows us to prune all subtrees above the threshold in a single postorder scan of the document. The size of the prefix ring buffer is linear in the threshold. As a result, the space complexity of TASM-postorder depends only on k and the query size, and the runtime of TASM-postorder is linear in the size of the document. Our experimental evaluation on large synthetic and real XML documents confirms our analytic results."

The key element of our solution is a novel algorithm for obliviously embedding tree-edit distance metrics into an L1 vector space while guaranteeing a (worst-case) upper bound of O(log2n log*n) on the distance distortion between any data trees with at most n nodes. We demonstrate how our embedding algorithm can be applied in conjunction with known random sketching techniques to (1) build a compact synopsis of a massive, streaming XML data tree that can be used as a concise surrogate for the full tree in approximate tree-edit distance computations; and (2) approximate the result of tree-edit-distance similarity joins over continuous XML document streams. Experimental results from an empirical study with both synthetic and real-life XML data trees validate our approach, demonstrating that the average-case behavior of our embedding techniques is much better than what would be predicted from our theoretical worst-case distortion bounds. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithmic results on low-distortion embeddings for tree-edit distance metrics, and on correlating (e.g., through similarity joins) XML data in the streaming model."

In this paper, we present a worstcase O(n)-time algorithm for this problem, improving the previous best O(n log n)time algorithm [6]. Our result requires a novel adaptive strategy for deciding how a dynamic program divides into subproblems (which is interesting in its own right), together with a deeper understanding of the previous algorithms for the problem. We also prove the optimality of our algorithm among the family of decomposition strategy algorithms\u2014which also includes the previous fastest algorithms\u2014by tightening the known lower bound of \u03a9(n log n) [4] to \u03a9(n), matching our algorithm\u2019s running time. Furthermore, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds of \u0398(nm(1+log n m )) when the two trees have different sizes m and n, where m < n."

Determining similarity using tree edit distance has been proven useful in a variety of application areas. While subtree similarity-search has been studied in the past, solutions required traversal of all of T, which poses a severe bottleneck in processing time, as T grows larger. This paper proposes the first index structure for subtree similarity-search, provided that the unit cost function is used. Extensive experimentation and comparison to previous work shows the huge improvement gained when using the proposed index structure and processing algorithm."

However, finding such a cost-minimal script is computationally hard, thus the only methods that scale are approximate ones. Various approximate solutions have been proposed recently. However, most of them still show quadratic or worse runtime complexity in the tree size and thus do not scale well either. The only solutions with log-linear runtime complexity use simple matching algorithms that only find corresponding subtrees as long as these subtrees are equal. Consequently, such solutions are not robust at all, since small changes in the leaves which occur frequently can make all subtrees that contain the changed leaves unequal and thus prevent the matching of large portions of the trees. This problem could be avoided by searching for similar instead of equal subtrees but current similarity approaches are too costly and thus also show quadratic complexity. Hence, currently no robust log-linear method exists. We propose the random walks similarity (RWS) measure which can be used to find similar subtrees rapidly. We use this measure to build the RWS-Diff algorithm that is able to compute an approximately cost-minimal edit script in log-linear time while having the robustness of a similarity-based approach. Our evaluation reveals that random walk similarity indeed increases edit script quality and robustness drastically while still maintaining a runtime comparable to simple matching approaches."

This work is motivated by the support for change control in the context of the Xyleme project that is investigating dynamic warehouses capable of storing massive volumes of XML data. Because of the context, our algorithm has to be very efficient in terms of speed and memory space even at the cost of some loss of quality. Also, it considers, besides insertions, deletions and updates (standard in diffs), a move operation on subtrees that is essential in the context of XML. Intuitively, our diff algorithm uses signatures to match (large) subtrees that were left unchanged between the old and new versions. Such exact matchings are then possibly propagated to ancestors and descendants to obtain more matchings. It also uses XML specific information such as ID attributes. We provide a performance analysis of the algorithm. We show that it runs in average in linear time vs. quadratic time for previous algorithms. We present experiments on synthetic data that confirm the analysis. Since this problem is NP-hard, the linear time is obtained by trading some quality. We present experiments (again on synthetic data) that show that the output of our algorithm is reasonably close to the optimal in terms of quality. Finally we present experiments on a small sample of XML pages found on the Web."

Since some semi-structured data (e.g., Latex) have a flexible grammar and since many XML documents lack an accompanying DTD or XSD, we focus on computing a syntactic repair via the edit distance. \n \nTo solve this problem, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm which takes cubic time. While this algorithm is not scalable, well-formed substrings of the data can be pruned to enable faster computation. Unfortunately, there are still cases where the dynamic program could be very expensive; hence, we give branch-and-bound algorithms based on various combinations of two heuristics, called MinCost and MaxBenefit, that trade off between accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of these algorithms on real data."

Hence, XML is likely to be the format through which data from multiple sources is integrated.In this paper we study the problem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. A challenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents might convey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure. Consequently approximate match in structure, in addition to, content has to be folded in the join operation. We quantify approximate match in structure and content using well defined notions of distance. For structure, we propose computationally inexpensive lower and upper bounds for the tree edit distance metric between two trees. We then show how the tree edit distance, and other metrics that quantify distance between trees, can be incorporated in a join framework. We introduce the notion of reference sets to facilitate this operation. Intuitively, a reference set consists of data elements used to project the data space. We characterize what constitutes a good choice of a reference set and we propose sampling based algorithms to identify them. This gives rise to a variety of algorithmic approaches for the problem, which we formulate and analyze. We demonstrate the practical utility of our solutions using large collections of real and synthetic XML data sets."

Yet in many cases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. Typically the matching must be approximate since the representations in the sources differ.\n We propose pq-grams to approximately match hierarchical data from autonomous sources and define the pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the fanout weighted tree edit distance. We prove that the pq-gram distance is a lower bound of the fanout weighted tree edit distance and give a normalization of the pq-gram distance for which the triangle inequality holds.

We present an efficient algorithm to compute differences between old and new versions of an SGML/XML document. The difference between the two versions can be considered to be an edit script that transforms one document tree into another. The proposed algorithm is based on a hybridization of bottom-up and top-down methods: The matching relationships between nodes in the two versions are produced in a bottom-up manner and then the top-down breadth-first search computes an edit script. Faster matching is achieved because the algorithm does not need to investigate the possible existence of matchings for all nodes. Furthermore, it can detect structurally meaningful changes such as the movement and copy of a subtree as well as simple changes to the node itself like insertion, deletion, and update."

In this paper, we review key results and our recent results on the tree edit distance problem and related problems. In particular, we review polynomial time exact algorithms and more efficient approximation algorithms for the edit distance problem for ordered trees, and approximation algorithms for the largest common sub-tree problem for unordered trees.

Traditionally, it has been shown that pattern matching by using the HTML DOM tree is more efficient than the simple string matching approach. Nonetheless, previous tree-based pattern matching methods have problems by assuming that all HTML tags have the same values, assigning the same weight to each node in HTML trees. This paper proposes an enhanced tree matching algorithm that improves the tree edit distance method by considering the characteristics of HTML features. We assign different values to different HTML tree nodes according to their weights for displaying the corresponding data objects in the browser. Pattern matching of HTML patterns is done by obtaining the maximum mapping values of two HTML trees that are constructed with weighted node values from HTML data objects. Experiments are done over several Web commerce sites to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HTML tree matching algorithm."

Major efforts have been made in order to provide efficient access to relevant information within this huge repository of data. Although several techniques have been developed to the problem of Web data extraction, their use is still not spread, mostly because of the need for high human intervention and the low quality of the extraction results.In this paper, we present a domain-oriented approach to Web data extraction and discuss its application to automatically extracting news from Web sites. Our approach is based on a highly efficient tree structure analysis that produces very effective results. We have tested our approach with several important Brazilian on-line news sites and achieved very precise results, correctly extracting 87.71% of the news in a set of 4088 pages distributed among 35 different sites."

Although there has been much work in the development of sequence databases and matching algorithms for sequences (for performing queries and analyzing similarity), the more complicated tree structure of glycans does not allow a direct implementation of such a database for glycans, and further, does not allow for the direct application of sequence alignment algorithms for performing searches or analyzing similarity. Therefore, we have utilized a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for solving the maximum common subtree of two trees to implement an accurate and efficient tool for finding and aligning maximally matching glycan trees. The KEGG Glycan database for glycan structures released recently incorporates our tree-structure alignment algorithm with various parameters to adapt to the needs of a variety of users. Because we use similarity scores as opposed to a distance metric, our methods are more readily used to display trees of higher similarity. We present the two methods developed for this purpose and illustrate its validity."

Since software systems are stored version by version, the edit script has to be computed from these versions, which is known as a complex task. Existing approaches usually compute edit scripts at the text granularity with only add line and delete line actions. However, inferring syntactic changes from such an edit script is hard. Since moving code is a frequent action performed when editing code, it should also be taken into account. In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing an algorithm computing edit scripts at the abstract syntax tree granularity including move actions. Our objective is to compute edit scripts that are short and close to the original developer intent. Our algorithm is implemented in a freely-available and extensible tool that has been intensively validated."

The tool, called Diff/TS, calculates, visualizes and classifies edit operations including \"moves'' that will change one revision into another by means of detailed tree structural analysis on source code. Such analysis tends to be time consuming and inflexible. We have extended a general tree comparison algorithm with heuristics driven control configurable for multiple programming languages and have achieved both processing speed and analysis precision needed for investigating large-scale software projects. The tool is capable of processing Python, Java, C and C++ projects. We present several applications including software \"archaeology'' on a widely known open source software project and automated \"phylogenetic'' malware classification based on control flows. These examples suggest that tree differencing is useful for measuring distance or dissimilarity between tree structured artifacts, and offer good precision tests of the method."

NIR is a conceptually appealing approach to IR, but is hard due to the need to measure distance/similarity between structures. We aim to move beyond the state of the art in measuring structure similarity for NIR. \n \nIn this paper, a novel tree similarity measurement dtwAcs is proposed in terms of a novel interpretation of trees as multi dimensional sequences. We calculate the distance between trees by the way of computing the distance between multi dimensional sequences, which is conducted by integrating the all common subsequences into the dynamic time warping method. Experimental result shows that dtwAcs outperforms the state of the art."

To analyze and compare these complex three-dimensional structures it is important to develop suitable methods. We review the so called tree-edit-distance known from theoretical computer science and use this distance to define dissimilarity measures for neuronal cells. This measure intrinsically respects the tree-shape. It compares only those parts of two dendritic trees that have similar position in the whole tree. Therefore it can be interpreted as a generalization of methods using vector valued measures. Moreover, we show that our new measure, together with cluster analysis, is a suitable method for analyzing three-dimensional shape of hippocampal and cortical cells."

The definition of a relevant similarity measure becomes then a crucial point. So far, the edit distance approach with a-priori fixed operation costs has been one of the most used to accomplish the task. In this paper, the application of a probabilistic learning model to both string and tree edit distances is proposed and is compared to a genetic algorithm cost fitting approach. The results show that both learning models outperform fixed-costs systems, and that the probabilistic approach is able to describe consistently the underlying melodic similarity model."

In particular, keyword search is insufficient when expressions in a document are not annotated with natural keywords or the user cannot describe her query with keywords. Retrieving documents by querying their mathematical content directly is very appealing in various domains such as education, digital libraries, engineering, patent documents, medical sciences, etc. Capturing the relevance of mathematical expressions also greatly enhances document classification in such domains. Unlike text retrieval, where keywords carry enough semantics to distinguish text documents and rank them, math symbols do not contain much semantic information on their own. In fact, mathematical expressions typically consist of few alphabetical symbols organized in rather complex structures. Hence, the structure of an expression, which describes the way such symbols are combined, should also be considered. Unfortunately, there is no standard testbed with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a mathematics retrieval algorithm. In this paper we study the fundamental and challenging problems in mathematics retrieval, that is how to capture the relevance of mathematical expressions, how to query them, and how to evaluate the results. We describe various search paradigms and propose retrieval systems accordingly. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and further compare them through an extensive empirical study."

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies."

Therefore, our system is focused on the rule and ontology modification for dynamically offering the adaptive services according to the changes of environments and situations using the F-logic. This paper also proposes a context-aware dynamic service-oriented system (CADSOS) architecture which consists of the multi-agent system and context broker using the OSGi framework and SDOR engine based OntoStudio. We consider the delay time of the service reconstruction and rule modification in the reasoning engine using the policy of the service management. The evaluation of the system shows evidence that our system enhances the service response time for reasoning and managing the adaptive services. We can apply the various systems of ubiquitous computing environments by effectively offering the dynamically services."
