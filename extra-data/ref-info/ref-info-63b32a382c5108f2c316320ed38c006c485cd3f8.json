Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

Numerous models have been proposed over the years and often address different special cases, such as pedestrian detection or upper body pose estimation in TV footage. This paper shows that such specialization may not be necessary, and proposes a generic approach based on the pictorial structures framework. We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using belief propagation. We demonstrate that such a model is equally suitable for both detection and pose estimation tasks, outperforming the state of the art on three recently proposed datasets."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

Because humans are highly articulated, the range of deformations they undergo makes this task extremely challenging. Previous methods have focused largely on heuristics or pairwise part models in approaching this problem. We propose a bottom-up parsing of increasingly more complete partial body masks guided by a parse tree. At each level of the parsing process, we evaluate the partial body masks directly via shape matching with exemplars, without regard to how the parses are formed. The body is evaluated as a whole, not the sum of its constituent parses, unlike previous approaches. Multiple image segmentations are included at each of the levels of the parsing, to augment existing parses or to introduce ones. Our method yields both a pose estimate as well as a segmentation of the human. We demonstrate competitive results on this challenging task with relatively few training examples on a dataset of baseball players with wide pose variation. Our method is comparatively simple and could be easily extended to other objects."

To achieve tractability, the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example, by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions. These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data. On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars."

The method involves first localizing the spatial layout of the head, torso and limbs in individual frames using pictorial structures, and associating these through a shot by tracking. A feature vector describing the pose is then constructed from the pictorial structure. Shots can be retrieved either by querying on a single frame with the desired pose, or through a pose classifier trained from a set of pose examples. Our main contribution is an effective system for retrieving people based on their pose, and in particular we propose and investigate several pose descriptors which are person, clothing, background and lighting independent. As a second contribution, we improve the performance over existing methods for localizing upper body layout on unconstrained video. We compare the spatial layout pose retrieval to a baseline method where poses are retrieved using a HOG descriptor. Performance is assessed on five episodes of the TV series 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', and pose retrieval is demonstrated also on three Hollywood movies.."

                "text": "Tree structured models have been widely used for determining the pose of a human body, from either 2D or 3D data. While such models can effectively represent the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure, they do not capture additional constraints such as coordination of the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss an important source of information about human body pose, as limb coordination is necessary for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being evident in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this paper, we consider the use of undirected graphical models that augment a tree structure with latent variables in order to account for coordination between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor models, since they are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional correlations in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree structure. These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure and thus a variant of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can be applied for efficient estimation. We present some experimental results contrasting common-factor models with tree models, and quantify the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data."

Typically, one fits a model by maximizing the likelihood of the part labels. Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector).

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

In this work we attempt to tackle this problem in a general setting. The dataset we use is a collection of sports news photographs of baseball players, varying dramatically in pose and clothing. The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures. We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted full body configurations."

We focus primarily on the case of star-structured models and show how a simple algorithm based on partial hypothesis pruning can speed up object detection by more than one order of magnitude without sacrificing detection accuracy. In our algorithm, partial hypotheses are pruned with a sequence of thresholds. In analogy to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, we introduce the notion of probably approximately admissible (PAA) thresholds. Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples. Finally, we outline a cascade detection algorithm for a general class of models defined by a grammar formalism. This class includes not only tree-structured pictorial structures but also richer models that can represent each part recursively as a mixture of other parts."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

We represent an exponentially large set of ltered outputs using max marginals and propose a novel convex loss function that balances ltering error with ltering eciency. We provide generalization bounds for these loss functions and evaluate our approach on handwriting recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

Syntactic parsers have huge grammars, machine translation systems have huge transfer tables, and so on across a range of tasks. With such complexity come two challenges. First, how can we learn highly complex models? Second, how can we efficiently infer optimal structures within them? \nHierarchical coarse-to-fine methods address both questions. Coarse-to-fine approaches exploit a sequence of models which introduce complexity gradually. At the top of the sequence is a trivial model in which learning and inference are both cheap. Each subsequent model refines the previous one, until a final, full-complexity model is reached. Because each refinement introduces only limited complexity, both learning and inference can be done in an incremental fashion. In this dissertation, we describe several coarse-to-fine systems. \nIn the domain of syntactic parsing, complexity is in the grammar. We present a latent variable approach which begins with an X-bar grammar and learns to iteratively refine grammar categories. For example, noun phrases might be split into subcategories for subjects and objects, singular and plural, and so on. This splitting process admits an efficient incremental inference scheme which reduces parsing times by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it produces the best parsing accuracies across an array of languages, in a fully language-general fashion. \nIn the domain of acoustic modeling for speech recognition, complexity is needed to model the rich phonetic properties of natural languages. Starting from a mono-phone model, we learn increasingly refined models that capture phone internal structures, as well as context-dependent variations in an automatic way. Our approaches reduces error rates compared to other baseline approaches, while streamlining the learning procedure. \nIn the domain of machine translation, complexity arises because there and too many target language word types. To manage this complexity, we translate into target language clusterings of increasing vocabulary size. This approach gives dramatic speed-ups while additionally increasing final translation quality."

In contrast to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images. We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale. As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity, providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this method."

We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications."

The formalism allows a rich set of parse-tree features, including PCFG-based features, bigram and trigram dependency features, and surface features. A severe challenge in applying such an approach to full syntactic parsing is the efficiency of the parsing algorithms involved. We show that efficient training is feasible, using a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) based parsing formalism. A lower-order dependency parsing model is used to restrict the search space of the full model, thereby making it efficient. Experiments on the Penn WSJ treebank show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, for both constituent and dependency accuracy."

                "text": "We describe and analyze a simple and effective stochastic sub-gradient descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem cast by Support Vector Machines (SVM). We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution of accuracy $${\\epsilon}$$ is $${\\tilde{O}(1 / \\epsilon)}$$, where each iteration operates on a single training example. In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods for SVMs require $${\\Omega(1 / \\epsilon^2)}$$ iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is $${\\tilde{O}(d/(\\lambda \\epsilon))}$$, where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM learning methods."
