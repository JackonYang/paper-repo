                "text": "The World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstructured documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. We extracted 14.1 billion HTML tables from Google's general-purpose web crawl, and used statistical classification techniques to find the estimated 154M that contain high-quality relational data. Because each relational table has its own \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, each such table can be considered a small structured database. The resulting corpus of databases is larger than any other corpus we are aware of, by at least five orders of magnitude. \n \nWe describe the WEBTABLES system to explore two fundamental questions about this collection of databases. First, what are effective techniques for searching for structured data at search-engine scales? Second, what additional power can be derived by analyzing such a huge corpus? \n \nFirst, we develop new techniques for keyword search over a corpus of tables, and show that they can achieve substantially higher relevance than solutions based on a traditional search engine. Second, we introduce a new object derived from the database corpus: the attribute correlation statistics database (AcsDB) that records corpus-wide statistics on co-occurrences of schema elements. In addition to improving search relevance, the AcsDB makes possible several novel applications: schema auto-complete, which helps a database designer to choose schema elements; attribute synonym finding, which automatically computes attribute synonym pairs for schema matching; and join-graph traversal, which allows a user to navigate between extracted schemas using automatically-generated join links."

For example, a collection of newspaper articles might contain information on the location of the headquarters of a number of organizations. If we need to nd the location of the headquarters of, say, Microsoft, we could try and use traditional information-retrieval techniques for nding documents that contain the answer to our query. Alternatively, we could answer such a query more precisely if we somehow had available a table listing all the organization-location pairs that are mentioned in our document collection. One could view the extraction process as automatically building a materialized view over the unstructured text data. In this demo we present an interactive prototype of our Snowball system for extracting relations from collections of plain-text documents with minimal human participation. Our method builds on the DIPRE idea introduced by Brin [3]. Our system and techniques were presented in detail in [2] and [1]."

We also argue that the visual cues embedded within the HTML text, are utilized by the authors to direct the viewer on how to read the contents contained a web table properly. We develop a framework for comprehensively analyzing the structural aspects of a web table, within which rules are devised to process and extract attribute-value pairs from the table.

In this paper, we approach the problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attention from the tree-based representation of webpages to a variation of the two-dimensional visual box model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. The there by obtained topological and style information allows us to fill the gap created by missing domain-specific knowledge about content and table templates.

In this paper, we consider the problem of table detection in web documents. Its potential applications include web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved."

Past solutions have proposed a principled combination of multiple algorithms. However, these solutions sometimes perform rather poorly due to the lack of sufficient evidence in the schemas being matched. In this paper we show how a corpus of schemas and mappings can be used to augment the evidence about the schemas being matched, so they can be matched better. Such a corpus typically contains multiple schemas that model similar concepts and hence enables us to learn variations in the elements and their properties. We exploit such a corpus in two ways. First, we increase the evidence about each element being matched by including evidence from similar elements in the corpus. Second, we learn statistics about elements and their relationships and use them to infer constraints that we use to prune candidate mappings. We also describe how to use known mappings to learn the importance of domain and generic constraints. We present experimental results that demonstrate corpus-based matching outperforms direct matching (without the benefit of a corpus) in multiple domains."

                "text": "This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for recognizing synonyms, based on statistical data acquired by querying a Web search engine. The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)."

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."
