The idea is to characterize a signal with a gradient vector derived from a generative probability model and to subsequently feed this representation to a discriminative classifier. We propose to apply this framework to image categorization where the input signals are images and where the underlying generative model is a visual vocabulary: a Gaussian mixture model which approximates the distribution of low-level features in images. We show that Fisher kernels can actually be understood as an extension of the popular bag-of-visterms. Our approach demonstrates excellent performance on two challenging databases: an in-house database of 19 object/scene categories and the recently released VOC 2006 database. It is also very practical: it has low computational needs both at training and test time and vocabularies trained on one set of categories can be applied to another set without any significant loss in performance."

The presented features are inspired by the SIFT keypoint descriptor, widely employed in computer vision and object recognition, but underexploited in the handwriting recognition field. In our approach, a sliding window moves from left to right over a word image. At each position, the window is subdivided into cells, and in each cell a histogram of orientations is accumulated. Experiments using two different word spotting systems hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping demonstrate a very significant improvement when using the proposed features with respect to the state-of-the-art ones."

The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel Gaussian DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g., speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

Score-space kernels are generalized Fisher kernels based on underlying generative models, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), which are output distributions of each state in HMMs. Our system combines the advantages of both generative and discriminative classifiers. In the first phase, HMMs are used for multi-classification, then SVMs are applied to resolve any uncertainty remaining after the first-pass HMM-based recognizer, but they are not applied for all classes because the results of some classes are worse. We consider the HMM confusion matrix to find the confused candidates in each class. If there is one candidate, it means there is no confusion in this class, and HMMs alone are sufficient to classify. SVMs are applied if there is more than one candidate. If there are more than two, the multi-class method is applied. On account of the basic score-spaces, likelihood and likelihood ratio score-spaces are not symmetrical. In the case of likelihood score-space, the parameters refer to only one generative model from two class models. In the case of likelihood ratio score-space, the parameters refer to both of them, but in different positions; thus one observation sequence can map to two score-vectors. We propose a new symmetric score-space, called symmetric likelihood ratio score-space. In this way, one observation sequence is mapped to only one score-vector. Experimental results show the average recognition rate improved from 89.9%, using baseline HMM, to 92.5%, using our proposed method."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

These methods learn classifiers that incorporate weighted sums of basis functions with sparsity-promoting priors encouraging the weight estimates to be either significantly large or exactly zero. From a learning-theoretic perspective, these methods control the capacity of the learned classifier by minimizing the number of basis functions used, resulting in better generalization. This paper presents three contributions related to learning sparse classifiers. First, we introduce a true multiclass formulation based on multinomial logistic regression. Second, by combining a bound optimization approach with a component-wise update procedure, we derive fast exact algorithms for learning sparse multiclass classifiers that scale favorably in both the number of training samples and the feature dimensionality, making them applicable even to large data sets in high-dimensional feature spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms to perform exact multinomial logistic regression with a sparsity-promoting prior. Third, we show how nontrivial generalization bounds can be derived for our classifier in the binary case. Experimental results on standard benchmark data sets attest to the accuracy, sparsity, and efficiency of the proposed methods."
