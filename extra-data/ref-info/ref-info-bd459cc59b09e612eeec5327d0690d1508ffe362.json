An example grammar is presented, and a sample parse is discussed at length to illustrate these mechanisms."

Dr Jackendoff has attempted to take a broader view of semantics, studying the important contribution it makes to the syntactic patterns of English.The research is carried out in the framework of an interpretive theory, that is, a theory of grammar in which syntactic structures are given interpretations by an autonomous syntactic component. The book investigates a wide variety of semantic rules, stating them in considerable detail and extensively treating their consequences for the syntactic component of the grammar. In particular, it is shown that the hypothesis that transformations do not change meaning must be abandoned; but equally stringent restrictions on transformations are formulated within the interpretive theory.Among the areas of grammar discussed are the well-known problems of case relations, pronominalization, negation, and quantifiers. In addition, the author presents semantic analyses of such neglected areas as adverbs and intonation contours; he also proposes radically new approaches to the so-called Crossover Principle, the control problem for complement subjects, parentheticals, and the interpretation of nonspecific noun phrases."

It is a theoretically oriented treatment of a practical subject. Our motivation for making it so is threefold. \n \n(1) In an area as rapidly changing as Computer Science, sound pedagogy demands that courses emphasize ideas, rather than implementation details. It is our hope that the algorithms and concepts presented in this book will survive the next generation of computers and programming languages, and that at least some of them will be applicable to fields other than compiler writing. \n \n(2) Compiler writing has progressed to the point where many portions of a compiler can be isolated and subjected to design optimization. It is important that appropriate mathematical tools be available to the person attempting this optimization. \n \n(3) Some of the most useful and most efficient compiler algorithms, e.g. LR(k) parsing, require a good deal of mathematical background for full understanding. We expect, therefore, that a good theoretical background will become essential for the compiler designer. \n \nWhile we have not omitted difficult theorems that are relevant to compiling, we have tried to make the book as readable as possible. Numerous examples are given, each based on a small grammar, rather than on the large grammars encountered in practice. It is hoped that these examples are sufficient to illustrate the basic ideas, even in cases where the theoretical developments are difficult to follow in isolation. \n \nFrom volume 2 Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nCompiler design is one of the first major areas of systems programming for which a strong theoretical foundation is becoming available. Volume I of The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling developed the relevant parts of mathematics and language theory for this foundation and developed the principal methods of fast syntactic analysis. Volume II is a continuation of Volume I, but except for Chapters 7 and 8 it is oriented towards the nonsyntactic aspects of compiler design. \n \nThe treatment of the material in Volume II is much the same as in Volume I, although proofs have become a little more sketchy. We have tried to make the discussion as readable as possible by providing numerous examples, each illustrating one or two concepts. \n \nSince the text emphasizes concepts rather than language or machine details, a programming laboratory should accompany a course based on this book, so that a student can develop some facility in applying the concepts discussed to practical problems. The programming exercises appearing at the ends of sections can be used as recommended projects in such a laboratory. Part of the laboratory course should discuss the code to be generated for such programming language constructs as recursion, parameter passing, subroutine linkages, array references, loops, and so forth."

These advantages have been gained by trading off syntactic variety for the rigidity of paren-thesized prefix notation. This paper describes an approach to increasing the available notational variety in LISP without compromising the above advantages of the standard notation. A primary advantage of the availability of such variety is the extent to which documentation can be incorporated into the code itself, decreasing the chance of mismatches between cods and documentation. The approach differs from that of MLISP , which attempts to be a self-contained language rather than a notation available immediately on demand to the ordinary LISP user. A striking feature of a MACLISP implementation of this approach, the CGOL notation, is that any LISP user, at any time, without any prior preparation, and without significant compromise of storage or speed, can in mid-stream change to the CGOL notation merely by typing (CGOL) at the LISP he is presently using, even if he has already loaded and begun running his LISP program. Another striking feature is the possibility of notational transparency; a LISP user may ask LISP to read a file without needing to know the notation(s) used within that file. Working Papers are intended for internal use only."

There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter \"Economic Reality\" has also been revised to reflect a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems."

They are insufficient for scheduling situations where the problem description is ill-defined, involving incomplete, possibly inconsistent and generally qualitative constraints. The NUDGE program uses an extensive knowledge base to debug scheduling requests by supplying typical values for qualitative constraints, supplying missing details and resolving minor inconsistencies. The result is that an informal request is converted to a complete description suitable for a traditional scheduler. \n \nTo implement the NUDGE program, a knowledge representation language-FRL-0- based on a few powerful generalizations of the traditional property list representation has been developed. The NUDGE knowledge base defined in FRL-0 consists of a hierarchical set of concepts that provide generic deseriptions of the typical activities, agents, plans and purposes of the domain to be scheduled. Currently, this domain is the management and coordination of personnel engaged in a group project. \n \nNUDGE constitutes an experiment in knowledge-based, rather than power-based AI programs. It also provides an example of an intelligent support system, in which an AI program serves as an aid to a decision maker. Finally, NUDGE has served an experimental vehicle for testing advanced representation techniques."
