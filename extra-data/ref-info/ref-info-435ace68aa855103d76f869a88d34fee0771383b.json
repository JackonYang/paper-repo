They can be viewed as generalizations of the Tomasi-Kanade algorithm from affine to fully perspective cameras, and from points to lines. They make no restrictive assumptions about scene or camera geometry, and unlike most existing reconstruction methods they do not rely on 'privileged' points or images. All of the available image data is used, and each feature in each image is treated uniformly. The key to projective factorization is the recovery of a consistent set of projective depths (scale factors) for the image points: this is done using fundamental matrices and epipoles estimated from the image data. We compare the performance of the new techniques with several existing ones, and also describe an approximate factorization method that gives similar results to SVD-based factorization, but runs much more quickly for large problems."

The main contribution is a deeper theoretical understanding of multiple view geometry for affine cameras. This is accomplished by carefully selecting a specific coordinate system, based on relative affine coordinates. One consequence of the choice of coordinates is that it is possible to directly read out the camera matrices as well as the object coordinates from the image measurements. The proposed method is well suited for tracking purposes as well as robust estimation schemes, like RANSAC, since only four basis points are needed. Furthermore, since no costly calculations are involved, the method is very fast. Experiments are carried out on both simulated and real data, showing its relative performance against factorization."

                "text": "Several vision problems can be reduced to the problem of fitting a linear surface of low dimension to data. These include determining affine structure from motion or from intensity images. These methods must deal with missing data; for example, in structure from motion, missing data will occur if some point features are not visible in the image throughout the motion sequence. Once data is missing, linear fitting becomes a nonlinear optimization problem. Techniques such as gradient descent require a good initial estimate of the solution to ensure convergence to the correct answer. We propose a novel method for fitting a low rank matrix to a matrix with missing elements. This method produces a good starting point for descent-type algorithms and can produce an accurate solution without further refinement. We then focus on applying this method to the problem of structure-from-motion. We show that our method has desirable theoretical properties compared to previously proposed methods, because it can find solutions when there is less data present. We also show experimentally that our method provides good results compared to previously proposed methods."

We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step.An image stream can be represented by the 2F\u00d7P measurement matrix of the image coordinates of P points tracked through F frames. We show that under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3.Based on this observation, the factorization method uses the singular-value decomposition technique to factor the measurement matrix into two matrices which represent object shape and camera rotation respectively. Two of the three translation components are computed in a preprocessing stage. The method can also handle and obtain a full solution from a partially filled-in measurement matrix that may result from occlusions or tracking failures.The method gives accurate results, and does not introduce smoothing in either shape or motion. We demonstrate this with a series of experiments on laboratory and outdoor image streams, with and without occlusions."

It is shown that a geometric image error can be minimized over all views by a simple three parameter numerical optimization. Then, that an algebraic image error can be minimized over all views by computing the solution to a cubic in one variable. Finally, a minor point, is that this \"quasi-linear\" linear solution enables a more concise algorithm, than any given previously, for the reconstruction of 6 points in 3 views. \n \nThe second contribution is an m view n \u2265 6 point robust reconstruction algorithm which uses the 6 point method as a search engine. This extends the successful RANSAC based algorithms for 2-views and 3-views to m views. The algorithm can cope with missing data and mismatched data and may be used as an efficient initializer for bundle adjustment. \n \nThe new algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and real image sequences, and compared to optimal estimation results (bundle adjustment)."

The reconstruction and camera recovery is achieved, in a single step, by finding the null-space of a matrix using singular value decomposition. Unlike factorization algorithms, the presented algorithm does not require all points to be visible in all views. By simultaneously reconstructing points and views the numerically stabilizing effect of having wide spread cameras with large mutual baselines is exploited. Experimental results are presented for both finite and infinite reference planes. An especially interesting application of this method is the reconstruction of architectural scenes with the reference plane taken as the plane at infinity which is visible via three orthogonal vanishing points. This is demonstrated by reconstructing the outside and inside (courtyard) of a building on the basis of 35 views in one single SVD."

In this paper, we formulate and propose solutions to a new family of reconstruction problems from multiple images with minimal data, where there are missing points in some of the images. The ability to handle the minimal cases with missing data is of great theoretical and practical importance. It is unavoidable to use them to bootstrap robust estimation such as RANSAC and LMS algorithms and optimal estimation such as bundle adjustment. First, we develop a framework to parametrize the multiple view geometry, needed to handle the missing data cases. Then we present a solution to the minimal case of 8 points in 3 images, where one of the points is missing in one of the three images. We prove that there are in general as many as 11 solutions for this minimal case. Furthermore, all minimal cases with missing data for 3 and 4 in images are catalogued. Finally we demonstrate the method on both simulated and real images and show that the algorithms presented in this paper can be used for practical problems."

All methods can incorporate both point, line and conic features in a unified manner. The correspondence between features in different images is assumed to be known.Three new tensor representations are introduced describing the viewing geometry for two and three cameras. The centred affine epipoles can be used to constrain the location of corresponding points and conics in two images. The third order, or alternatively, the reduced third order centred affine tensors can be used to constrain the locations of corresponding points, lines and conics in three images. The reduced third order tensors contain only 12 components compared to the 16 components obtained when reducing the trifocal tensor to affine cameras.A new factorization method is presented. The novelty lies in the ability to handle not only point features, but also line and conic features concurrently. Another complementary method based on the so-called closure constraints is also presented. The advantage of this method is the ability to handle missing data in a simple and uniform manner. Finally, experiments performed on both simulated and real data are given, including a comparison with other methods."

It has the advantage of simplicity of implementation. The prevailing view is, however, that it is extremely susceptible to noise and hence virtually useless for most purposes. The paper challenges that view, by showing that by preceding the algorithm with a very simple normalization (translation and scaling) of the coordinates of the matched points, results are obtained comparable with the best iterative algorithms. This improved performance is justified by theory and verified by extensive experiments on real images.<<ETX>>"

This factorization is only possible when the image points are correctly scaled. The major technical contribution of this paper is a practical method for the recovery of these scalings, using only fundamental matrices and epipoles estimated from the image data. The resulting projective reconstruction algorithm runs quickly and provides accurate reconstructions. Results are presented for simulated and real images."

The so-called structure-from-motion problem is to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections. For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration. Results of a numerical experiment are discussed."

This relationship is based on the parallax displacements of points with respect to an arbitrary planar surface, and does not involve epipolar geometry. A constraint is derived over two frames for any pair of points, relating their projective structure (with respect to the plane) based only on their image coordinates and their parallax displacements. Similarly, a 3D-rigidity constraint between pairs of points over multiple frames is derived. We show applications of these parallax-based constraints to solving three important problems in 3D scene analysis: (i) the recovery of 3D scene structure, (ii) the detection of moving objects in the presence of camera induced motion, and (iii) the synthesis of new camera views based on a given set of views. Moreover, we show that this approach can handle difficult situations for 3D scene analysis, e.g., where there is only a small set of parallax vectors, and in the presence of independently moving objects."
