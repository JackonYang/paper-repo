First, they provide a more robust representation in the face of grammatical and typographical errors in the documents. Secondly, N-gram representations require no linguistic preparations such as word-stemming or stopword removal. Thus they are ideal in situations requiring multi-language operations. Vector processing retrieval models also have some unique advantages for information retrieval tasks. In particular, they provide a simple, uniform representation for documents and queries, and an intuitively appealing document similarity measure. Also, modern vector space models have good retrieval performance characteristics. In this work, we combine these two ideas by using a vector processing model for documents and queries, but using N-gram frequencies as the basis for the vector element values instead of more traditional term frequencies. The resulting system provides good retrieval performance on the TREC-1 and TREC-2 tests without the need for any kind of word stemming or stopword removal. We also have begun testing the system on Spanish language documents."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy.

We first discuss the geometry of feature space. In particular, we review what is known about the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this influences the capacity of SV methods. Following this, we describe how the metric governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels, which are often used in SV pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space. We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications of kernel methods. First, we use it to reduce the computational complexity of SV decision functions; second, we combine it with the Kernel PCA algorithm, thereby constructing a nonlinear statistical denoising technique which is shown to perform well on real-world data."

In the feature space they then nd a maximal margin hyperplane which separates the data. This hyperplane is usually found using a quadratic programming routine which is computation-ally intensive, and is non trivial to implement. In this paper we propose an adaptation of the Adatron algorithm for clas-siication with kernels in high dimensional spaces. The algorithm is simple and can nd a solution very rapidly with an exponentially fast rate of convergence (in the number of iterations) towards the optimal solution. Experimental results with real and artiicial datasets are provided."

The basic idea is to find a hyperplane which separates the d-dimensional data perfectly into its two classes. However, since example data is often not linearly separable, SVM\u2019s introduce the notion of a \u201ckernel induced feature space\u201d which casts the data into a higher dimensional space where the data is separable. Typically, casting into such a space would cause problems computationally, and with overfitting. The key insight used in SVM\u2019s is that the higher-dimensional space doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with directly (as it turns out, only the formula for the dot-product in that space is needed), which eliminates the above concerns. Furthermore, the VC-dimension (a measure of a system\u2019s likelihood to perform well on unseen data) of SVM\u2019s can be explicitly calculated, unlike other learning methods like neural networks, for which there is no measure. Overall, SVM\u2019s are intuitive, theoretically wellfounded, and have shown to be practically successful. SVM\u2019s have also been extended to solve regression tasks (where the system is trained to output a numerical value, rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d classification)."

Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications. The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further study. Equally, the book and its associated web site will guide practitioners to updated literature, new applications, and on-line software."

As well as making explicit some of the details on SRM, it provides a result that allows one to trade off errors on the training sample against improved generalization performance. It then considers the more general case when the hierarchy of classes is chosen in response to the data. A result is presented on the generalization performance of classifiers with a \"large margin\". This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms of \"luckiness\" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets. Four examples are given of such functions, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (1971) dimension measured on the sample."

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

This paper builds on preliminary results presented obtained with this technique Lodhi et al. (2001). This is most likely due to the extreme computational cost of accessing such a feature space without using the kernel trick. For a given sequence length k the features are indexed by all strings of length k. Direct computation of all the relevant features would be impractical even for moderately sized texts and k. We have used a dynamic programming style computation for computing the kernel directly from the input sequences without explicitly calculating the feature vectors. This has been possible since we have used a kernel-based learning machine. The experiments indicate that our algorithm can provide an e ective alternative to the more standard word feature based kernel used in previous SVM applications for text classi cation Joachims (1998). We were also able to compare them with results obtained using a string kernel that only considered contiguous strings, thus providing a continuum of varying the parameter to 0."

At an early stage, however, it was found that the class of definite functions was too restricted to allow the determination of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the determinants of \u00a7 10. The discovery that this could be done for functions of positive or negative type, and the fact that almost all the theorems which are true of definite functions are, with slight modification, true of these, led finally to the abandonment of the original plan in favour of a discussion of the properties of functions belonging to the wider classes. The first part of the memoir is devoted to the definition of various terms employed, and to the re-statement of the consequences which follow from Hilbert\u2019s theorem."

We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can be computed by the Nystrom method (which is used for the numerical solution of eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller system of size m < n, and then expanding the results back up to n dimensions. The computational complexity of a predictor using this approximation is O(m2n). We report experiments on the USPS and abalone data sets and show that we can set m \u226a n without any significant decrease in the accuracy of the solution."
