An important area of research involves designing a machine that can adequately improve its own performance as well as solve other problems normally requiring human intelligence. Work in heuristic programming that seems most relevant to this goal will be discussed at length. Important subproblems are devising techniques for self-improvement, the general problem of deciding what task to best work on next in a network of tasks, and the general problem of how to mechanize learning or inductive inference. Some work in linguistics and pattern recognition is directly concerned with the induction problem. Another area of research that will be treated is simulation of organic evolution."

                "text": "The problems of heuristic programming-of making computers solve really difficult problems-are divided into five main areas: Search, Pattern-Recognition, Learning, Planning, and Induction. A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

The focus in time is the period 1963-1968. Brief tours are made over a variety of topics: generality, integrated robots, game playing, theorem proving, semantic information processing, etc. One program, which employs the heuristic search paradigm to generate explanatory hypotheses in the analysis of mass spectra of organic molecules, is described in some detail. The problem of representation for problem solving systems is discussed. Various centers of excellence in the artificial intelligence research area is mentioned. A bibliography of 76 references is given."

                "text": "When a certain problem cannot be solved directly, it is often possible to write a program to search for a solution. If the number of possibilities to be searched in order to find a solution is sufficiently small, the problem is trivial since the program can consider all possibilities. For an intellectually difficult problem, the number of possibilities to be searched is so large (sometimes infinite) that for all practical purposes there is no exhaustive procedure. For example, in most kinds of theorem-proving including predicate calculus, the number of possibilities to be searched is potentially infinite. In order to guarantee a perfect first move in checkers, the program would have to search through about 1040 possible games. In chess the number is about 10120.Even tremendous improvements in hardware would hardly dent tasks requiring the search of so many possibilities. It is much better to consider alternative ways of defining the search and modifying the search, that is, to consider heuristic search techniques. In general, a heuristic is a rule of thumb, strategy, method or trick used to improve the efficiency of a system which tries to discover the solutions of complex problems. Some heuristics are specific, that is, limited to one problem-solving domain, such as proving theorems in geometry. Other heuristics are general, that is, applicable to several domains. For example, the heuristic of \u201cworking backwards\u201d is useful in many theorem-proving and problem-solving domains."

This system demonstrates what can reasonably be called an ability to \"understand\" semantic information. SIR''s semantic and deductive ability is based on the construction of an internal model, which uses word associations and property lists, for the relational information normally conveyed in conversational statements. A format-matching procedure extracts semantic content from English sentences. If an input sentence is declarative, the system adds appropriate information to the model. If an input sentence is a question, the system searches the model until it either finds the answer or determines why it cannot find the answer. In all cases SIR reports its conclusions. The system has some capacity to recognize exceptions to general rules, resolve certain semantic ambiguities, and modify its model structure in order to save computer memory space. Judging from its conversational ability, SIR is more \"intelligent\" than any existing question-answering system. The author describes how this ability was developed and how the basic features of SIR compare with those of other systems. The working system, SIR , is a first step toward intelligent machine communication. The author proposes a next step by describing how to construct a more general system which is less complex and yet more powerful than SIR . This proposed system contains a generalized version of the SIR model, a formal logical system called SIR1 , and a computer program for testing the truth of SIR1 statements with respect to the generalized model by using partial proof procedures in the predicate calculus. The thesis also describes the formal properties of SIR1 and how they relate to the logical structure of SIR ."

Kalah is a two-person game. In another experiment the program, after some modifications, played the game of kalah. This program was compared with another tree-searching procedure, the Alpha-Beta minimax procedure; the results have been encouraging since the program is fast and efficient. Its greatest usefulness is in solving large problems. It is hoped that this program has added one more step toward the goal of eventually obtaining computer programs which can solve intellectually difficult problems."

A method for selecting \u201cuseful\u201d transformations, i.e. those which will most probably lead to a solution, is developed. Two problem-solving processes based on the above are defined; one, called the FORTRAN Deductive System (FDS) is shown to be more powerful than the other. A class of problems to which FDS will always find solutions is constructed. Examples of solutions found by a computer implementation of FDS are given and, in some cases, are compared with human performance. Finally, FDS is compared with some of the better-known problem-solving systems."

Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subsets of English. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries\u2014with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems\u2014may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and question answering."

It is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty. The mini-max procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. The M & N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors. An M & N procedure was written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that the M & N procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure. The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work."

                "text": "Introduction Few of those who have seen a modern high-speed digital computer digest and transform a mass of data in less time than it takes to follow the process in the mind can suppress a certain amount of speculation concerning the future of such machines. Under the assumption that the computer is operating at the mere threshhold of its capacity in performing the tasks we have thus far delegated to it, a long-range program directed at the problem of \"intelligent\" behavior and learning in machines has been established at the IBM Research Center in New York (Gelernter and Rochester, 1958). In particular the technique of heuristic programming is under detailed investigation as a means to the end of applying large-scale digital computers to the solution of a difficult class of problems currently considered to be beyond their capabilities; namely those problems that seem to require the agent of human intelligence and ingenuity for their solution. It is difficult to characterize such problems further, except, perhaps, to remark rather vaguely that they generally involve complex decision processes in a potentially infinite and uncontrollable environment. If, however, we should restrict the universe of problems to those that amount to the discovery of a proof for a theorem in some well-defined formal system, then the distinguishing characteristics of those problems of special interest to us are brought clearly into focus. We should like our machine to be able to prove many of the theorems presented to it in a formal system that is manifestly undecidable. Further, as the machine 134 gains \"experience\" in proving theorems, we should expect it to be able to solve problems that were earlier beyond its capabilities. The requirement that a machine should deal with undecidable systems places a fundamental restriction on its modus operandi. Finding a suitable algorithm, the obvious technique for the solution of problems on a digital computer, is no longer acceptable for the simple reason that no such algorithm exists. An exhaustive search for the initial axioms and theorems of the proof, combined with exhaustive development of the proof sequence by systematically applying the rules of transformation until the required proof has been produced, has been shown to be much too time-consuming for so simple a logic as propositional calculus (Newell, Shaw and Simon, 1957 a). It is a fortiori out of the question for any of the more interesting logics. A remaining alternative is \u2026"

The program is called SAINT, an acronym for \"Symbolic Automatic INTegrator.\" This paper discusses the SAINT program and its performance. SAINT performs indefinite integration. I t also performs definite and multiple integration when these are trivial extensions of indefinite integration. I t uses many of the methods and heuristics of students attacking the same problems. SAINT took an average of two minutes each to solve 52 of the 54 attempted problems taken from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman calculus final examinations. Based on this and other experiments with SAINT, some conclusions concerning computer solution of such problems are: (1) Pattern recognition is of fundamental importance. (2) Great benefit would have been derived from a larger memory and more convenient symbol manipulating facilities. (3) The solution of a symbolic integration problem by a commercially available computer is far cheaper and faster than by man."

Another author considered GO to be somewhat mysterious, making it a challenge to those interested in automating it. Apparently the game was described as being mysterious to indicate that people were able to play it without knowing how they were able to play so well. More study of this complex game may reward us with new insight into human perceptual and problem solving abilities as well as foster the development of new techniques for artificial intelligence. This report describes a program which plays GO. The program uses an information processing model to produce perceptual features which are seen by human GO players, and is capable of several responses to the recognition of significant configurations of these perceptual features."

                "text": "A considerable step forward in the development of theorem-proving by machine was taken by Robinson (1965) with the introduction of the resolution method. In this method the conjunction of the axioms and the negation of the theorem to be proved are in the usual way (cf. Davis, 1963) converted into a conjunction of so-called clauses, each clause being a disjunction of atoms (i.e. atomic predicates) which may or may not be negated. The arguments of these predicates are variables or constants or functions of these. For the theorem to be valid the conjunction of this set of clauses must be shown to be unsatisfiable. Previous methods (cf. Davis, 1963) used Herbrand's theorem directly by explicitly instantiating these clauses over a finite subset of the Herbrand universe of constants, and then attempting to show that the conjunction of the resulting set of clauses, the so-called ground clauses, led to a truth-functional contradiction. (A ground clause is any clause in which each variable has been replaced by a constant belonging to the Herbrand universe.) In Robinson's method, the test for unsatisfiability is carried out directly on the clauses, and not on their instantiated or ground versions. This is effected by the iteration of a single operation termed resolution. To describe this operation, let us\u2014as is customary\u2014term any atom or any negated atom a literal, and term two literals which are negations of each other complements. Resolution operates on two clauses, when one of them contains at least one literal whose complement is either contained in the other or can be generated in the other by some substitution for its arguments. When this is the case, a new clause known as the resolvent is formed from the two parent clauses, which consists of all the literals in the parents except the matched complementary pairs. (The arguments in some of the literals may, of course, have been changed if a substitution had been required for the matching.) Robinson's basic result is that if resolutions are carried out on the original set of clauses and the ones generated by these operations, then the original set is unsatisfiable if and only if an empty clause can be generated. So the theorem is proved when an empty clause has been generated."

This framework originates from previous work on problem-solving procedures for theorem proving. Procedures for syntactic analysis are represented as reduction procedures where a problem undergoes a sequence of nested transformations that result in a set of simpler subordinate problems whose solution implies the solution of the original problem. The representation of the syntactic analysis problem provides a unifying basis for expressing a variety of syntactic analysis procedures, both existing ones as well as new, proposed, procedures. Such a common basis contributes to a better understanding and systemization of the programming of syntax-directed compilers and of other translators whose source language is a context-free fragment of natural language, e.g., some 'question-answering' systems. A useful concept of computational effort is defined, and it is used as a guide for the formulation of new efficient procedures. Heuristic procedures for syntactic analysis are suggested. Some features of these procedures are relevant to the design of advanced syntax-directed translators. (Author)"

The idea that machines could be made to play this game is very old and there is considerable li terature devoted to this problem which has a long and amusing history, including the well known specious machines which were operated by humans hidden inside the alleged machinery. We shall mention merely an article by C. Shannon on the problem of coding for machines which could play chess. There is an account by Turing of a computing machine which actually played a game of chess. One game played by his computer is given in the book Faster than Thought by Bowden. Recently, an article in the Russian newspaper Pravda mentioned the fact tha t a computing machine in Moscow had been coded to play the game of chess. No detailed account was given either of the method by which this game was coded nor of the results of such play beyond a s tatement that a fair chess player is able to beat the machine. In Los Alamos recently an a t tempt was made to t ry out the ideas which some of us had advanced during the course of the last few years by putting them to test on one of the Los Alamos computing machines. The problem of coding the rules of chess, i.e., of making individual moves, is of course very simple. The problem of finding methods of play which would enable the machine to produce anything even faintly comparable with the result of human planning is extremely difficult. This difficulty is evident at every step of the game. Before a decision can be made to make a move, an enormous number of positions has to be surveyed if one wants to look \"ahead\" for even a moderate number of moves. If we assume that the average number of legal moves at any given stage is of order 20, then to look 3 moves ahead, i.e., 3 by white and 3 by black, would involve consideration of 206 chains of moves. At the end of each of such chains, an evaluation must be made according to some prescribed rule which eventually singles out one move in preference to others. The game which was played on the machine is not really chess but rather, so to speak, a miniature of it; we play on a 6 x 6 board, omitting the bishops; and with 6 pawns on each side. (For the first move we allow the pawn to move only one square ahead.) The game retains much of the flavor of real chess but is very much simpler. Castling is not permitted; promotion of a pawn was allowed to take place as usual. The reason for the reduction of chess to this mutilated version was in order to allow the machine to look two moves ahead, i.e., 2 by white and 2 by black. The time taken to consider all chains came out on the average to about 12 minutes per nmve; thus it was possible to play a game in the course of"

To belong to this family a problem must be expressible in the language of graph theory as that of finding a path between two specified nodes of a specified graph. The method depends upon the evaluation of intermediate states of the problem according to the extent to which they have features in common with the goal state. We define evaluation functions each of which assigns to any state of the problem a value which is in some way related to its \u2018distance\u2019 from the goal state. Equivalently we assign to nodes of the corresponding graph values which are related to the distance over the graph from the goal node. Distance is reckoned as the smallest number of arcs needed to connect two nodes. An Algol program, the Graph Traverser, has been written to operate in this context. It is designed in a completely general way, and has two \u2018empty\u2019 procedures one of which must be written to specify the structure of the graph, that is the constraints of the problem, and the other to define an evaluation function. Results obtained by supplying the program with definitions of various sliding block puzzles and also a simple problem of algebraic manipulation are reported for a range of evaluation functions."

                "text": "The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this \u201cdecision\u201d problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available\u2014that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking \u201cforever\u201d in the case of a formula which is not valid\u2014and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.\n Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.\nIn the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. \u00a76, below.\nIt should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to \u201cgenuine\u201d mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are \u201cshort,\u201d must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele"

These experiments culminated in large complex computer programs which allow a mathematician to prove mathematical theorems on an man/machine basis. SAM V, the fifth program, is oriented primarily toward the development of efficient automatic techniques for handling some of the more basic processes of mathematical deduction, and toward the realization of efficient real-time interaction between man and machine through the use of cathode-ray tube displays. SAM V's most notable success is the solution of an open problem in lattice theory."

Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based on the fund~mental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate etdeulus, is examined with ~ view towards improving the efticieney and widening the range of practical applicability of these procedures. A elose analysis of the process of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of t ruth-funct ional analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be combined into a single new process (called resolution), i terating which is vastty more ef[ieient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution process is presented in the form of a system of first<~rder logic with .just one inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is proved; the simplest proof-procedure based oil the system is then the direct implementation of the proof of completeness.

The first part of this dissertation presents a class of algorithms, denoted VGA, for solving the two point shortest path problem in directed graphs with non-negative edge weights. This class is a bi-directional extension of the most efficient known uni-directional shortest path algorithms. While it has long been realized that hi-directional algorithms often provide computational savings, a theory of this has not been forthcoming until now. This theory shows how a hi-directional method using the proposed cardinal@ comparison strategy is a priori the best shortest path algorithm within the class of algorithms VGA. These theoretical results are verified by extensive tests of VGA. A computer program was written where several standard uni-directional and bi-directional strategies were compared with cardinality comparison. The program randomly generated a number of large directed graphs and each strategy in turn was tried on numerous path problems within these graphs. In heuristic search for artificial intelligence problems, algorithms similar to the two point shortest path problem are used. The spaces searched are enormous , often infinite, and in consequence the constraint on finding the shortest path is abandoned. The concern is for finding any solution path with minimum effort. The second part of the dissertation presents a theory of these problems and some experiments with the fifteen puzzle in using the methods suggested by this theory of heuristic search. The evaluation function directing the search is the sum of the distance from the starting node and an estimate of the distance to the goal. This second component is the heuristic term, and if accurate, allows efficient path finding in-iii-large spaces. Some results on the effect of error in the heuristic term are presented. Especially interesting is theorem '7.9, showing that the distance from the start should be incorporated in the evaluation function. This particular result runs counter to the reliance strictly on the heuristic term, a practice which is widespread. Bi-directional heuristic search is also proposed. VGHA, a bi-directional class of algorithms, is an extension of the Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael uni-directional heuristic search algorithms. Their results are extended to this more general class. These methods are used in solving fifteen puzzle problems and comparing the number of nodes explored. It is a continuance of the empirical work started by Doran and Michie with the \u2026"

The first produces guaranteed optimal solution for problems involving no more than 13 cities; the time required (IBM 7094 II) varies from 60 milliseconds for a 9-city problem to 1.75 seconds for a 13-city problem. The second algorithm produces precisely characterized, locally optimal solutions for large problems (up to 145 cities) in an extremely short time and is based on a general heuristic approach believed to be of general applicability to various optimization problems. The average time required to obtain a locally optimal solution is under 30n3 microseconds where n is the number of cities involved. Repeated runs on a problem from random initial tours result in a high probability of finding the optimal solution among the locally optimal solutions obtained. For large problems where many locally optimal solutions have to be obtained in order to be reasonably assured of having the optimal solution, an efficient reduction scheme is incorporated in the program to reduce the total computation time by a substantial amount."

Since the construction of the algorithm is obtained by formal theorem-proving techniques, the programs that PROW writes are free from logical errors and do not have to be debugged The user of PROW can make PROW write programs in languages other than LISP by modifying the part of PROW that translates an algorithm to a LISP program. Thus PROW can be modified to write programs in any language In the end of this paper, it is shown that PROW can also be used as a question-answering program"

The hypotheses which are produced describe molecular structures which are plausible explanations of the data. The hypotheses are generated systematically within the program's theory of chemical stability and within limiting constraints which are inferred from the data by heuristic rules. The program excludes hypotheses inconsistent with the data and lists its candidate explanatory hypotheses in order of decreasing plausibility.

We restrict ourselves to the case where at least one path exists between any two nodes. We now consider two problems. Problem 1. Constrnct the tree of minimum total length between the n nodes. (A tree is a graph with one and only one path between every two nodes.) In the course of the construction that we present here, the branches are subdivided into three sets: I. the branches definitely assignec~ to the tree under construction (they will form a subtree) ; II. the branches from which the next branch to be added to set I, will be selected ; III. the remaining branches (rejected or not yet considered). The nodes are subdivided into two sets: A. the nodes connected by the branches of set I, B. the remaining nodes (one and only one branch of set II will lead to each of these nodes), We start the construction by choosing an arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all branches that end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From then onwards we perform the following two steps repeatedly. Step 1. The shortest branch of set II is removed from this set and added to"

Practical problems connected with implementing the stack algorithm are discussed and a scheme is described that facilitates satisfactory performance even with limited stack storage capacity. Preliminary simulation results estimating the decoding effort and the needed stack siazree presented."

An excellent survey of such systems can be found in Simmons.1 A more recent and critical survey of data-retrieval systems prepared by Kasher points out what he considers to be some of the major weaknesses of previous work. One of the problems cited by Kasher is the difficulty of dealing with the inherent ambiguity of natural language. In this paper we will propose a technique for dealing with syntactic ambiguity that involves the use of a restricted semantic universe of discourse. The universe of discourse is defined by means of a graphic display console. We will show by means of an example taken from the area of electrical circuits how this technique can be used to resolve syntactic ambiguity."
