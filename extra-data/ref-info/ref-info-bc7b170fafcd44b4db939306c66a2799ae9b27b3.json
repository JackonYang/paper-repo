The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

In order to compensate for this behaviour, several choices of the WR must be initially considered. In the case of handwritten sentence/phrase recognition, linguistic constraints may be applied in order to improve the results of the WR. This paper discusses two statistical methods of applying linguistic constraints to the output of an WR on input consisting of sentences/phrases. The first is based on collocations and can be used to promote lower ranked word choices or to propose new words. The second is a Markov model of syntax and is based on syntactic categories (tags) associated with words. In each case, we show the improvement in the word recognition rate as a result of applying these constraints."

With the method described in the paper the usability of the database is greatly improved because accurate bounding box information and ground truth for individual words (including punctuation characters) is now available as well. Applying the segmentation scheme on 417 pages of handwritten text a correct word segmentation rate of 98% has been achieved, producing correct bounding boxes for over 25,000 handwritten words."

In order to compensate for this behaviour, several choices of the HWR must be initially considered. In the case of handwritten sentence/phrase recognition, linguistic constraints may be applied in order to improve the results of the HWR. This paper discusses two statistical methods of applying syntactic constraints to the output of an HWR on input consisting of sentences/phrases. Both methods are based on syntactic categories (tags) associated with words. The rst is a purely statistical method, the second is a hybrid method which combines higher-level syntactic information (hypertags) with statistical information regarding transitions between hypertags."

Key ideas employed in each functional module, which have been developed for dealing with the diversity of handwriting in its various aspects with a goal of system reliability and robustness, are described in this paper. Preliminary experiments show promising results in terms of speed and accuracy."

We mainly deal with the various methods that were proposed to realize the core of recognition in a word recognition system. These methods are discussed in view of the two most important properties of such a system: the size and nature of the lexicon involved, and whether or not a segmentation stage is present. We classify the field into three categories: segmentation-free methods, which compare a sequence of observations derived from a word image with similar references of words in the lexicon; segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word; and the perception-oriented approach, that relates to methods that perform a human-like reading technique, in which anchor features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase."

The preprocessing, sentence to word segmentation and word recognition approaches are presented along with some critical reviews. The overall engine is a combination of a global feature scheme with an HMM module. The global features consist of the encoding of the relative position of the ascenders, descenders and loops within a word. The HMM uses one feature set based on the orientation of contour points as well as their distance to the baselines. Our system is fully trainable, reducing to a strict minimum the number of hand-set parameters. The system is also modular and independent of specific languages as we have to deal with at least two languages in Canada, namely English and French. The system can be easily adapted to read other European languages based on the Roman alphabet. The system is continuously tested on data from the local phone company, and we report here the results on a balanced French database of approximately 2000 cheques with specified amounts."

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated.

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

                "text": "An adaptive statistical language model is described, which successfully integrates long distance linguistic information with other knowledge sources. Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

The model used is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The lines are firstly preprocessed, then segmented and characterized by two types of features. We create a HMM for each street name by simply concatenating the corresponding letter models, elementary HMM learned on a large city name database. A street name may often be surrounded by other information on the left and on the right within the delivery line. These phenomena are roughly modelled by trigrams. The global model is then simply obtained by the concatenation of trigram models with the HMMs corresponding to street names."

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.

Several smoothing methods for ME models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in ME smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between ME and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of ME smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that fuzzy ME smoothing performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."

For all but pathological channels the bounds are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates above R_{0} , the computational cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
