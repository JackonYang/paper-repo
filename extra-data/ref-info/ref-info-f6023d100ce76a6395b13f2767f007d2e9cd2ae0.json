Both the one class SVM as a class distribution estimator and two classes SVM as a classifier are taken into account. For the latter, two representative display strategies are studied. Since the common kernels often rely on inner product or L/sub p/ norm in the input space, they are infeasible in the region-based image retrieval systems that use variable-length representations. To resolve the issue, a new kind of kernel that is a generalization of Gaussian kernel is proposed. Experimental results on a database of 10,000 general-purpose images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach."

A kernel method to accomplish this goal consists of a representation stage - which computes the smallest sphere in feature space enclosingthe positive examples - and a classification stage - which uses the obtained sphere as a decision surface to determine the positivity of new examples. In this paper we describe a kernel well suited to represent, identify, and recognize 3D objects from unconstrained images. The kernel we introduce, based on Hausdorff distance, is tailored to deal with grey-level image matching. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on several data sets of faces and objects of artistic relevance, like statues."

We represent input images through large dimensional and usually sparse histograms which, depending on the task, are either color histograms or co-occurrence matrices. Support vector machines are trained on these sparse inputs directly, to solve problems like indoor/outdoor classification and cityscape retrieval from image databases. The experimental results indicate that the use of a kernel function derived from the computer vision literature leads to better recognition results than off the shelf kernels. According to our findings, it appears that image classification problems can be addressed with no need of explicit feature extraction or dimensionality reduction stages. We argue that this might be used as the starting point for developing image classification systems which can be easily tuned to a number of different tasks."

Given two images, the method checks pixelwise if the grey values of one are contained in an appropriate interval around the corresponding grey values of the other. Under certain assumptions, this provides a tight bound on the directed Hausdorff distance of the two grey-level surfaces. The proposed technique can be seen as an equivalent in the grey level case of a matching method developed for the binary case by Huttenlocher et al. [2]. The method fits naturally an implementation based on comparison of data structures and requires no numerical computations whatsoever. Moreover, it is able to match images successfully in the presence of severe occlusions. The range of possible applications is vast; we present preliminary, very good results on stereo and motion correspondence and iconic indexing in real images, with and without occlusion."

How, then, can it be possible to build a tool for indexing into a large database of, say, thousands of images, which works effectively in `interactive time' on affordable hardware? One important optimization is to take advantage of interaction with the user to find out what types of variation are expected in the database, and to rely on the user to discriminate between similar-looking objects. Another is to create appropriate data structures off-line to speed on-line searches. We are building a tool, called FINDIT, for locating the image of an object from within a large number of images of scenes which may contain the object. The user outlines an object in an image that he wants to find in the database, and specifies the constraints on the transformations of the object that are expected to occur. The program acts as a filter to quickly reduce the possible number of candidates to a number small enough to be perused by the user. FINDIT chooses an appropriate search algorithm depending on the selection of constraints by the user."

We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

As presented, their method is restricted to the case where W, the weighted adjacency matrix, is positive definite. Although many common measures of image similarity (i.e. kernels) are positive definite, a popular example being Gaussian-weighted distance, there are important cases that are not. In this work, we present a modification to Nystrom-NCut that does not require W to be positive definite. The modification only affects the orthogonalization step, and in doing so it necessitates one additional O(m3) operation, where m is the number of random samples used in the approximation. As such it is of interest to know which kernels are positive definite and which are indefinite. In addressing this issue, we further develop connections between NCut and related methods in the kernel machines literature. We provide a proof that the Gaussian-weighted chi-squared kernel is positive definite, which has thus far only been conjectured. We also explore the performance of the approximation algorithm on a variety of grouping cues including contour, color and texture."

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

It is assumed that only examples of the target class are available. This classifier has to be constructed such that objects not originating from the target set, by definition outlier objects, are not classified as target objects. In previous research the support vector data description (SVDD) is proposed to solve the problem of one-class classification. It models a hypersphere around the target set, and by the introduction of kernel functions, more flexible descriptions are obtained. In the original optimization of the SVDD, two parameters have to be given beforehand by the user. To automatically optimize the values for these parameters, the error on both the target and outlier data has to be estimated. Because no outlier examples are available, we propose a method for generating artificial outliers, uniformly distributed in a hypersphere. An (relative) efficient estimate for the volume covered by the one-class classifiers is obtained, and so an estimate for the outlier error. Results are shown for artificial data and for real world data."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition."

Our study supports the hypothesis that the SVM approach is able to extract the relevant discriminatory information from the training data and we present results showing superior performance in comparison with benchmark methods. However, when the representation space already captures and emphasises the discriminatory information (e.g., Fisher's linear discriminant), SVM loose their superiority. The results also indicate that the SVM are robust against changes in illumination provided these are adequately represented in the training data. The proposed system is evaluated on a large database of 295 people obtaining highly competitive results: an equal error rate of 1% for verification and a rank-one error rate of 2% for recognition (or 98% correct rank-one recognition)."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

In the component system we first locate facial components, extract them and combine them into a single feature vector which is classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The two global systems recognize faces by classifying a single feature vector consisting of the gray values of the whole face image. In the first global system we trained a single SVM classifier for each person in the database. The second system consists of sets of viewpoint-specific SVM classifiers and involves clustering during training. We performed extensive tests on a database which included faces rotated up to about 40/spl deg/ in depth. The component system clearly outperformed both global systems on all tests."
