The combination of such degrees of belief is performed through numerical fusion operators. A very large variety of such operators has been proposed in the literature. We propose a classification of these operators issued from different data fusion theories (probabilities, fuzzy sets, possibilities, Dempster- Shafer, etc.) w.r.t. their behaviour. Three classes are thus defined: context independent constant behaviour operators, which have the same behaviour (compromise, disjunction or conjunction) whatever the values to be combined, context independent variable behaviour operators (whose behaviour depends on the combined values), and context dependent operators (where the result depends also on some global knowledge like conflict, reliability of sources). This classification provides a guide for choosing an operator in a given problem. This choice can then be refined from the desired properties of the operators, from their decisiveness, and by examining how they deal with conflictual situations. These aspects are illustrated on simple examples in multispectral satellite imaging. In particular, we stress the interest of the third class for classification problems."

In the proposed scheme a Fuzzy reasoning system includes a training stage during which the most appropriate aggregation operators are selected. To allow for different importance to be given to different pieces of evidence, the Fuzzy membership functions used are allowed to take values in a range [0; w], with w \u2260 1. Then the need arises for the generalization of the aggregetion operators to cope with such membership functions.

For this purpose we take into consideration the probability density functions of the independent variables of the problem when we compute the least square error approximation. Our methodoloy is demonstrated with the help of some real data concerning the problem of risk of desertification assessment for some burned forests in Attica, Greece where the parameters of the Bayesian network constructed for this task are successfully estimated given a neural network trained with a set of data."
