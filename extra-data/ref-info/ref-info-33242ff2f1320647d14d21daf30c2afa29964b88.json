Contrary to the bounding-box representation used in most past page segmentation and classification approaches which assume rectangular regions, there is a need for a more flexible description which also retains most of the functionality of the representation by rectangles. In the first part of this paper, the practical considerations of describing and handling the complex-shaped regions are examined and an appropriate representation scheme is proposed. For page classification, a new approach based on the description of white space inside regions is presented. In contrast to previous page classification approaches, skewed and complex-shaped regions are handled efficiently and the features are derived with no need for time-consuming accesses of the pixel-based image data."

The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"

The top-down method segments and labels the page image simultaneously using publication-specific information in the form of a page-grammar. The bottom-up method naively segments the document into rectangles that contain individual connected components, combines blocks using knowledge about generic layout objects, and identifies logical objects using publication-specific knowledge. Both methods are based on the X-Y tree representation of a page image. The procedures are demonstrated on scanned and synthesized bit-maps of the title pages of technical articles."

Unlike techniques that rely on OCR output, our method is region-based: the segmentation output, described as a set of regions together with their types, output order etc., is matched against the pre-stored set of ground-truth regions. Misclassifications, splitting, and merging of regions are among the errors that are detected by the system. Each error is weighted individually for a particular application and a global estimate of segmentation quality is derived. The system can be customized to benchmark specific aspects of segmentation (e.g., headline detection) and according to the type of error correction that might follow (e.g., re-typing). Segmentation ground-truth files are quickly and easily generated and edited using GroundsKeeper, an X-Window based tool that allows one to view a document, manually draw regions (arbitrary polygons) on it, and specify information about each region (e.g., type, parent)."
