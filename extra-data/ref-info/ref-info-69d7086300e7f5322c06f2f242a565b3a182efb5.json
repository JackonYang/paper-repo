For a network of n nodes, n static or n/2 periodic attractors may be stored. The algorithm allows programming of the network vector field independent of the patterns to be stored. Stability of patterns, basin geometry, and rates of convergence may be controlled. For orthonormal patterns, the learning operation reduces to a kind of periodic outer product rule that allows local, additive, commutative, incremental learning. Standing or traveling wave cycles may be stored to mimic the kind of oscillating spatial patterns that appear in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb and prepyriform cortex during inspiration and suffice, in the bulb, to predict the pattern recognition behavior of rabbits in classical conditioning experiments. These attractors arise, during simulated inspiration, through a multiple Hopf bifurcation, which can act as a critical \"decision point\" for their selection by a very small input pattern."

                "text": "Network algorithms and architectures for pattern recognition derived from neural models of the olfactory system are reviewed. These span a range from highly abstract to physiologically detailed, and employ the kind of dynamical complexity observed in olfactory cortex, ranging from oscillation to chaos. A simple architecture and algorithm for analytically guaranteed associative memory storage of analog patterns, continuous sequences, and chaotic attractors in the same network is described. A matrix inversion determines network weights, given prototype patterns to be stored. There are N units of capacity in an N node network with 3N2 weights. It costs one unit per static attractor, two per Fourier component of each sequence, and three to four per chaotic attractor. There are no spurious attractors, and for sequences there is a Liapunov function in a special coordinate system which governs the approach of transient states to stored trajectories. Unsupervised or supervised incremental learning algorithms for pattern classification, such as competitive learning or bootstrap Widrow-Hoff can easily be implemented. The architecture can be ''folded'' into a recurrent network with higher order weights that can be used as a model of cortex that stores oscillatory and chaotic attractors by a Hebb rule. Network performance is demonstrated by application to the problem of real-time handwritten digit recognition. An effective system with on-line learning has been written by Eeckman and Baird for the Macintosh. It utilizes static, oscillatory, and/or chaotic attractors of two kinds--Lorenze attractors, or attractors resulting from chaotically interacting oscillatory modes. The successful application to an industrial pattern recognition problem of a network architecture of considerable physiological and dynamical complexity, developed by Freeman and Yao, is described. The data sets of the problem come in three classes of difficulty, and performance of the biological network is favorably compared with that of several other network and statistical pattern recognition methods.\u00a9 (1991) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Nonnumerical formulas, as well as numerical learning algorithms using hidden units for the storage of static and periodic attractors, are introduced. These algorithms allow programming of the network vector field regardless of the patterns to be stored. Stability of patterns and cycles, basin geometry, and rates of convergence may be controlled. For a network of n nodes, n static of n/2 periodic attractors can be stored by a projection algorithm. For orthogonal patterns, this learning operation reduces to a kind of periodic outer product rule that allows local, additive, and commutative incremental learning. Standing- or traveling-wave cycles may be stored to mimic the kind of oscillating spatial patterns that appear in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb and prepyriform cortex during inspiration, and suffice, in the bulb, to predict the pattern recognition behavior of rabbits in classical conditioning experiments. These attractors arise, during simulated inspiration, through a multiple Hopf bifurcation, which can act as a critical decision point for their selection by very small input patterns.<<ETX>>"

The model may be considered a variant of Hopfield\u2019s model of continuous analog neural dynamics. Excitatory and inhibitory cell types in the bulb and the anatomical architecture of their connection requires a nonsymmetric coupling matrix. As the mean input level rises during each breath of the animal, the system bifurcates from homogenous equilibrium to a spatially patterned oscillation.

Using a local Hebb-like learning rule for primary and higher order synapses at the ends of the long range connections, the system learns to store the kinds of oscillation amplitude patterns observed in olfactory and visual cortex.

A matrix inversion determines network weights, given prototype patterns to be stored. There are N units of capacity in an N node network with 3N2 weights. It costs one unit per static attractor, two per Fourier component of each sequence, and four per chaotic attractor. There are no spurious attractors, and there is a Liapunov function in a special coordinate system which governs the approach of transient states to stored trajectories. Unsupervised or supervised incremental learning algorithms for pattern classification, such as competitive learning or bootstrap Widrow-Hoff can easily be implemented. The architecture can be \"folded\" into a recurrent network with higher order weights that can be used as a model of cortex that stores oscillatory and chaotic attractors by a Hebb rule. Hierarchical sensory-motor control networks may be constructed of interconnected \"cortical patches\" of these network modules. Network performance is being investigated by application to the problem of real time handwritten digit recognition."

The network has explicit excitatory neural populations with local inhibitory interneu- ron feedback that forms a set of nonlinear oscillators coupled only by long range excitatory connections. Using a local Hebb-like learning rule for primary and higher order synapses at the ends of the long range connections, the system can learn to store the kinds of oscillation amplitude and phase patterns observed in olfactory and visual cortex. The network can be truely self-organizing because a synapse can modify itself according to it\u2019s own pre and postsynaptic activity during stimulation by an input pattern to be learned. The neurons of the neuron pools modeled here can be viewed as operating in the linear region of the usual sigmoidal axonal non- linearity, and multiple memories are stored instead by the learned synaptic nonlinearities"

The spatial spectrum of the bulbar EEG was derived and compared with the spectrum predicted for the granule cell generator. Spatial filters were devised to identify, enhance, or remove the granule cell contribution to the EEG. Spatial deconvolution was applied to the filtered granule cell activity patterns to correct for distortion caused by volume conduction. The results indicated that the bulb generated odor-specific spatial patterns in rabbits trained to discriminate between two odors. The odor-specific information was not localizable to subsets of channels. This suggested that the discriminative output of the bulb involved the entire structure, even though the receptor input was delivered to limited subsets of mitral cells."
