We show that this outstanding performance extends to shape-based object detection in the usual windowing framework, to amorphous object detection as a texture classification task, and finally to context understanding These tasks are performed on a large set of images which were collected as a benchmark for the problem of scene understanding. The final system is able to reliably identify cars, pedestrians, bicycles, sky, road, buildings and trees in a diverse set of images."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

In this paper, we are concerned with how these tasks can be combined in a way that improves the performance of each of them. Inspired by Barrow and Tenenbaum, we present a flexible framework for interfacing scene analysis processes using intrinsic images. Each intrinsic image is a registered map describing one characteristic of the scene. We apply this framework to develop an integrated 3D scene understanding system with estimates of surface orientations, occlusion boundaries, objects, camera viewpoint, and relative depth. Our experiments on a set of 300 outdoor images demonstrate that these tasks reinforce each other, and we illustrate a coherent scene understanding with automatically reconstructed 3D models."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

Moreover, they offer an attractive compromise between information content and repeatability and encompass a wide variety of local shape structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor encoding the geometric configuration of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy to reuse in other frameworks, for example, as a replacement or addition to interest points (IPs). Software for detecting and describing kAS is released at http://lear.inrialpes.fr/software. We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful sliding-window object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse object classes and more than 1,400 images, we (1) study the evolution of performance as the degree of feature complexity k varies and determine the best degree, (2) show that kAS substantially outperform IPs for detecting shape-based classes, and (3) compare our object detector to the recent state-of-the-art system by Dalal and Triggs (2005)."

To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

The integration of these different types of approaches should boost performance for both tasks as object detection can profit from powerful scene labeling and also pixel-wise scene labeling can profit from powerful object detection. Consequently, first approaches have been proposed that aim to integrate both object detection and scene labeling in one framework. This paper proposes a novel approach based on conditional random field (CRF) models that extends existing work by 1) formulating the integration as a joint labeling problem of object and scene classes and 2) by systematically integrating dynamic information for the object detection task as well as for the scene labeling task. As a result, the approach is applicable to highly dynamic scenes including both fast camera and object movements. Experiments show the applicability of the novel approach to challenging real-world video sequences and systematically analyze the contribution of different system components to the overall performance."

Our approach couples topic models originally developed for text analysis with spatial transformations, and thus consistently accounts for geometric constraints. By building integrated scene models, we may discover contextual relationships, and better exploit partially labeled training images. We first consider images of isolated objects, and show that sharing parts among object categories improves detection accuracy when learning from few examples. Turning to multiple object scenes, we propose nonparametric models which use Dirichlet processes to automatically learn the number of parts underlying each object category, and objects composing each scene. The resulting transformed Dirichlet process (TDP) leads to Monte Carlo algorithms which simultaneously segment and recognize objects in street and office scenes.\n"

Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difficult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classification Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classifiers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited \"black box\" interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classifiers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction."

Given an input image, we retrieve its best matches from a large database with annotated images using our modified, coarse-to-fine SIFT flow algorithm that aligns the structures within two images. Based on the dense scene correspondence obtained from the SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations, and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on a challenging database. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure."

We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback to the user."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."
