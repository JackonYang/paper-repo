The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle nuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews."

We derive a measure based on an extension of multinomial na\u00efve Bayes classification that combines multiple language models to estimate the most likely grade level for a given passage. The resulting classifier is not specific to any particular subject and can be trained with relatively little labeled data. We perform predictions for individual Web pages in English and compare our performance to widely-used semantic variables from traditional readability measures. We show that with minimal changes, the classifier may be retrained for use with French Web documents. For both English and French, the classifier maintains consistently good correlation with labeled grade level (0.63 to 0.79) across all test sets. Some traditional semantic variables such as type-token ratio gave the best performance on commercial calibrated test passages, while our language modeling approach gave better accuracy for Web documents and very short passages (less than 10 words)."

We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy)."

Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful."

Labeled instances however are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there has been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice. \nWe present a series of novel semi-supervised learning approaches arising from a graph representation, where labeled and unlabeled instances are represented as vertices, and edges encode the similarity between instances. They address the following questions: How to use unlabeled data? (label propagation); What is the probabilistic interpretation? (Gaussian fields and harmonic functions); What if we can choose labeled data? (active learning); How to construct good graphs? (hyperparameter learning); How to work with kernel machines like SVM? (graph kernels); How to handle complex data like sequences? (kernel conditional random fields); How to handle scalability and induction? (harmonic mixtures). An extensive literature review is included at the end."

In 10-fold cross-validation experiments using support vector regression, we achieve improvements in mean-squared error over baseline ranging from 57% to 64%."

In a number of categorization tasks including text categorization, negative examples are usually more common than positive examples and there may be several different types of negative examples. Therefore, we construct a TOP kernel, regarding the probabilistic model of negative examples as a mixture of several component models respectively corresponding to given categories. Since each component model of our mixture model is expressed using a one-dimensional Gaussian-type function, the proposed kernel has an advantage in computational time. We also show that the computational advantage is shared by a more general class of models. In our experiments, the proposed kernel used with Support Vector Machines outperformed the linear kernel and the Fisher kernel based on the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing model."

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry: and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two \"related\" objects. We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem. We provide the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric-all distances are the same-our methods provide a 2-approximation."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel way for assessing the affective qualities of natural language and a scenario for its use. Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as \"getting into a car accident\") to classify sentences into \"basic\" emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness implications.Open Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces."

The primary linguistic resource for fuzzy semantic typing is the fuzzy affect lexicon, from which other important resources are generated, notably the fuzzy thesaurus and affect category groups. Free text is tagged with affect categories from the lexicon, and the affect categories' centralities and intensities are combined using techniques from fuzzy logic to produce affect sets fuzzy sets that represent the affect quality of a document. We show different aspects of affect analysis using news stories and movie reviews. Our experiments show a very good correspondence of affect sets with human judgments of affect content. We ascribe this to the effective representation of ambiguity in our fuzzy affect lexicon, and the ability of fuzzy logic to deal successfully with the ambiguity of words in natural language. Planned extensions of the system include personalized profiles for Web-based content dissemination, fuzzy retrieval, clustering and classification."

These models utilize the ordinal nature of the data by describing various modes of stochastic ordering and this eliminates the need for assigning scores or otherwise assuming cardinality instead of ordinality. Two models in particular, the proportional odds and the proportional hazards models are likely to be most useful in practice because of the simplicity of their interpretation. These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation. Applications are discussed with the aid of examples."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

The theory of institutions was named and initially developed by Joseph Goguen and Rod Burstall. This theory, a metatheory based on category theory, regards ontologies as logical theories or local logics. The theory of institutions uses the category-theoretic ideas of fibrations and indexed categories to develop logical theories. Institutions unite the lattice approach of Formal Concept Analysis of Ganter and Wille with the distributed logic of Information Flow of Barwise and Seligman. The institutional approach incorporates locally the lattice of theories idea of Sowa from the theory of knowledge representation. The Information Flow Framework, which was initiated within the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology project, uses the institutional approach in its applied aspect for the comparison, semantic integration and maintenance of ontologies. This chapter explains the central ideas of the institutional approach to ontologies in a careful and detailed manner."
