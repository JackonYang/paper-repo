We describe an algorithm for determining maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of these models. The language models which we present differ from previous models based on stochastic context-free grammars in that they are highly lexical. In particular, they include the familiar $n$-gram models as a natural subclass. The motivation for considering this class is to estimate the contribution which grammar can make to reducing the relative entropy of natural language."

Many important categories, particularly negation and the adverbials, have been entirely ignored, and the treatment of Tense and the affixes is certainly inadequate. It also remains to be seen how the many constructions that have been ignored here are to be accommodated within the framework that has been outlined. However, the fact that a standard categorial lexicon, plus the four rule schemata, seems to come close to exhaustively specifying the main clause constructions of English, and also seems to explain a number of major constraints on transformations, encourages us to compare the theory with certain alternatives, and to examine its broader implications."

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
