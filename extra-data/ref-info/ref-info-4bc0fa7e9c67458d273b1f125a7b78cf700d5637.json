However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines.

The method was motivated by the need for quick and reliable detection of horizontal lines in an interactive drawing conversion system for telephone company drawings. At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths, assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping, both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many false positive lines."
