In this paper, the improved iterative erosion algorithm is proposed to avoid the redundant calculations in the iterative erosion algorithm. Furthermore, to avoid the iterative operations, the two-scan-based algorithm by a deriving approach is developed for achieving EDT correctly and efficiently in a constant time. Besides, we discover when obstacles appear in the image, many algorithms cannot achieve the correct EDT except our two-scan-based algorithm. Moreover, the two-scan-based algorithm does not require the additional cost of preprocessing or relative-coordinates recording."

The first algorithm, which is of primarily theoretical interest, constructs the complete Voronoi diagram. The second, more practical, algorithm constructs the Voronoi diagram where it intersects the horizontal lines passing through the image pixel centers. Extensions to higher dimensional images and to other distance functions are also discussed. >"

The algorithm, which is based on dimensionality reduction and partial Voronoi diagram construction, can be used for computing the DT for a wide class of distance functions, including the L/sub p/ and chamfer metrics. At each dimension level, the DT is computed by constructing the intersection of the Voronoi diagram whose sites are the feature voxels with each row of the image. This construction is performed efficiently by using the DT in the next lower dimension. The correctness and linear time complexity are demonstrated analytically and verified experimentally. The algorithm may be of practical value since it is relatively simple and easy to implement and it is relatively fast (not only does it run in O(N) time but the time constant is small). A simple modification of the algorithm computes the weighted Euclidean DT, which is useful for images with anisotropic voxel dimensions. A parallel version of the algorithm runs in O(N/p) time with p processors."

Chamfer distance transforms are a class of discrete algorithms that offer a good approximation to the desired Euclidean distance transform at a lower computational cost. They can also give integer-valued distances that are more suitable for several digital image processing tasks. The local distances used to compute a chamfer distance transform are selected to minimize an approximation error. A new geometric approach is developed to find optimal local distances. This new approach is easier to visualize than the approaches found in previous work, and can be easily extended to chamfer metrics that use large neighborhoods. A new concept of critical local distances is presented which reduces the computational complexity of the chamfer distance transform without increasing the maximum approximation error."

A sequence of larger neighborhoods is then used to gradually improve this approximation. Computations are kept short by restricting the use of these large neighborhoods to the tile borders in the Voronoi diagram of the image. We assess the computational cost of this new algorithm and show that it is both smaller and less image-dependent than all other DTs recently proposed. Contrary to all other propagation DTs, it appears to remain o(n2) even in the worst-case scenario."

There are many known algorithms and structuring function decompositions to efficiently implement a morphological erosion. Most of the erosion algorithms are classified as parallel, sequential raster (and anti-raster), and propagation. Based on this classification and decomposition, we review and classify most of the DT algorithms reported in the literature. As a result of this study, we have contributed not only to better classify and understand the diversity of the DT algorithms in the literature, but also to create a collection of efficient erosion algorithms suitable to different computer architectures."

Since the computation per row (column) is independent of the computation of other rows (columns), the algorithm can be easily parallelized on shared memory computers. The algorithm can be used for the computation of the exact Euclidean, Manhattan (L 1 norm), and chessboard distance (L \u221e norm) transforms."

The distance transform is an erosion by a structuring function dependent on the distance metric used. To achieve high speed performance, the squared Euclidean distance structuring function is decomposed into a family of four one-dimensional two-point structuring functions. The erosion algorithm is based on a propagation scheme which resulted in an overall Euclidean distance transform algorithm very simple to code and understand, yet with speed performance compared to the Chamfer 3-5-7 sequential raster and anti-raster algorithm."

In this paper, an approach of Distance Map based Image Enhancement (DMIE) is proposed for improving the quality of interpolated images. In DMIE, edge detection is performed after images are interpolated by conventional interpolation schemes. A unified linear-time algorithm for the distance transform is applied to deal with the calculation of Euclidean distance from pixels to edges in the image. The intensities of pixels that are located around edges are adjusted according to the distance to the edges. DMIE produces a visually pleasing sharpening of edges in interpolated images."

The proposed approach operates on pixel or voxel descriptions of objects to be matched and estimates the parameters of a space transformation for optimal alignment of objects. The computational cost of an algorithm developed with this method is estimated. The methodology is tested by developing an algorithm for rigid body transformation alignment of three-dimensional data sets. Tests with synthetic and real objects indicate that the method is accurate, reliable, and robust."

In addition to distance, other properties may be derived from the distance field, such as the direction to the surface, and when the distance field is signed, we may also determine if the point is internal or external to objects within the domain. The distance field has been found to be a useful construction within the areas of computer vision, physics, and computer graphics. This paper serves as an exposition of methods for the production of distance fields, and a review of alternative representations and applications of distance fields. In the course of this paper, we present various methods from all three of the above areas, and we answer pertinent questions such as How accurate are these methods compared to each other? How simple are they to implement?, and What is the complexity and runtime of such methods?."

A significant feature of the algorithm is that it takes segments rather than pixels as the basic units to represent and propagate the nearest neighbor information. The segment lists are dynamically updated as they are scanned. A distance map can then be easily computed from the segment list representation of the Voronoi diagram. Experimental results have demonstrated its high efficiency. Extension of the algorithm to higher dimensions is also discussed."

In addition, other more practically oriented, areas of computer science\u2014 such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, robotics, pattern recognition, and operations research\u2014give rise to problems that inherently are geometrical. This is one reason computational geometry has attracted enormous research interest in the past decade and is a well-established area today. (For standard sources, we refer to the survey article by Lee and Preparata [19841 and to the textbooks by Preparata and Shames [1985] and Edelsbrunner [1987bl.) Readers familiar with the literature of computational geometry will have noticed, especially in the last few years, an increasing interest in a geometrical construct called the Voronoi diagram. This trend can also be observed in combinatorial geometry and in a considerable number of articles in natural science journals that address the Voronoi diagram under different names specific to the respective area. Given some number of points in the plane, their Voronoi diagram divides the plane according to the nearest-neighbor"

In the uniform-cost algorithm, nodes are expanded in order of increasing cost. An efficient version of this algorithm is developed for integer cost values. Nodes are sorted by storing them at predefined places (bucket sort), keeping the overhead low. The algorithm is applied to general distance transformation. A constrained distance transform is an operation which calculates at each pixel of an image the distance to the nearest pixel of a reference set, distance being defined as minimum path length. The uniform-cost algorithm, in the constrained case, proves to be the best solution for distance transformation. It is fast, the processing time is independent of the complexity of the image, and memory requirements are moderate. >"

The author shows that these problems are due to the local way distances are propagated in images by this algorithm. To remedy these drawbacks, an algorithm which encodes the objects boundaries as chains and propagates these structures in the image using rewriting rules is introduced. The chains convey Euclidean distances and can be written above one another, thus yielding exact results. In addition, the proposed algorithm is particularly efficient.

A common approach for generating discrete skeletons takes three steps: 1) computing the distance map, 2) detecting maximal disks from the distance map, and 3) linking the centers of maximal disks (CMDs) into a connected skeleton. Algorithms using approximate distance metrics are abundant and their theory has been well established. However, the resulting skeletons may be inaccurate and sensitive to rotation. In this paper, we study methods for generating skeletons based on the exact Euclidean metric. We first show that no previous algorithms identify the exact set of discrete maximal disks under the Euclidean metric. We then propose new algorithms and show that they are correct. To link CMDs into connected skeletons, we examine two prevalent approaches: connected thinning and steepest ascent. We point out that the connected thinning approach does not work properly for Euclidean distance maps. Only the steepest ascent algorithm produces skeletons that are truly medially placed. The resulting skeletons have all the desirable properties: they have the same simple connectivity as the figure, they are well-centered, they are insensitive to rotation, and they allow exact reconstruction. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated with numerous examples."

The algorithm first calculates the curvature function from the digitized image of an object. The points of local maxima and minima extracted from the smooth curvature are used as control points to segment the boundary and to guide the boundary-matching procedure. The boundary-matching procedure considers two shapes at a time, one shape from the template databank, and the other from the object being classified. The procedure tries to match the control points in the unknown shape to those of a shape from the template databank, and estimates the translation, rotation, and scaling factors to be used to normalize the boundary of the unknown shape. The chamfer 3/4 distance transformation and a partial distance measurement scheme constitute the final step in measuring the similarity between the two shapes. The unknown shape is assigned to the class corresponding to the minimum distance. The algorithm has been successfully tested on partial shapes using two sets of data, one with sharp corners and the other with curve segments. This algorithm not only is computationally simple, but also works reasonably well in the presence of a moderate amount of noise. >"

                "text": "Abstract Subpixel methods that locate curves and their singularities, and that accurately measure geometric quantities, such as orientation and curvature, are of significant importance in computer vision and graphics. Such methods often use local surface fits or structural models for a local neighborhood of the curve to obtain the interpolated curve. Whereas their performance is good in smooth regions of the curve, it is typically poor in the vicinity of singularities. Similarly, the computation of geometric quantities is often regularized to deal with noise present in discrete data. However, in the process, discontinuities are blurred over, leading to poor estimates at them and in their vicinity. In this paper we propose a geometric interpolation technique to overcome these limitations by locating curves and obtaining geometric estimates while (1) not blurring across discontinuities and (2) explicitly and accurately placing them. The essential idea is to avoid the propagation of information across singularities. This is accomplished by a one-sided smoothing technique, where information is propagated from the direction of the side with the \u201csmoother\u201d neighborhood. When both sides are nonsmooth, the two existing discontinuities are relieved by placing a single discontinuity, or shock. The placement of shocks is guided by geometric continuity constraints, resulting in subpixel interpolation with accurate geometric estimates. Since the technique was originally motivated by curve evolution applications, we demonstrate its usefulness in capturing not only smooth evolving curves, but also ones with orientation discontinuities. In particular, the technique is shown to be far better than traditional methods when multiple or entire curves are present in a very small neighborhood."

                "text": "Medical image processing is a demanding domain, both in terms of CPU and memory requirements. The volume of data to be processed is often large (a typical MRI dataset requires 10 MBytes) and many processing tools are only useful to the physician if they are available as real-time applications, i.e. if they run in a few seconds at most. Of course, a large part of these demands are - and will be - handled by the development of more powerful hardware. On the other hand, when faced with non-linear computational complexity, the development of improved algorithms is obviously the best solution. Distance transformations, a powerful image analysis tool used in a number of problems such as image registration, requires such improvements. A distance map is an image where the value of each pixel is the distance from this pixel to the nearest pixel belonging to a given set or object. A distance transformation (DT) is an algorithm that computes a distance map from a binary image representing this set of pixels. This definition is global in the sense that it requires finding the minimum on a set of distances computed between all image pixels and all object pixels. Therefore, a direct application of the definition usually leads to an unacceptable computational complexity. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to localize this definition of distance to the nearest pixel and allow a faster DT computation, but up to now, none of them combines both exactness and linear complexity. Numerous applications of distance transformations to image analysis and pattern recognition have been reported and those related to medical image processing are explored in what follows. Chapter 1 introduces a few basic concepts, a typical application of distance transformations in pattern recognition and the key challenges in producing a DT algorithm. Chapter 2 contains an exhaustive critical review of published algorithms. The strong and weak points of the most popular ones are discussed and the core principles for our original algorithms are derived. Chapters 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 present original distance transformation algorithms. Each of those chapters is organized in a somewhat similar fashion. First we describe the algorithm. Then we evaluate its computational complexity and compare it to the state of the art. Chapter 4, 7, 9 and 11 each present an application to a particular problem in medical image processing, using the algorithm developed in the previous chapter. Ideally, the description of any medical image processing problem should include a medical justification of the need for an automated processing, a complete review of the state of the art in the field, a detailed description of the proposed processing method, and an evaluation of the accuracy of the results and their medical significance. Because of both time and space constraints in this thesis, such an exhaustive work will only be presented for the application in chapter 4, while the other applications will be described more briefly. Chapter 3 describes a new exact Euclidean distance transformation using ordered propagation. It is based on a variation of Ragnelmam's approximate Euclidean DT. We analyze the error patterns for approximate Euclidean DT using finite masks, and we derive a rule defining, for any pixel location, the size of the neighborhood that guarantees the exactness of the DT. This algorithm is particularly well-suited to implement mathematical morphology operations, which are examined in details. In Chapter 4, we apply the algorithm of chapter 3 to the segmentation of neuronal fibers from microscopic images of the sciatic nerve. In particular, it is used to determine the thickness of the myelin sheath surrounding the center of the fiber. This study was carried out in collaboration with the Neural Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory, UCL. Chapter 5 proposes another exact Euclidean distance transformation, based on the explicit computation of the Voronoi division of the image. Possible error locations are detected at the corners of the Voronoi polygons and corrected if needed. This algorithm is shown to be the fastest exact EDT to date. It approaches the theoretical optimal complexity, a CPU time proportional to the number of pixels on which the distance is computed. Chapter 6 investigates how the algorithms of chapters 3 and 5 can be extended to 3 dimensional images. It shows the limitations of both approaches and proposes an hybrid algorithm mixing the method of chapter 5 and Saito's. In Chapter 7, the 3D Euclidean DT is applied to the registration of MR images of the brain where the matching criterion is the distance between the surfaces of similar objects (skin, cortex, ventricular system, ...) in both images. Examples are shown, from projects with the Neuro-physiology Laboratory, UCL, and with the Positron Tomography Laboratory, UCL. Chapter 8 discusses an extension of the distance transformation concept: geodesic distances on non-convex domains. Because geodesic distances are based on the notion of paths, a trade-off has to be introduced between the accuracy with which straight lines are represented and the way curves of the domain are followed. It is shown that, whatever the trade-off chosen, there is an efficient implementation of the geodesic DT by propagation. By back-tracking the geodesic distance propagation, one can find the shortest path between a target and a starting point. In chapter 9, this is used to plan the optimal path for the camera movements in virtual endoscopy, a work done in collaboration with the Surgical Planning Laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Boston. Chapter 10 extends the Euclidean distance transformation from finding the nearest object pixel to finding the k nearest object pixels. It is shown that this can be done with a complexity increasing linearly with k. In Chapter 11, the k-DT is used as a fast implementation of the k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification between different tissue types in multi-modal MR imaging. This is illustrated through the classification of multiple sclerosis lesions from T1-T2 images, provided by the Radiology unit, St-Luc Hospital, UCL, via the Positron Tomography Laboratory, UCL. Finally, a general conclusion is drawn. It reviews the main contributions of the thesis, its applications and explores some new domains in which their applications could also be useful. Ultimately, the publications related to this thesis are briefly reviewed."

A review of watersheds and related motion is first presented, and the major methods to determine watersheds are discussed. The algorithm is based on an immersion process analogy, in which the flooding of the water in the picture is efficiently simulated using of queue of pixel. It is described in detail provided in a pseudo C language. The accuracy of this algorithm is proven to be superior to that of the existing implementations, and it is shown that its adaptation to any kind of digital grid and its generalization to n-dimensional images (and even to graphs) are straightforward. The algorithm is reported to be faster than any other watershed algorithm. Applications of this algorithm with regard to picture segmentation are presented for magnetic resonance (MR) imagery and for digital elevation models. An example of 3-D watershed is also provided. >"

Both methods use ordered propagation, i.e. iterative propagation via contour pixels. However, we restrict the propagation to unique shortest Euclidean paths, the sufficient propagation paths. Moreover, we ensure error-free direct pixel update by adding a distance suggestion to each propagation pixel. Using these ideas, we avoid many unneccesary calculations. The computational tests show that our algorithms, used as signed and as unsigned methods, are significantly faster than other well-known signed and unsigned EDTs. Comparing both methods, sufficientd\u221e-propagation yields the better average performance."

The acceleration of this class of algorithms is achieved by skipping empty macro regions, which are defined for each background voxel of the volume. Background voxels are labeled in a preprocessing phase by a value, defining the macro region size, which is equal to the voxel distance to the nearest foreground voxel. The CD algorithm exploits the chessboard distance and defines the ray as a nonuniform sequence of samples positioned at voxel faces. This feature assures that no foreground voxels are missed during the scene traversal. Further, due to parallelepipedal shape of the macro region, it supports accelerated visualization of cubic, regular, and rectilinear grids. The CD algorithm is suitable for all modifications of the ray tracing/ray casting techniques being used in volume visualization and volume graphics. However, when used for rendering based on local surface interpolation, it also enables fast search of intersections between rays and the interpolated surface, further improving speed of the process."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

One central problem is to find an efficient and effective approach to search for the best matching between two image sets. In contrast to the conventional matching techniques, the innovation of our method detailed in this paper is to propose a hierarchical Chamfer matching scheme based on the dynamic detection of interesting points. The algorithm extends the traditional methods by introducing interesting points to replace edge points in distance transform for the matching measurement. The search for the best matching is guided by minimizing a given matching criterion in an interesting points pyramid from coarse level to fine level. The pyramid is created through a dynamic thresholding scheme and such a hierarchical structure aims to reduce the computation load. The processing speed is further improved by parallel implementation on a low cost heterogeneous PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) network without specific software and hardware requirements. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is simple to implement and quite insensitive to noise and other disturbances with reliability and efficiency."

Some usually desirable characteristics of a skeleton are: sufficient for the reconstruction of the original object, centered, thin and homotopic. The Euclidean Medial Axis presents all these characteristics in a continuous framework. In the discrete case, the Exact Euclidean Medial Axis (MA) is also sufficient for reconstruction and centered. It no longer preserves homotopy but it can be combined with a homotopic thinning to generate homotopic skeletons. The thinness of the MA, however, may be discussed. In this paper we present the definition of the Exact Euclidean Medial Axis on Higher Resolution which has the same properties as the MA but with a better thinness characteristic, against the price of rising resolution. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute it."

Relationships between them, with respect to polygons, had been noted decades ago, and recently this was extended for a broader class of shapes. More specifically, Voronoi diagrams have been considered as a means through which optimal computational geometry algorithms can be applied for performing symmetry axis calculation. This paper is aimed at establishing a closer theoretical relation between Voronoi diagrams and medial axes. Extensions of the definitions of these concepts are proposed, and the advantages of these definitions with respect to some specific but relevant cases are highlighted. In addition, medial axes are characterized as a particular case of Voronoi diagrams, and the implications of this fact are discussed."

Inference algorithms based on graph cuts and belief propagation have been found to yield accurate results, but despite recent advances are often too slow for practical use. In this paper we present some algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the loopy belief propagation approach. One of the techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as image restoration that have a large label set. Another technique speeds up and reduces the memory requirements of belief propagation on grid graphs. A third technique is a multi-grid method that makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In practice we obtain results that are as accurate as those of other global methods (e.g., using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being nearly as fast as purely local methods."

To show the validity of this method, the authors concentrated on an application that involves forming scale-space image of a 2-D shape using morphological opening filtering. A proof is given to show that morphological opening filtering has a property of not introducing additional zero-crossings as one moves to a coarser scale. This is a different result from the conclusion by A.L. Yuille and T.A. Poggio (ibid., vol.PAMI-8, Jan. 1986) that the Gaussian filter is the only filter with this property. In addition, opening filtering is computationaly simpler than the Gaussian filter. >"

DT has been used in path planning for indoor robot research and can also be used to perform obstacle avoidance simultaneously. However, when it comes to outdoor robot navigation, the operating environment becomes too large and DT becomes inefficient when performing both the tasks of path planning and obstacle avoidance. Usually both tasks have to be decoupled and DT is normally only used for path planning. The newly proposed DT methodology solves this problem by optimising the DT algorithm and reducing the processing area. Simulation and actual tests had also been carried out on an autonomous mobile robot to verify that the DT methodology can integrate both the tasks of path planning and obstacle avoidance and yield encouraging results in outdoor navigation."

This technique is used first to remove the background noise from the image and then to operate a segmentation of the nuclei of the cells and an analysis of their shape, their size and their texture.

The known processes of early vision are spatially restricted (or local) operations, and little is known about their interactions in organizing the visual image into functionally coherent (or global) objects. Here we introduce a human psychophysical method which allows us to measure the effect of perceptual organization on the activity pattern of local visual detectors. We map differential contrast sensitivity for a target across regions enclosed by a boundary. We show that local contrast sensitivity is enhanced within the boundary even for large distances between the boundary and the target. Furthermore, the locations of maximal sensitivity enhancement in the sensitivity maps are determined by global shape properties. Our data support a class of models which describe shapes by the means of a medial axis transformation1\u20133, implying that the visual system extracts \u2018skeletons\u2019 as an intermediate-level representation of objects. The skeletal representation offers a structurally simplified shape description which can be used for higher-level operations and for coding into memory."

In order to speed up the level set evolution procedures, we first introduce a new initialization algorithm based on the vector distance transform, which propagates a vector with a position of the nearest object pixel instead of the scalar distance. A new sign map labeling method, based on the flood fill, is proposed to distinguish the inside and outside of the 2D closed active contour. The active contour model proposed by Chan and Vese (Chan and Vese, 2001) can detect object whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient. Our additional contribution to this paper is to present a further improvement to C-V model by replacing /spl delta/(/spl Phi/) with |/spl nabla//spl Phi/| to gain the global optimization. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed model by experimental results."

In order to speed up the level set evolution procedures, we first introduce a new initialization algorithm based on the vector distance transform, which propagates a vector with a position of the nearest object pixel instead of the scalar distance. A new sign map labeling method, based on the flood fill, is proposed to distinguish the inside and outside of the 2D closed active contour. The active contour model proposed by Chan and Vese (Chan and Vese, 2001) can detect object whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient. Our additional contribution to this paper is to present a further improvement to C-V model by replacing /spl delta/(/spl Phi/) with |/spl nabla//spl Phi/| to gain the global optimization. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed model by experimental results."

Once such a parameterization has been performed, rays can be traversed in steps across inverted cones of empty space rather than across successive height field grid cells. As the cone opening angles increase, ray tracing efficiency tends to improve because steps along rays across the inverted cones get longer. Circular horizontal cross-sections of an inverted cone can be divided into contiguous nonoverlapping sectors. Given that the inverted cones can contain nothing but empty space, the maximum possible opening angle within any such sector may significantly exceed the opening angle of the inverted cone. It is shown that ray tracing efficiency can be significantly improved by replacing the inverted cones of empty space with cones that have narrow sectors. It is also known that the parameters of the inverted cones can be derived from distance transforms (DTs) of successive horizontal cross-sections of the height field. Each cross-section can be represented as a 2D binary array, whose DT gives the distance from each element to the nearest element of value 1. DTs can be directionalized by requiring the element of value 1 closest to a given element to lie within a sector emanating from that given element. The parameters of inverted cones within specific sectors can be derived from such directional DTs. An efficient new algorithm for generating directional DTs is introduced."

This approach is a combination of analytic computations in the style of computational geometry and discrete propagations on a grid in the style of the numerical solutions of PDE's. Specifically, waves from each of the initial curve segments are initialized and propagated as a discrete wavefront along discrete directions. In addition, to avoid error built up due to the discrete nature of propagation, shockwaves are detected and explicitly propagated along a secondary dynamic grid. The propagation of shockwaves, integrated with the propagation of the wavefront along discrete directions, leads to an exact simulation of propagation by the Eikonal equation. The resulting symmetries are simply the collection of shockwaves formed in this process which can be manipulated locally, exactly, and efficiently under local changes in an edge map (gap completion, removal of spurious elements, etc). The ability to express grouping operations in the language of symmetry maps makes it an appropriate intermediate representation between low-level edge maps and high level object hypotheses."

This CDTNN has many good properties as the conventional distance transforms, which are suitable for 3-D object representation and deformation estimation. We have successfully represented the 3-D epicardia and endocardia of left ventricles using CDTNNs trained by as few as 7.5% of the manually traced data. The mean absolute error in the testing for one patient over the 27 testing planes were (1.4 \u00b1 1.2 mm) for the endocardium, (1.3 \u00b1 1.0 mm) for the epicardium at end diastole and (1.4 \u00b1 1.2 mm) for the endocardium vs. 1.2 \u00b1 1.0 mm for the epicardium at end systole. The absolute error measured compares favorably with the human inter-observer variability reported for analyzing distances. With this unique distance transform representation that is continuous and differentiable, we are also able to systematically and effectively measure the amount of 3-D heart motion in terms of affine transform."

Now place this movable strip alongside the observation vector so that the top element on the paper strip is opposite the top element of the observation vector. Multiply adjacent elements and write the sum of these products at the top of a new column. Now slide the paper strip down t, spaces. Form the indicated inner product as before and write the result in the new column below the previous entry. Continue in this manner until all the observations have been used. Now write row two of MD on a strip of paper and proceed as before. If we continue this process with all the rows of Mn we will get a new vector zn whose elements are linear transformations of the observation vector y, The dimension of z,, is the same as that of y. Similarly form znBl from Zn and &-I . Continuing this process we finally obtain z1 = z which is the desired interaction vector. In all the foregoing we used the normalized contrast matrices; thus the sums of squares are the squares of the elements of z. For hand computation, one might prefer using the unnormalized contrast matrices, since their elements are integers. But then we need a vector of divisors; it is obtained by performing the same operations on a column of ones as on y, except that we use the squares of the elements of the contrast matrices. Then the ith sum of squares equals 2; 2 divided by the corresponding divisor. This method might be called a \u201cpaper strip method\u201d for analysis of variance and is similar to paper strip methods used for operations with polynomials.

The size, number and anatomical features of individual cells were measured automatically using methods based on image skeletonization and the distance transform. The variation in cell wall thickness around individual cells was measured by masking the distance transform of a segmented binary cell wall image with a skeleton of the same image to extract distance values along the boundary between neighbouring cells. The measurements were used to create a multi-dimensional feature space in which individual cells were classified automatically according to their tissue type. Cells were classified into seven types using discriminant analysis, and the performance of the classification rule was examined by cross-validation. The potential use of these methods as a research tool, and in plant breeding programmes is discussed. # 1996 Annals of Botany Company"

In software development, the analogy to mass is objects and the analogy to force is operations, or algorithms. The term \"object-oriented\" means various things to different groups of software developers. To some it may imply the use of a particular object-oriented programming language, like Smalltalk, Actor, or C++. To others it could mean the step before system implementation, or coding, in the software development process, an object-oriented approach to design. Object-oriented purists may view this book as one on object-based programming, using object-oriented analysis and design with implementation in Ada 95. In any case, whether we call it objectoriented or object-based, the approach transcends the specifics in any particular programming language.

We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for external storage and memory management. As a consequence, this book should be suitable as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume is familiarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal."

(A tree is a graph with one and only one path between every two nodes.) In the course of the construction that we present here, the branches are subdivided into three sets: I. the branches definitely assignec~ to the tree under construction (they will form a subtree) ; II. the branches from which the next branch to be added to set I, will be selected ; III. the remaining branches (rejected or not yet considered). The nodes are subdivided into two sets: A. the nodes connected by the branches of set I, B. the remaining nodes (one and only one branch of set II will lead to each of these nodes), We start the construction by choosing an arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all branches that end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From then onwards we perform the following two steps repeatedly. Step 1. The shortest branch of set II is removed from this set and added to"

The purpose of this study was to compare quantitative perfusion CT imaging and qualitative diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI and PWI) in acute stroke patients at the time of their emergency evaluation. Methods\u2014 Thirteen acute stroke patients underwent perfusion CT and DWI or PWI on admission. The size of infarct and ischemic lesion (infarct plus penumbra) on the admission perfusion CT was compared with that of the MR abnormalities as shown on the DWI trace and on the relative cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, time to peak, and mean transit time maps calculated from PWI studies. Results\u2014 The most significant correlation was found between infarct size on the admission perfusion CT and abnormality size on the admission DWI map (r =0.968, P <0.001). A significant correlation was also observed between the size of the ischemic lesion (infarct plus penumbra) on the admission perfusion CT and the abnormality size on the mean transit time map calculated from admission PWI (r =0.946, P <0.001). Information about cerebral infarct and total ischemia (infarct plus penumbra) carried by both imaging techniques was similar, with slopes of 0.913 and 0.905, respectively. Conclusions\u2014 An imaging technique may be helpful in the identification of cerebral penumbra in acute stroke patients and thus in the selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy. Perfusion CT and DWI/PWI are equivalent in this task."

                "text": "Most of us have gotten accustomed to the idea of using the notation O(f(n)) to stand for any function whose magnitude is upper-bounded by a constant times f(n) , for all large n. Sometimes we also need a corresponding notation for lower-bounded functions, i.e., those functions which are at least as large as a constant times f(n) for all large n. Unfortunately~ people have occasionally been using the O-notation for lower bounds, for example when they reject a particular sorting method \"because its running time is O(n 2) \" I have seen instances of this in print quite of tent and finally it has prompted me to sit down and write a Letter to the Editor about the situation. The classical literature does have a notation for functions that are bounded below, namely ~(f(n)). The most prominent appearance of this notation is in Titchmarsh's magnum opus on Riemann's zeta function [8], where he defines ~(f(n)) on p. 152 and devotes his entire Chapter 8 to \"~-theorems\". See also Karl Prachar's Primzahlverteilung [7], P. 245. The ~ notation has not become very common, although I have noticed its use in a few places, most recently in some Russian publications I consulted about the theory of equidistributed sequences. Once I had suggested to someone in a letter that he use ~-notation \"since it had been used by number theorists for years\"; but later, when challenged to show explicit references, I spent a surprisingly fruitless hour searching in the library without being able to turn up a single reference. I have recently asked several prominent mathematicians if they knew what ~(n 2) meant, and more than half of them had never seen the notation before. Before writing this letter, I decided to search more carefully, and to study the history of O-notation and o-notation as well. Cajori's two-volume work on history of mathematical notations does not mention any of these. While looking for definitions of ~ I came across dozens of books from the early part of this century which defined O and o but not ~ ."
