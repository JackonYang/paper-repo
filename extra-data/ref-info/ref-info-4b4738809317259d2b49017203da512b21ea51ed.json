The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Each key-frame is then analyzed for its text content. Text spotting is performed by scanning the image with a variable-size window (to account for scale) within which simple features (mean/variance of grayscale values and x/y derivatives) are extracted in various sub-areas. Training builds classifiers using the most discriminant spatial combinations of features for text detection. The text-spotting module outputs a decision map of the size of the input key-frame showing regions of interest that may contain text suitable for recognition by an OCR system. Performance is measured against a dataset of 147 key-frames extracted from 22 documentary films of the National Film Board (NFB) of Canada. A detection rate of 97% is obtained with relatively few false alarms."

Traditional systems in this area have relied on elaborate models incorporating carefully hand-engineered features or large amounts of prior knowledge. In this paper, we take a different route and combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

Previous methods addressed this problem by first detecting individual characters, and then forming them into words. Such approaches often suffer from weak character detections, due to large intra-class variations, even more so than characters from scanned documents. We take a different view of the problem and present a holistic word recognition framework. In this, we first represent the scene text image and synthetic images generated from lexicon words using gradient-based features. We then recognize the text in the image by matching the scene and synthetic image features with our novel weighted Dynamic Time Warping (wDTW) approach. We perform experimental analysis on challenging public datasets, such as Street View Text and ICDAR 2003. Our proposed method significantly outperforms our earlier work in Mishra et al. (CVPR 2012), as well as many other recent works, such as Novikova et al. (ECCV 2012), Wang et al. al.(ICPR 2012), Wang et al.(ICCV 2011)."

Contrary to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem. We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list. (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it."

The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems.

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

We do so by leveraging the recently introduced Maxout networks along with hybrid HMM models that have proven useful for voice recognition. Using these elements, we build a tunable and highly accurate recognition system that beats state-of-the-art results on all the sub-problems for both the ICDAR 2003 and SVT benchmark datasets."

In this paper we aim to draw attention to text as a readily available source of semantic information in robotics by implementing a system which allows robots to read visible text in natural scene images and to use this knowledge to interpret the content of a given scene. The reliable detection and parsing of text in natural scene images is an active area of research and remains a non-trivial problem. We extend a commonly adopted approach based on boosting for the detection and optical character recognition (OCR) for the parsing of text by a probabilistic error correction scheme incorporating a sensor-model for our pipeline. In order to interpret the scene content we introduce a generative model which explains spotted text in terms of arbitrary search terms. This allows the robot to estimate the relevance of a given scene with respect to arbitrary queries such as, for example, whether it is looking at a bank or a restaurant. We present results from images recorded by a robot in a busy cityscape."

On the Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art. The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset.

Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification, we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern data center-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency, mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android."

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

Our approach combines local likelihood and pairwise positional consistency priors with higher order priors that enforce consistency of characters (lexicon) and their attributes (font and colour). Unlike traditional stage-based methods, word recognition in our framework is performed by estimating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution under the joint posterior distribution of the model. MAP inference in our model is performed through the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). We show how the efficiency of certain operations on WFSTs can be utilized to find the most likely word under the model in an efficient manner. We evaluate our method on a range of challenging datasets (ICDAR'03, SVT, ICDAR'11). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cropped word recognition."

Thanks to effective pruning, it is able to exhaustively search the space of all character sequences in real time (200ms on a 640x480 image). The method exploits higher-order properties of text such as word text lines. We demonstrate that the grouping stage plays a key role in the text localization performance and that a robust and precise grouping stage is able to compensate errors of the character detector. The method includes a novel selector of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) which exploits region topology. Experimental validation shows that 95.7% characters in the ICDAR dataset are detected using the novel selector of MSERs with a low sensitivity threshold. The proposed method was evaluated on the standard ICDAR 2003 dataset where it achieved state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition."

The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearest-neighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition."

(2) Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. (3) The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with an character classifier; text candidates with high probabilities are then eliminated and finally texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition dataset and a publicly available multilingual dataset; the f measures are over 76% and 74% which are significantly better than the state-of-the-art performances of 71% and 65%, respectively."

While traditional document processing often faces challenges such as unusual fonts, noise, and unconstrained lexicons, scene text reading amplifies these challenges and introduces new ones such as motion blur, curved layouts, perspective projection, and occlusion among others. Reading scene text is a complex problem involving many details that must be handled effectively for robust, accurate results. In this work, we describe and evaluate a reading system that combines several pieces, using probabilistic methods for coarsely binarizing a given text region, identifying baselines, and jointly performing word and character segmentation during the recognition process. By using scene context to recognize several words together in a line of text, our system gives state-of-the-art performance on three difficult benchmark data sets."

In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over $96\\%$ accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving $97.84\\%$ accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over $90\\%$ accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a $99.8\\%$ accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators."

Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges.

Therefore, video text can be used as a valuable source for automated video indexing in digital video libraries. In this paper, we propose a workflow for video text detection and recognition. In the text detection stage, we have developed a fast localization-verification scheme, in which an edge-based multi-scale text detector first identifies potential text candidates with high recall rate. Then, detected candidate text lines are refined by using an image entropy-based filter. Finally, Stroke Width Transform (SWT)- and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based verification procedures are applied to eliminate the false alarms. For text recognition, we have developed a novel skeleton-based binarization method in order to separate text from complex backgrounds to make it processible for standard OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. Operability and accuracy of proposed text detection and binarization methods have been evaluated by using publicly available test data sets."

In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust method for detecting texts in natural scene images. A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and clustering threshold are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with a character classifier; text candidates with high non-text probabilities are eliminated and texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition database; the f-measure is over 76%, much better than the state-of-the-art performance of 71%. Experiments on multilingual, street view, multi-orientation and even born-digital databases also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Text detection is the most crucial step in a multimedia text extraction system and although it has been extensively studied the past decade still, it does not exist a generic architecture that would work for artificial and scene text in multimedia content. In this paper we propose a system for text detection of both artificial and scene text in images and video frames. The system is based on a machine learning stage which uses an Random Forest classifier and a highly discriminative feature set produced by using a new texture operator called Multilevel Adaptive Color edge Local Binary Pattern (MACeLBP). MACeLBP describes the spatial distribution of color edges in multiple adaptive levels of contrast. Then, a gradient-based algorithm is applied to achieve distinction among text lines as well as refinement in the localization of the text lines. The whole algorithm is situated in a multiresolution framework to achieve invariance to scale for the detection of text lines. Finally, an optional connected-component step segments text lines into words based on the distances between the resulting components. The experimental results are produced by applying a concise evaluation methodology and prove the superior performance achieved by the proposed text detection system for artificial and scene text in images and video frames."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

In our paper, a novel method for text detection in natural scene image is suggested using edge detection, maximally stable extremal region (MSER) and tensor voting. Edge detection and MSER methods are combined to find the greatest character candidates from stable areas which are extracted from an input image. These text candidates are used to extract the text line information using tensor voting that creates normal vectors and curve saliency values in characters along the text lines. Therefore, the text line information is used to eliminate non-text areas. Our method is evaluated on the ICDAR2013 datasets and experiment results show that the proposed result is compared to the previous methods."

OCRs have considerably good performance on good quality documents, but fail easily in presence of degradations. Also, classical OCR approaches perform poorly over complex scripts such as those for Indian languages. We address these issues by proposing to recognize character n-gram images, which are basically groupings of consecutive character/component segments. Our approach is unique, since we use the character n-grams as a primitive for recognition rather than for post processing. By exploiting the additional context present in the character n-gram images, we enable better disambiguation between confusing characters in the recognition phase. The labels obtained from recognizing the constituent n-grams are then fused to obtain a label for the word that emitted them. Our method is inherently robust to degradations such as cuts and merges which are common in digital libraries of scanned documents. We also present a reliable and scalable scheme for recognizing character n-gram images. Tests on English and Malayalam document images show considerable improvement in recognition in the case of heavily degraded documents."

At the same time, a growing amount of images and videos are being shared on the Internet. This dissertation tries to combine these developments in proposing efficient retrieval and mining algorithms suitable for such visual data, while exploiting its multimodal context. The work at hand advances the state-of-the-art with three main contributions. Firstly, with the investigation of itemset mining algorithms in the domain of visual data. This class of simple, but efficient algorithms have proven to be a useful tool for other kinds of data. We adapt these methods to work with local visual features. The resulting algorithms are successfully employed to mine specific objects in video data, and to identify frequent feature configurations as representatives of object classes. The second contribution consists of a multimodal data-mining method, which automatically mines objects and events from community photo collections on the Internet. After crawling geotagged photos, the method automatically clusters photos showing the same object or event using visual features. The system then proceeds with analyzing the multimodal context of each identified cluster, in particular text associated with the individual photos. This analysis results in a textual description of the clusters. Furthermore, it is used to identify related Wikipedia pages. Finally, building again on the mined visual data, this assignment is verified, and refined up to an object-level annotation of mined entities for applications such as retrieval or auto-annotation. The third and final contribution consist of several prototype applications for scalable retrieval in visual data, partly building on the data mined in the previous steps. These retrieval applications focus on applications for"

We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise segmentations, by leveraging existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes that are already segmented. Through an experiment on 577 classes and 500k images we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently; (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut [1] initialized on the image center, as well as our recent segmentation transfer technique [2] on which this paper is based. Moreover, our method also delivers state-of-the-art results on the recent iCoseg dataset for co-segmentation."

However, locating text from a complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework of text string detection consists of two steps: 1) image partition to find text character candidates based on local gradient features and color uniformity of character components and 2) character candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features of text characters in each text string such as character size differences, distances between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms of text string detection: 1) adjacent character grouping method and 2) text line grouping method. The adjacent character grouping method calculates the sibling groups of each character candidate as string segments and then merges the intersecting sibling groups into text string. The text line grouping method performs Hough transform to fit text line among the centroids of text candidates. Each fitted text line describes the orientation of a potential text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region covering all characters whose centroids are cascaded in its text line. To improve efficiency and accuracy, our algorithms are carried out in multi-scales. The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art results on the public Robust Reading Dataset, which contains text only in horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our methods to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations is evaluated on the Oriented Scene Text Dataset collected by ourselves containing text strings in nonhorizontal orientations."

To evaluate the performance of recent algorithms in detecting and recognizing text from complex images, the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition was organized. Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance."

Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern GPUs. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a significant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a GPU architecture and addresses a number of related challenges."

We consider two visualisation techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the input image. The first one generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan et al., 2009], thus visualising the notion of the class, captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets. Finally, we establish the connection between the gradient-based ConvNet visualisation methods and deconvolutional networks [Zeiler et al., 2013]."

While delivering impressive results across a range of computer vision and machine learning tasks, these networks are computationally demanding, limiting their deployability. Convolutional layers generally consume the bulk of the processing time, and so in this work we present two simple schemes for drastically speeding up these layers. This is achieved by exploiting cross-channel or filter redundancy to construct a low rank basis of filters that are rank-1 in the spatial domain. Our methods are architecture agnostic, and can be easily applied to existing CPU and GPU convolutional frameworks for tuneable speedup performance. We demonstrate this with a real world network designed for scene text character recognition [15], showing a possible 2.5\u00d7 speedup with no loss in accuracy, and 4.5\u00d7 speedup with less than 1% drop in accuracy, still achieving state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

In this paper, we propose a novel text detection algorithm, which employs edge-enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Regions as basic letter candidates. These candidates are then filtered using geometric and stroke width information to exclude non-text objects. Letters are paired to identify text lines, which are subsequently separated into words. We evaluate our system using the ICDAR competition dataset and our mobile document database. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

In this paper, we show that formulating the problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework makes such preprocessing unnecessary and produces an algorithm that is simple, efficient, and robust. Furthermore, it scales well to handle large number of classes. To recognize the patches surrounding keypoints, our classifier uses hundreds of simple binary features and models class posterior probabilities. We make the problem computationally tractable by assuming independence between arbitrary sets of features. Even though this is not strictly true, we demonstrate that our classifier nevertheless performs remarkably well on image datasets containing very significant perspective changes."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques.

Given an ability to obtain local low-level data evidence on primitive elements of a structure (like window in a facade image), we determine their most probable number, attribute values (location, size) and neighborhood relation. The embedded structure is weakly modeled by pair-wise attribute constraints, which allow structure and attribute constraints to mutually support each other. We use a very general framework of reversible jump MCMC, which allows simple implementation of a specific structure model and plug-in of almost arbitrary element classifiers. The MC controls the classifier by prescribing it \"where to look\", without wasting too much time on unpromising locations. \n \nWe have chosen the domain of window recognition in facade images to demonstrate that the result is an efficient algorithm achieving performance of other strongly informed methods for regular structures like grids, while our general model covers loosely regular configurations as well."

The descriptor is rotationally invariant and blur insensitive, which provides great benefits for various applications that suffer from out-of-focus content or involve fast moving or shaking cameras. We employ an Undecimated Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (UDT-CWT) [1] to extract texture features. As the UDT-CWT fully provides local spatial relationship between scales and subband orientations, we can straightforwardly create bit-planes of the images representing local phases of wavelet coefficients. We also discard some of the finest decomposition levels where are most affected by the blur. A histogram of the resulting code words is created and used as features in texture classification. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 40% for synthetic blurs and up to 30% for natural video content due to camera motion when walking."

The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition.

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example.
