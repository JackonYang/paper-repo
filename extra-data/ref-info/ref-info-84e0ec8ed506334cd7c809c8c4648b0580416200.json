Automatic processing is activation of a learned sequence of elements in long-term memory that is initiated by appropriate inputs and then proceeds automatically\u2014without subject control, without stressing the capacity limitations of the system, and without necessarily demanding attention. Controlled processing is a temporary activation of a sequence of elements that can be set up quickly and easily but requires attention, is capacity-limited (usually serial in nature), and is controlled by the subject. A series of studies using both reaction time and accuracy measures is presented, which traces these concepts in the form of automatic detection and controlled, search through the areas of detection, search, and attention. Results in these areas are shown to arise from common mechanisms. Automatic detection is shown to develop following consistent mapping of stimuli to responses over trials. Controlled search is utilized in varied-mapping paradigms, and in our studies, it takes the form of serial, terminating search. The approach resolves a number of apparent conflicts in the literature."

In this model the time to complete any one comparison is distributed exponentially with a rate constant that depends on the number of current items undergoing processing. When any item completes comparison, the rates are immediately readjusted. Such models almost completely mimic serial models. The same set-size predictions are derived as for serial models, whether or not termination of search is assumed. There are some minor problems with these models. For example, the exponential assumption implies a particular relation between the growth of the mean reaction time and the growth of the variance of the reaction time, with set size. More important, however, this sort of parallel model is not conceptually very different from the serial models\u2014comparisons occur, on the average, at evenly spaced intervals of time for each of the items of the memory set (or the display set). We prefer, therefore, to think of such models as members of a class also containing the serial models. As Sternberg (1966) has shown, some types of parallel models, in which each item is processed independently of the number of alternative items, cannot predict the observed results."

Iii the present experiment, these variables were reinvestigated using vocal reaction time as the dependent variable. An interpretation of the accuracy measures in terms of differential processing times was supported. The results of the two experiments were discussed in terms of a model of attentional selectivity."

This paper outlines experimental techniques designed to separate these components and examine their interrelations within comparable tasks. It is shown that a stimulus may be used to increase alertness for processing all external information, to improve selection of particular stimuli, or to do both simultaneously. Development of alertness and selectivity are separable, but they may go on together without interference. Moreover, encoding a stimulus may proceed without producing interference with other signals. Thus, the contact between an external stimulus and its representation in memory does not appear to require processing capacity. Limited capacity results are obtained when mental operations such as response selection or rehearsal must be performed on the encoded information."

Data were obtained in a forced-choice visual detection situation, the displays being linear arrays of letters on a CRT screen. For all three performance measures used, frequency of correct detections and correct and error latencies, strong interactions were obtained between all of the other variables and signal-noise confusability. The functions obtained, together with other data bearing on the role of confusions and on spatial relations among characters within the display, suggest a model whose initial phase is a parallel feature extraction process involving inhibitory relations among input channels."

In both, the four locations containing the information to be detected were presented either simultaneously or sequentially, with the presentation time per location identical for both conditions. Limitations of capacity and attentional control of perceptual processing would predict sequential presentation to be superior to simultaneous presentation, since, in the former case, attention need not be shared among four locations. The results showed equal detection performance for both conditions. Thus, spatial attention was not present during detection of horizontal and vertical dot pairs (Experiment I). O differences (probably due to strategies) make the same conclusion more difficult to draw for single-dot detection (Experiment II). Similar findings and conclusions were reported by Shiffrin and Gardner (1972) in studies utilizing alphabetic characters."

While the major interest has been in the decreasing accuracy of reporting the element as the indicator is increasingly delayed, an equally important problem is the ability of these indicators to selectively determine attention in a matter of milliseconds. The present experiments determined the efficiency of selective attention as a function of the number of elements in the display and the physical spacing between adjacent elements. The results are interpreted in terms of an attentional focusing process. The technique introduced by Averbach and Coriell for studying visual information or iconic storage has proven quite fruitful.' Essentially it consists of presenting simultaneously an overload of letters or numbers in a brief tachistoscopic exposure and then subsequently presenting a probe, or indicator, that designates one element or subset of elements about which the subject is to report. Even though a large number of letters may be simultaneously presented, if the probe occurs within 100-200 msec. following the display the subject can report with high accuracy the designated letter. The generally accepted interpretation of this result is that while the display as a whole may greatly exceed the subject's capacity to process, he can-if the probe occurs before the icon of the display has decayed beyond intelligibility-use his available processing capacity to selectively process the designated element or subset of elements. While the technique has been used primarily to study characterReceived for publication May 12, 1970.

What does this volume convey that is truly unique, considering the recent proliferation of such books? Most happily, there is much that is unique, and this volume is in no sense another redundant and tired repetition of past reviews of the literature. Perhaps its most distinguishing characteristic is its approach to methodological issues and its emphasis on the commonalities \"between human performance and human cognition aspects of information processing\" (p. ix) rather than on the differences between these two approaches. As the editor says in his preface, \"the tutorial style is aimed at two audiences.\" Graduate students who have yet to select an area of specialization should find the broad coverage an aid to this end. Sophisticated researchers who wish to learn more about a particular area of human information processing sufficiently removed from their own speciality that obtaining this information from a search of the literature might prove tedious should also find this volume helpful. Both groups should benefit from the heavy emphasis on methodology that is present throughout the volume. Thus, this book should protect the researcher who is new to an area or an approach from repeating some of the errors that have been noted by the authors. The first chapter, \"Human Perceptual-Motor Performance\" by Richard W. Pew, addresses first the properties and performance of rather mechanistic and \"simple-minded error-correction systems.\" Issues such as the tracking of random signals and a simple model of compensatory tracking are discussed and examined critically and incisively. This develops naturally into a treatment of the relationship between discrete and continuous models of tracking performance. Finally, various higher-order mechanisms in tracking are then offered, sources of signal predictability are outlined, and sine-wave tracking is given as an example, with the overall analysis described in terms of the 'block diagram' that by now is all too familiar. Approximately midway through Pew's treatment, his concern shifts from tracking performance per se to a deep and fundamental understanding of the acquisition and performance of so-called voluntary movements. Perhaps Pew's most penetrating analysis of these issues is of the different roles played by memory in tracking performance versus voluntary movement. His discussion of motor memory is highly illuminating, and his discussion of schema learning as introduced by Bartlett and its relation to problems of motor memory is exceptional. Pew's overall analysis results in another block diagram that summarizes his thinking on 'voluntary' motor control. He concludes that \"while a great deal of detail remains to be worked out, the main thrust of this chapter is that there is nothing incompatible among the representations of inner-loop control, higher-order tracking control, and the formulation and execution of so-called voluntary movements\" (p. 36). Chapter 2, \"The Interpretation of Reaction Time in Information-Processing Research\" by Robert G. Pachella, is not only exceedingly timely but an excep695"

Fourteen specific hypotheses about the time course of this process were derived from various theories (Anderson, 1973; Anderson & Bower, 1973; Baddeley & Ecob, 1973; Corballis, Kirby, & Miller, 1972; Kirsner, 1972; Murdock, 1971; Sternberg, 1966, 1969; Theios, Smith, Haviland, Traupmann, & Moy, 1973; etc.) and additional assumptions about the effect of the response signal. When members of the to-be-learned lists are drawn from a small population of highly confusable items, as in the current experiment, list membership recognition appears to follow the model of Theios et al. (1973). Latency functions of signal lag appear to be particularly useful in differentiating among hypotheses which predict similar speed-accuracy tradeoff functions. The lag by positive-negative interaction for latencies of correct responses is highly significant for lists of one consonant, a result predicted by the hypothesis derived from the model of Theios et al. and incompatible with hypotheses derived from exhaustive search and single-threshold strength models."

The first two experiments utilized a simultaneous-successive comparison. The simultaneous procedure involved simultaneous monitoring of all three sensory modalities for the presence of a near-threshold stimulus. The successive condition allowed S to give his full attention to each sensory modality in turn. There was no advantage for the successive condition, whether the task consisted of detection of a single stimulus (Experiment I) or detection of the absence of one of many stimuli (Experiment II). Experiment III used a different paradigm to extend these results and bridge the gap between these results, those of Eijkman and Vendrik (1965), and those of Moray (1973a, b). We concluded that selective allocation of attention to sensory modalities does not affect the early stages of perceptual processing."

Assuming a serial exhaustive scanning process, we were able to fit much of the data in the literature. In addition, we tested the model by having S give his expectancy aloud before each trial. The data showed about a 100-msec advantage for expected items that did not interact with memory load. The model fit this data reasonably well."

This assumption, however, is equally well represented in a formal model by the incorporation of a stimulus-specific learning-rate parameter, a, into the equations describing changes in the associative strength of stimuli. Theories of selective attention have also assumed (a) that subjects learn to attend to and ignore relevant and irrelevant stimuli (i.e., that a may increase or decrease depending on the correlation of a stimulus with reinforcement) and (b) that there is an inverse relationship between the probabilities of attending to different stimuli (i.e., that an increase in a to one stimulus is accompanied by a decrease in a to others). The first assumption is used to explain the phenomena of acquired distinctiveness and dimensional transfer, the second those of overshadowing and blocking. Although the first assumption is justified by the data, the second is not: Overshadowing and blocking are better explained by the choice of an appropriate rule for changing a, such that a decreases to stimuli that signal no change from the probability of reinforcement predicted by other stimuli."

Ss had to detect a letter or digit target in a field of letters or digits. When target and field were of the same category, reaction time increased with display size. When target and field category differed, reaction times were independent of display size. This category effect held even for the ambiguous target character 0 that yielded reaction time functions appropriate to how it was specified prior to presentation: as \u201czero\u201d or as \u201c\u014d.\u201d"

The present experiment sought to determine whether the effect on RT attributed to s could be accounted for by variations in P. This was accomplished by factorially varying both s and P. Probability effects were confined to items in the positive set and were insufficient to account for the effect of s. The results are discussed in terms of a model in which s and P affect different information-processing stages. The s affects the number of comparisons between the encoded item and the items stored in the memory of the positive set, as proposed by Sternberg. The P affects response selection\u2014 information as to the particular digit that was presented is available to the mechanisms for response selection along with the knowledge that there was or was not a match. The response selection mechanisms are assumed to be biased in tune with the P values of the items within the positive set. The number of things that one has to think about and the expectancy as to the likelihood of occurrence of these things\u2014 stimulus number and stimulus probability \u2014have long been regarded as fundamental variables in the study of cognition. The common rinding that longer RTs would be produced by an increase in the number of possible stimuli or a decrease in stimulus probability was a result that was compatible with most theories of stimulus recognition. Discriminating among the various theoretical accounts for these effects has been a more elusive task. One class of models holds that variations in stimulus probability and stimulus number affect only a single commodity such as information (in bits) or repetitions. Examples of such models are those that posit"

The second approach, however, enables systematic analysis of the influence of various environments and test situations on behavior of the species. The existence of interactions between variables does not imply that general statements cannot be made about genetic , age, or environmental factors per se. Significant main effects may still be the primary concern of the investigator and may frequently emerge. The value of such results increases considerably, however, if it is known that the effect occurs over a wide range of conditions and if the investigator is aware of specific interactions. How is symbolic information retrieved from recent memory? The study of short-term memory (1) has revealed some of the determinants of failures to remember, but has provided little insight into error-free performance and the retrieval processes that underlie it. One reason for the neglect of retrieval mechanisms may be the implicit assumption that a short time after several items have been memorized, they can be immediately and simultaneously available for expression in recall or in other responses, rather than having to be retrieved first. In another vocabulary (2), this is to assume the equivalence of the \"span of immediate mem-ory\" (the number of items that can be recalled without error) and the \"mo-mentary capacity of consciousness\" (the number of items immediately available). The experiments reported here (3) show that the assumption is unwarranted. Underlying the paradigm of these experiments is the supposition that if the selection of a response requires the use of information that is in memory, the latency of the response will reveal something about the process by which 652 References and Notes 1. 6. A longer, more detailed paper describing the complete study, including diallel cross and correlation analyses and a discussion of specific gamete, treatment, and sex effects is in preparation. Among previously undisturbed mice, mode of inheritance interacts with sex, and dominance appears within sexes. This finding is consist-ant with the results of J. H.

Of particular interest in the study of retrieval is the effect of the number of elements in memory on the response latency. The subject first memorizes a short series of symbols. He is then shown a test stimulus, and is required to decide whether or not it \u2026"

Reactiontime functions relating response latency to the size of the memorized set of letters were plotted, and the data are discussed in the context of the scanning models previously proposed by S. Sternberg. The reaction time functions of letter sessions and picture sessions were found to be consistent with the exhaustive model for memory scanning.

List length was determined by factorially combining two, three, or five categories with two, three, or five words per category, and test items could be one of four types: (1) positive, (2) a repeated positive, (3) a related negative, or (4) an unrelated negative. It was found that RT increased linearly with category size for both positive and related negatives (about 30-40 msec/item); whereas the increase was much smaller for the unrelated negatives, especially for three and five categories (about 9 msec/item). With an increase in the number of categories, RT increased at the rate of about 40 msec/category for all three test items. A theory of .high-speed scanning for categorized material was proposed in which a serial and exhaustive search of the categories, is first undertaken. If a positive category match is found, a serial and exhaustive search within the contents of the positive category is initiated; if no category match is found, the search is simply terminated. Some evidence was presented that categories recently probed may provide for a short-circuiting of the category search."

A second group of six subjects took part in three comparable conditions with number displays, and letters or numbers as targets. Scanning time for a number in a letter display or a letter in a number display was more rapid than scanning for a target drawn from the same set as the background. Several unpractised subjects, and all the subjects who practised the task, were able to scan as fast through letters for \u201cany number\u201d as for a specific number, or conversely through digits. The finding of different scanning rates for two precisely physically specified targets, depending on which class they were drawn from, runs counter to an explanation of high-speed scanning in terms of the operation of visual feature analysers. It is suggested that familiar categorization responses may be immediate and may provide the basis for the discrimination of relevant from irrelevant items in rapid visual scanning."

The target always appeared directly above the fixation cross. Experimentally varied were the types of noise letters (response compatible or incompatible) flanking the target and the spacing between the letters in the display. In all noise conditions, reaction time (RT) decreased as between-letter spacing increased. However, noise letters of the opposite response set were found to impair RT significantly more than same response set noise, while mixed noise letters belonging to neither set but having set-related features produced intermediate impairment. Differences between two target-alone control conditions, one presented intermixed with noise-condition trials and one presented separately in blocks, gave evidence of a preparatory set on the part of Ss to inhibit responses to the noise letters. It was concluded that S cannot prevent processing of noise letters occurring within about 1 deg of the target due to the nature of processing channel capacity and must inhibit his response until he is able to discriminate exactly which letter is in the target position. This discrimination is more difficult and time consuming at closer spacings, and inhibition is more difficult when noise letters indicate the opposite response from the targe"

The Ss needed many attempts at the same message and pieced it together only gradually, making errors and transpositions which were influenced by the probability-structure of English. They did eventually, however, succeed in separating out one of the two messages when these were normal prose, but failed when presented with strings of cliches with transitional probabilities which were high within phrases but fell to zero between them. This performance seems qualitatively different from that in the dichotic condition, and may not involve selective attention at all. The Ss might have heard both messages and retrospectively put together what made sense (in fact they did much better if allowed to write), whereas in the dichotic condition they succeeded on the first trial and could report none of the verbal content of the irrelevant message, nor even that in one case it changed to a foreign language. Broadbent put forward a general theory of selective attention which accounts for the finding with dichotic presentation by postulating a filter which selects signals arriving on one of two or more input channels and rejects others before they are fully analyzed.2 The aim of the present experiment was to investigate selective attention when it depends solely on the identification of verbal or linguistic features, using a task where the messages are presented only once and require an immediate and continuous response.

In both conditions, a signal was presented at one of three skin loci, the O stating which locus received the stimulus. In the simultaneous condition, there was a single observation interval during which a signal occurred at one of the three loci. In the sequential condition, there were three observation intervals presented successively at 800-msec intervals, with a signal presented at one of the three loci during one of the three observation intervals. Each observation interval was associated with a particular locus. Theories postulating attentional control and limitations of capacity during this type of vibrotactile information processing predict performance to be inferior in the simultaneous condition, since that condition requires sharing of attention among the three possible sources of tactile stimulation. The data showed performance to be identical in the two conditions. This result not only disconfirms the single-channel model proposed by Franzen, Markowitz, and Swets (1970), but also argues for an unlimited-capacity nonattention model of tactile perceptual processing. The results are in accord with similar findings for visual processing by Shiffrin and Gardner (1972)."

                "text": "SUMMARY Ten experiments were designed to explore the levels of processing framework for human memory research proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972). The basic notions are that the episodic memory trace may be thought of as a rather automatic by-product of operations carried out by the cognitive system and that the durability of the trace is a positive function of \"depth\" of processing, where depth refers to greater degrees of semantic involvement. Subjects were induced to process words to different depths by answering various questions about the words. For example, shallow encodings were achieved by asking questions about typescript; intermediate levels of encoding were accomplished by asking questions about rhymes; deep levels were induced by asking whether the word would fit into a given category or sentence frame. After the encoding phase was completed, subjects were unexpectedly given a recall or recognition test for the words. In general, deeper encodings took longer to accomplish and were associated with higher levels of performance on the subsequent memory test. Also, questions leading to positive responses were associated with higher retention levels than questions leading to negative responses, at least at deeper levels of encoding. Further experiments examined this pattern of effects in greater analytic detail. It was established that the original results did not simply reflect differential encoding times; an experiment was designed in which a complex but shallow task took longer to carry out but yielded lower levels of recognition than an easy, deeper task. Other studies explored reasons for the superior retention of words associated with positive responses on the initial task. Negative responses were remembered as well as positive responses when the questions led to an equally elaborate encoding in the two cases. The idea that elaboration or \"spread\" of encoding provides a better description of the results was given a further boost by the finding of the typical pattern of results under intentional learning conditions, and where each word was exposed for 6 sec in the initial phase. While spread and elaboration may indeed be better descriptive terms for the present findings, retention depends critically on the qualitative nature of the encoding operations performed; a minimal semantic analysis is more beneficial than an extensive structural analysis. Finally, Schulman's (1974) principle of congruity appears necessary for a complete description of the effects obtained. Memory performance is enhanced to the extent that the context, or encoding question, forms an integrated unit with the word presented. A congruous encoding yields superior memory performance because a more elaborate trace is laid down and because in such cases the structure of semantic memory can be utilized more effectively to facilitate retrieval. The article concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of these data and ideas for the study of human learning and memory,"

When FREQ > 1, Ss could search for only 2-3 targets at once, because they could not keep mental counters on more items. The presence of a complex background merely added a constant to search time. The main change in eye movements, with 30 days practice, was to reduce greatly the number of eye fixations, thus suggesting an increase in the useful fidld of view and/or a change in search strategy.

A number of objective tests are described, directed towards the general problem concerning the faculty we possess of perceiving only one acoustic world under normal conditions (in spite of having two ears) and yet, if our ears be stimulated by different signals, artificially, we can attend to one or the other of them. The tests have been made with continuous speech (readings from light fiction) and the results assessed statistically. The first tests aim at measuring the reaction time r required to \u201cswitch the attention\u201d from one ear to the other, as assessed by perception of the words of the message. A second set of tests show that we perceive only one speaker, as a \u201cgestalt,\u201d when the ears are stimulated by similar messages but with a delay between them exceeding 20 times that ever experienced in real life by virtue of binaural directivity."

This model is meant to apply to memory search tasks (F \u2014 1, M varies) with small memory-set sizes. It has been confirmed impressively often but is limited in scope, as it is meant to apply only to a small range of paradigms. In our present theory, serial, exhaustive search is considered to be one of the controlled search strategies, one that is very commonly adopted. The factors that lead subjects in our situation to adopt terminating, controlled search remain uncertain at present. Possibly the much larger search loads in our study led to a terminating strategy. One other minor discrepancy in results involves the Sternberg (1966) finding apparently showing fixed sets (CM) and varied sets (VM) to give equivalent set-size functions."

This model is aimed to describe visual detection in threshold tasks. It differs from many previous models in that it is quantitative and hence makes explicit, testable predictions. It makes a key assumption that the number of features abstracted, and the rate of features abstracted, from a given input stimulus will be inversely related to the total number of items simultaneously presented. That is, attention must be shared (i.e., divided) among multiple inputs, even at the earliest stages of processing. The simultaneous-successive studies by Shiffrin and Gardner (1972), described earlier, most clearly show that this assumption is false."

Gordon (1968) showed that a set of four distractors in a CM search task was recognized near the chance level even after 10 days of practice."
