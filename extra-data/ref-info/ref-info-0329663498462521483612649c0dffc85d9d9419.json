Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states.

Theoretical and practical disadvantages of the training techniques reported in current literature on CRFs are discussed. We hypothesise that general numerical optimisation techniques result in improved performance over iterative scaling algorithms for training CRFs. Experiments run on a a subset of a well-known text chunking data set [28] confirm that this is indeed the case. This is a highly promising result, indicating that such parameter estimation techniques make CRFs a practical and efficient choice for labelling sequential data, as well as a theoretically sound and principled probabilistic framework."

For example, in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. A standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations between them. Recently, Probabilistic Relational Models, a relational version of Bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection of related entities. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds on (conditional) Markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach. First, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation of many important relational dependencies in directed models. Second, undirected models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification accuracy. We show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of multiple related entities. We provide experimental results on a webpage classification task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies."

As in generative models, the training data does not have to specify the edit sequences between the given string pairs.

Applications range from finding the author and title in research papers to finding the phone number and street address in a web page. The CMM framework combines a priori knowledge encoded as features with a set of labeled training data to learn an efficient extraction process. We will show that similar problems can be solved more effectively by learning a discriminative context free grammar from training data. The grammar has several distinct advantages: long range, even global, constraints can be used to disambiguate entity labels; training data is used more efficiently; and a set of new more powerful features can be introduced. The grammar based approach also results in semantic information (encoded in the form of a parse tree) which could be used for IR applications like question answering. The specific problem we consider is of extracting personal contact, or address, information from unstructured sources such as documents and emails. While linear-chain CMMs perform reasonably well on this task, we show that a statistical parsing approach results in a 50% reduction in error rate. This system also has the advantage of being interactive, similar to the system described in [9]. In cases where there are multiple errors, a single user correction can be propagated to correct multiple errors automatically. Using a discriminatively trained grammar, 93.71% of all tokens are labeled correctly (compared to 88.43% for a CMM) and 72.87% of records have all tokens labeled correctly (compared to 45.29% for the CMM)."

Therefore, we want to transfer learning from the old, general-purpose subtask to a more specific new task, for which there is often less data. While work in transfer learning often considers how the old task should affect learning on the new task, in this paper we show that it helps to take into account how the new task affects the old. Specifically, we perform joint decoding of separately-trained sequence models, preserving uncertainty between the tasks and allowing information from the new task to affect predictions on the old task. On two standard text data sets, we show that joint decoding outperforms cascaded decoding."

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

(1998).1 As in DBNs, this factorized structure can use many fewer parameters than the cross-product state space: even the two-level FCRF we discuss below uses less than an eighth of the parameters of the corresponding cross-product CRF.\n1Hierarchical HMMs were shown to be DBNs by Murphy and Paskin (2001)."

Our formulation uses a factorization analogous to the standard dynamic programs for parsing. In particular, it allows one to efficiently learn a model which discriminates among the entire space of parse trees, as opposed to reranking the top few candidates. Our models can condition on arbitrary features of input sentences, thus incorporating an important kind of lexical information without the added algorithmic complexity of modeling headedness. We provide an efficient algorithm for learning such models and show experimental evidence of the model\u2019s improved performance over a natural baseline model and a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar."

Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extending the standard Baum-Welch (forward-backward) algorithm, we derive an efficient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the first application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can be used to automatically identify repeated strokes that represent combination of letters in cursive handwriting."

The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classification problems using the graph min-cut algorithms. The performance of the model was verified on the synthetic as well as the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments."

Unfortunately, the original inference algorithm is rather complicated, and takes O(T3) time, where is the length of the sequence, making it impractical for many domains. In this paper, we show how HHMMs are a special kind of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), and thereby derive a much simpler inference algorithm, which only takes O(T) time. Furthermore, by drawing the connection between HHMMs and DBNs, we enable the application of many standard approximation techniques to further speed up inference."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes."

                "text": "Dynamic Bayesian Networks: Representation, Inference and Learning by Kevin Patrick Murphy Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science University of California, Berkeley Professor Stuart Russell, Chair Modelling sequential data is important in many areas of science and engineering. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Kalman filter models (KFMs) are popular for this because they are simple and flexible. For example, HMMs have been used for speech recognition and bio-sequence analysis, and KFMs have been used for problems ranging from tracking planes and missiles to predicting the economy. However, HMMs and KFMs are limited in their \u201cexpressive power\u201d. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) generalize HMMs by allowing the state space to be represented in factored form, instead of as a single discrete random variable. DBNs generalize KFMs by allowing arbitrary probability distributions, not just (unimodal) linear-Gaussian. In this thesis, I will discuss how to represent many different kinds of models as DBNs, how to perform exact and approximate inference in DBNs, and how to learn DBN models from sequential data. In particular, the main novel technical contributions of this thesis are as follows: a way of representing Hierarchical HMMs as DBNs, which enables inference to be done in O(T ) time instead of O(T ), where T is the length of the sequence; an exact smoothing algorithm that takes O(log T ) space instead of O(T ); a simple way of using the junction tree algorithm for online inference in DBNs; new complexity bounds on exact online inference in DBNs; a new deterministic approximate inference algorithm called factored frontier; an analysis of the relationship between the BK algorithm and loopy belief propagation; a way of applying Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering to DBNs in general, and the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem in particular; a way of extending the structural EM algorithm to DBNs; and a variety of different applications of DBNs. However, perhaps the main value of the thesis is its catholic presentation of the field of sequential data modelling."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

This paper describes the application of HMMs to another language related task--information extraction--the problem of locating textual sub-segments that answer a particular information need. In our work, the HMM state transition probabilities and word emission probabilities are learned from labeled training data. As in many machine learning problems, however, the lack of sufficient labeled training data hinders the reliability of the model. The key contribution of this paper is the use of a statistical technique called \"shrinkage\" that significantly improves parameter estimation of the HMM emission probabilities in the face of sparse training data. In experiments on seminar announcements and Reuters acquisitions articles, shrinkage is shown to reduce error by up to 40%, and the resulting HMM outperforms a state-of-the-art rule-learning system."

In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable\u2014the hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward\u2013backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot."

This paper employs Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting various common fields from the headers and citation of research papers. The basic theory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but best-practices for applying them to real-world data requires additional exploration. This paper makes an empirical exploration of several factors, including variations on Gaussian, exponential and hyperbolic-L1 priors for improved regularization, and several classes of features and Markov order. On a standard benchmark data set, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%, and word error rate by 78% in comparison with the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares even more favorably against HMMs."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

We show that WFSTs provide a common and natural representation for hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency, pronunciation dictionaries, grammars, and alternative recognition outputs. Furthermore, general transducer operations combine these representations flexibly and efficiently. Weighted determinization and minimization algorithms optimize their time and space requirements, and a weight pushing algorithm distributes the weights along the paths of a weighted transducer optimally for speech recognition. As an example, we describe a North American Business News (NAB) recognition system built using these techniques that combines the HMMs, full cross-word triphones, a lexicon of 40 000 words, and a large trigram grammar into a single weighted transducer that is only somewhat larger than the trigram word grammar and that runs NAB in real-time on a very simple decoder. In another example, we show that the same techniques can be used to optimize lattices for second-pass recognition. In a third example, we show how general automata operations can be used to assemble lattices from different recognizers to improve recognition performance."

In place of syntactic and semantic information, other sources of information can be used, such as term frequency, typography, formatting, and mark-up. We describe four learning approaches to this problem, each drawn from a different paradigm: a rote learner, a term-space learner based on Naive Bayes, an approach using grammatical induction, and a relational rule learner. Experiments on 14 information extraction problems defined over four diverse document collections demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Finally, we describe a multistrategy approach which combines these learners and yields performance competitive with or better than the best of them. This technique is modular and flexible, and could find application in other machine learning problems."

                "text": "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

We term this problem on-line plan recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. In terms of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then describe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this model. In terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution, leading to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited, can lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms. We demonstrate the usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in a complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance data."

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201cbaseNP\u201d chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices."

(1998).1 As in DBNs, this factorized structure can use many fewer parameters than the cross-product state space: even the two-level FCRF we discuss below uses less than an eighth of the parameters of the corresponding cross-product CRF.\n1Hierarchical HMMs were shown to be DBNs by Murphy and Paskin (2001)."

Information extraction populates slots in a database by identifying relevant subsequences of text, but is usually not aware of the emerging patterns and regularities in the database. Data mining methods begin from a populated database, and are often unaware of where the data came from, or its inherent uncertainties. The result is that the accuracy of both suffers, and significant mining of complex text sources is beyond reach. This position paper proposes the use of unified, relational, undirected graphical models for information extraction and data mining, in which extraction decisions and data-mining decisions are made in the same probabilistic \u201ccurrency,\u201d with a common inference procedure\u2014each component thus being able to make up for the weaknesses of the other and therefore improving the performance of both. For example, data mining run on a partiallyfilled database can find patterns that provide \u201ctopdown\u201d accuracy-improving constraints to information extraction. Information extraction can provide a much richer set of \u201cbottom-up\u201d hypotheses to data mining if the mining is set up to handle additional uncertainty information from extraction. We outline an approach and describe several models, but provide no experimental results."

In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

Lacking perfect knowledge, an agent may be constrained to believe that a proposition persists indefinitely simply because there is no way for the agent to infer a contravening proposition with certainty. In this paper, we describe a model of causal reasoning that accounts for knowledge concerning cause\u2010and\u2010effect relationships and knowledge concerning the tendency for propositions to persist or not as a function of time passing. Our model has a natural encoding in the form of a network representation for probabilistic models. We consider the computational properties of our model by reviewing recent advances in computing the consequences of models encoded in this network representation. Finally, we discuss how our probabilistic model addresses certain classical problems in temporal reasoning (e. g., the frame and qualification problems)."

(1998).1 As in DBNs, this factorized structure can use many fewer parameters than the cross-product state space: even the two-level FCRF we discuss below uses less than an eighth of the parameters of the corresponding cross-product CRF.\n1Hierarchical HMMs were shown to be DBNs by Murphy and Paskin (2001)."

The use of visual features is justified by both the bimodality of the speech generation and by the need of features that are invariant to acoustic noise perturbation. The audio-visual speech recognition system presented in this paper introduces a novel audio-visual fusion technique that uses a coupled hidden Markov model (HMM). The statistical properties of the coupled-HMM allow us to model the state asynchrony of the audio and visual observations sequences while still preserving their natural correlation over time. The experimental results show that the coupled HMM outperforms the multistream HMM in audio visual speech recognition."

(1998).1 As in DBNs, this factorized structure can use many fewer parameters than the cross-product state space: even the two-level FCRF we discuss below uses less than an eighth of the parameters of the corresponding cross-product CRF.\n1Hierarchical HMMs were shown to be DBNs by Murphy and Paskin (2001)."

It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side."

For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side."

It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side."
