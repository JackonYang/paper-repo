                "text": "We have developed a new stereo algorithm that goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using an image description that is richer than attributes of edges or pixel-brightness values. The algorithm also incorporates several stereo cues that have previously been neglected in the computer vision literature. \nAny stereo algorithm must have at its core a basic and robust mechanism for establishing correspondence between two images. We use linear spatial filters at a range of scales and orientations that are similar to those known to exist in the visual cortex. Filter responses at a given point characterize the local image patch, providing a more concise representation than traditional correlation-based techniques. A simple similarity measure, motivated by robust statistics, serves as a basis for establishing correspondence between image patches in two views. From initial horizontal and vertical disparity estimates, additional information can be recovered about a scene. The viewing geometry, along with the locations of depth discontinuities and occluded regions, all can be recovered and used to iteratively refine the disparity estimates. \nOrientation and spatial frequency disparities can be related geometrically to the slant and tilt of surfaces in a scene. These cues have traditionally been regarded as noise when determining point correspondences. We have developed two new algorithms for recovering local surface orientation based on orientation and spatial frequency disparities: (1) a least squares algorithm based on measurements of corresponding line segments, and (2) a method that makes use of filter responses directly. The second method has also been shown to account for some previously unexplained psychophysical observations by Tyler and Sutter, and von der Heydt. \nIn primary visual cortex of both macaque monkey and cat, inputs from the two eyes are segregated into alternating zones known as ocular dominance bands. If the striking differences in the overall arrangements of these inputs reflect important differences in the basic rules governing cortical ocular dominance, then this poses a problem for attempts to formulate general principles of visual cortical organization. We have formulated and tested a single computational model that accurately predicts the quite dissimilar ocular dominance pattern in cat and monkey. This model also generalizes to predict the ocular dominance pattern in three-eyed frogs, supporting the notion that the overall pattern of ocular dominance is governed by a common set of rules."

We examine geometric constraints on stereo correspondence and describe progress toward formulation from first principles of an evaluation function for selection of the best among alternative correspondences. Within a surface interpretation, conditions on correspondence of edges and surface intervals are shown. These conditions are useful with wide angle stereo and provide particularly tight constraints for narrow angle stereo. We invoke the general assumption that edge and surface orientations are not related to observer position. We are combining these general constraints with ongoing work in scene modeling of known regularities which include distributions with respect to the gravity vector (horizontal and vertical edges and surfaces), parallelism and alignment with local coordinate systems, and orthogonal corners. We will use them to calculate a likelihood measure for correspondences."

Integration is necessary to ensure that the detected surfaces are smooth. Surface interpolation takes into account detected occluding and ridge contours in the scene; interpolation is performed within regions enclosed by these contours. Planar and quadratic patches are used as local models of the surface. Occluded regions in the image are identified, and are not used for matching and interpolation. A coarse-to-fine algorithm is presented that generates a multiresolution hierarchy of surface maps, one at each level of resolution. Experimental results are given for a variety of stereo images. >"

Partial derivatives of images smoothed with a few different-sized Gaussian filters are suggested as suitable measurements. A specific computation is shown based on a stochastic image model to reliably establish whether or not two points correspond, provided that the signal to correspondence noise ratio in the images to be matched exceeds two. The computation has been applied to artificial and natural images with encouraging results. (Author)"

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."

The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered with bar masks of four sizes that vary with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are about one octave wide. (2) Zero-crossings of the mask values are localized, and positions that correspond to terminations are found; (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between pairs of zero- crossings or terminations of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence; (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is written into a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2 D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing phychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance, about the wsize of Panum?s area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the fusion process."

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

With the increasing demand for 3-D spatial information for tasks of passive navigation [7,12], automatic surveillance [9], aerial cartography [10,13], and inspection in industrial automation, the importance of effective stereo analysis has been made quite clear. A particular challenge is to provide reliable and accurate depth data for input to object or terrain modelling systems (such as [5]. This paper describes an algorithm for such stereo sensing It uses an edge-based line-by-line stereo correlation scheme, and appears to be fast, robust, and parallel implementable. The processing consists of extracting edge descriptions for a stereo pair of images, linking these edges to their nearest neighbors to obtain the edge connectivity structure, correlating the edge descriptions on the basis of local edge properties, then cooperatively removmg those edge correspondences determined to be in error - those which violate the connectivity structure of the two images. A further correlation process, using a technique similar to that used for the edges, is applied to the image intensity values over intervals defined by the previous correlation The result of the processing is a full image array disparity map of the scene viewed."

Method 2 does not need this assumption. The vertical disparities are first used to obtain the values of the gaze and viewing distance.

Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

In machine vision algorithms, orientation and spatial frequency disparities are a source of error in finding stereo correspondence because one seeks to find features or areas which are similar in the two views when, in fact, they are systematically different. In other words, it is common to treat as noise what is useful signal."

It is potentially important in suggesting a role for vertical disparity in stereoscopic vision, as proposed by Helmholtz. The paper first discusses previous theories of the induced effect and their implications. A theory is then developed attributing the effect to the process by which the stereoscopic response to horizontal disparity is scaled for viewing distance and eccentricity. The theory is based on a mathematical analysis of vertical disparity gradients produced by surfaces at various distances and eccentricities relative to the observer. Vertical disparity is shown to be an approximately linear function of eccentricity, with a slope or gradient which decreases with observation distance. The effect of vertical magnification on such gradients is analyzed and shown to be consistent with a change in the eccentricity factor, but not the distance factor, required to scale horizontal disparity. The induced effect is shown to be an appropriate stereoscopic response to a zero horizontal disparity surface at the eccentricity indicated. However, since extraretinal convergence signals provide conflicting evidence about eccentricity, they may attenuate the induced effect from its mathematically predicted value. The discomfort associated with the induced effect is attributed to this conflict."

Steerable filters may be designed in quadrature pairs to allow adaptive control over phase as well as orientation. The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"
