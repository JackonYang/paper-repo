This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Therefore, how to use frequent classes to help learning rare classes for which it is harder to collect the training data is an open question. Learning with Shared Information is an emerging topic in machine learning, computer vision and multimedia analysis. There are different level of components that can be shared during concept modeling and machine learning stages, such as sharing generic object parts, sharing attributes, sharing transformations, sharing regularization parameters and sharing training examples, etc. Regarding the specific methods, multi-task learning, transfer learning and deep learning can be seen as using different strategies to share information. These learning with shared information methods are very effective in solving real-world large-scale problems. This special issue aims at gathering the recent advances in learning with shared information methods and their applications in computer vision and multimedia analysis. Both state-of-the-art works, as well as literature reviews, are welcome for submission. Papers addressing interesting real-world computer vision and multimedia applications are especially encouraged.

                "text": "Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations. Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of 15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model."

For each viewpoint, we construct a decision rule that determines if the object is present at that specific orientation. Each decision rule uses the statistics of both object appearance and \u201cnon-object\u201d visual appearance. We represent each set of statistics using a product of histograms. Each histogram represents the joint statistics of a subset of wavelet coefficients and their position on the object. Our approach is to use many such histograms representing a wide variety of visual attributes. Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect faces that vary from frontal view to full profile view and the first algorithm that can reliably detect cars over a wide range of viewpoints."

This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

First, we developed a representation of face images based on independent component analysis (ICA) and compared it to a principal component analysis (PCA) representation for face recognition. The ICA basis vectors for this data set were more spatially local than the PCA basis vectors and the ICA representation had greater invariance to changes in pose. Second, we present a model for the development of viewpoint invariant responses to faces from visual experience in a biological system. The temporal continuity of natural visual experience was incorporated into an attractor network model by Hebbian learning following a lowpass temporal filter on unit activities. When combined with the temporal filter, a basic Hebbian update rule became a generalization of Griniasty et al. (1993), which associates temporally proximal input patterns into basins of attraction. The system acquired representations of faces that were largely independent of pose."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
