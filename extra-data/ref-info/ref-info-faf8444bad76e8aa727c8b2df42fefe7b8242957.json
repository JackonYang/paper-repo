The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques."

By incorporating this saliency measure into the shape matching process, we able to discriminate between shape forms as well as take boundary texture into consideration when computing shape similarity. This paper also describes a multi-resolution pyramidal framework for generating the required gradient vector field and vector field disparity map from which the shape descriptors, in the form of gradient vector field histograms, are derived. Experimental results involving silhouettes images are presented to demonstrate the various characteristics of the proposed shape descriptor, which includes its invariance to similarity transform and its ability to match composite shapes containing boundary noise and texture, limb articulation and occlusion."

In the light of our experiments, we suggest improvements to the shape context: shape contexts are used to find corresponding features between model and image. In real images it is shown that the shape context is highly influenced by clutters; furthermore, even when the object is correctly localized, the feature correspondence may be poor. We show that the robustness of shape matching can be increased by including a figural continuity constraint. The combined shape and continuity cost is minimized using the Viterbi algorithm on features, resulting in improved localization and correspondence. Our algorithm can be generally applied to any feature based shape matching method. Chamfer matching correlates model templates with the distance transform of the edge image. This can be done efficiently using a coarse-to-fine search over the transformation parameters. The method is robust in clutter, however, multiple templates are needed to handle scale, rotation and shape variation. We compare both methods for locating hand shapes in cluttered images, and applied to word recognition in EZ-Gimpy images."

Our object representation comprises descriptive images associated with each oriented point on the surface of an object. Using a single point basis constructed from an oriented point, the position of other points on the surface of the object can be described by two parameters. The accumulation of these parameters for many points on the surface of the object results in an image at each oriented point. These images, localized descriptions of the global shape of the object, are invariant to rigid transformations. Through correlation of images, point correspondences between a model and scene data are established and then grouped using geometric consistency. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated with results showing recognition of complex objects in cluttered scenes with occlusion."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

The maxima of curvature zero crossing contours of Curvature Scale Space (CSS) image are used to represent the shapes of object boundary contours. While a complex boundary is represented by about ve pairs of integer values, an eeective indexing method based on the aspect ratio of the CSS image , eccentricity and circularity is used to narrow down the range of searching. Since the matching algorithm has been designed to use global information, it is sensitive to major occlusion, but some minor occlusion will not cause any problems. We have tested and evaluated our method on a prototype database of 450 images of marine animals with a vast variety of shapes with very good results. The method can either be used in real applications or produce a reliable shape description for more complicated images when other features such as color and texture should also be considered. Since shape similarity is a subjective issue, in order to evaluate the method, we asked a number of volunteers to perform similarity retrieval based on shape on a randomly selected small database. We then compared the results of this experiment to the outputs of our system to the same queries and on the same database. The comparison indicated a promising performance of the system."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

This implies that the parameters for each system were optimally determined and the implementations were thoroughly rested. (2) It was possible to compare the performance of shape descriptors based on totally different mathematical approaches. A more theoretical comparison of these descriptors seems to be extremely hard.

The key problem in creating a specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes. The algorithm -which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models-is shown to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible model of handwritten digits."

As a measure of shape equivalence we will use the concept of order structure which in principle can be defined for arbitrary geometric configurations such as points lines and curves. The order structure equivalence of subsets of points and tangent directions of a shape is will be used to establish pointwise correspondence.

People are highly non-rigid objects with a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or on motion. The detection technique is based on the novel idea of the wavelet template that defines the shape of an object in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is invariant to changes in color and texture and can be used to robustly define a rich and complex class of objects such as people. We show how the invariant properties and computational efficiency of the wavelet template make it an effective tool for object detection."

This paper proposes an intermediate approach based on a characterization of the symmetry in edge maps. The use of symmetry matching as a joint correlation measure between pairs of edge elements further constrains the comparison of edge maps. In addition, a natural organization of groups of symmetry into a hierarchy leads to a graph-based representation of relational structure of components of shape that allows for deformations by changing attributes of this relational graph. A graduate assignment graph matching algorithm is used to match symmetry structure in images to stored prototypes or sketches. The results of matching sketches and grey-scale images against a small database consisting of a variety of fish, planes, tools, etc., are depicted."

                "text": "The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning and recognition methodology."

The method is based on the idea of describing objects in terms of generalized symmetries, as defined by each object's eigenmodes. The resulting modal description is used for object recognition and categorization, where shape similarities are expressed as the amounts of modal deformation energy needed to align the two objects. In general, modes provide a global-to-local ordering of shape deformation and thus allow for selecting which types of deformations are used in object alignment and comparison. In contrast to previous techniques, which required correspondence to be computed with an initial or prototype shape, modal matching utilizes a new type of finite element formulation that allows for an object's eigenmodes to be computed directly from available image information. This improved formulation provides greater generality and accuracy, and is applicable to data of any dimensionality. Correspondence results with 2D contour and point feature data are shown, and recognition experiments with 2D images of hand tools and airplanes are described. >"

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

Retrieving images by their content, as opposed to external features, has become an important operation. A fundamental ingredient for content-based image retrieval is the technique used for comparing images. There are two general methods for image comparison: intensity based (color and texture) and geometry based (shape). A recent user survey about cognition aspects of image retrieval shows that users are more interested in retrieval by shape than by color and texture [62]. However, retrieval by shape is still considered one of the most difficult aspects of content-based search. Indeed, systems such as IBM\u2019s Query By Image Content, QBIC [57], perhaps one of the most advanced image retrieval systems to date, is relatively successful in retrieving by color and texture, but performs poorly when searching on shape. A similar behavior is exhibited in the new Alta Vista photo finder [10]."

Our flexible algorithm is designed to match curves under substantial deformations and arbitrary large scaling and rigid transformations. A syntactic representation is constructed for both curves and an edit transformation which maps one curve to the other is found using dynamic programming. We present extensive experiments where we apply the algorithm to silhouette matching. In these experiments, we examine partial occlusion, viewpoint variation, articulation, and class matching (where silhouettes of similar objects are matched). Based on the qualitative syntactic matching, we define a dissimilarity measure and we compute it for every pair of images in a database of 121 images. We use this experiment to objectively evaluate our algorithm. First, we compare our results to those reported by others. Second, we use the dissimilarity values in order to organize the image database into shape categories. The veridical hierarchical organization stands as evidence to the quality of our matching and similarity estimation."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

The algorithm utilizes the soft assign for the correspondence and the thin-plate spline for the non-rigid mapping. Embedded within a deterministic annealing framework, the algorithm can automatically reject a fraction of the points as outliers. Experiments on both 2D synthetic point-sets with varying degrees of deformation, noise and outliers, and on real 3D sulcal point-sets (extracted from brain MRI) demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The algorithm maximizes the inner product of two matrices, one of which is the desired \u2018pairing matrix \u2019 and the other a \u2018proximity matrix \u2019 with elements exp (\u2013 r2ij/2\u03c32), where rij is the distance between two features, one in each image, and \u03c3 is an adjustable scale parameter. The output of the algorithm may be compared with the movements that people perceive when viewing two images in quick succession, and it is found that an increase in \u03c3 affects the computed correspondences in much the same way as an increase in interstimulus interval alters the perceived displacements. Provided that \u03c3 is not too small the algorithm will recover the feature mappings that result from image translation, expansion or shear deformation \u2013 transformations of common occurrence in image sequences \u2013 even when the displacements of individual features depart slightly from the general trend."

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

This function can be derived explicitly for the case of visual perception of rigid bodies by ambulant observers. The function depends on physical causation, not physiology; consequently, one can make a priori statements about possible internal models. A posteriori it seems likely that the orientation sensitive units described by Hubel and Wiesel constitute a physiological substrate subserving the extraction of the invariants of this function. The function is used to define a measure for the visual complexity of solid shape. Relations with Gestalt theories of perception are discussed."

When m = 1, we find that Y\\ = S k ~ 2 ; when m ^ 3, the shape-space contains singularities. This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space I* ca n be identified with a version of CP*~ 2 . Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CP k ~ 2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the \"virtual support vector\" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the \"reduced set\" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1 % error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances. The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine."

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."

The proper abstract setting is a Hilbert function space whose reproducing kernel involves no functions more complicated than logarithms and is easily coded. Convenient representation formulas are given, as also a practical multivariate extension of the Peano kernel theorem. Owing to the numerical stability of Cholesky factorization of positive definite symmetric matrices, the whole construction process of a surface spline can be described as a recursive algorithm, the data relative to the various interpolation points being exploited in sequence.R\u00e9sum\u00e9La m\u00e9thode concr\u00e8te d'interpolation par surfaces-spline est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me classique de la minimisation d'une semi-norme de Soboleff sous des contraintes d'interpolation; la structure intrins\u00e8que des surfaces-spline est d\u00e8s lors celle d'une extension multivari\u00e9e des fonctions-spline naturelles.

In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term generalized regularization networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call generalized regularization networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are (1) radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions, and several perceptron-like neural networks with one hidden layer."

Using the eigendecompositions of the adjacency matrices (in the case of the undirected-graph-matching problem) or Hermitian matrices derived from the adjacency matrices (in the case of the directed-graph-matching problem), a matching close to the optimum can be found efficiently when the graphs are sufficiently close to each other.

A Pascal implementation is presented.ZusammenfassungWir entwickeln einen Algorithmus mit k\u00fcrzesten alternierenden Wegen f\u00fcr das lineare Zuordnungsproblem.

On the interaction of selective attention and lexical knowledge: A connectionist account of neglect dyslexia. D 1998 The effects of focal anterior and posterior brain lesions on verbal fluency. The discipline has emerged in the 1990s at the interface between the neural sciences and the cognitive and computational sciences. On one side, it grows out of the traditions of cognitive psychology and neuro-psychology, which use behavioral experiments to uncover the processes and mechanisms lying behind human cognitive functions, and of computational approaches within cognitive psychology, which rely on computational models to develop explicit mech-anistic accounts of these functions. On the other side, it grows out of the traditions of behavioral, functional, and systems neuroscience, which use neurophysio-logical and neuroanatomical methods to explore the mechanisms underlying complex functions. It draws on findings and principles of cellular and molecular neuroscience. It joins these approaches with the use of new functional brain imaging methods, such as functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), as well as other methods including electroencephalography (EEG) and mag-netoencephalography (MEG), and with a growing research tradition in computational neuroscience. A starting point for cognitive neuroscience is the idea that a cognitive or mental state consists of a pattern of activity distributed over many neurons. For example, the experience an individual has when holding, sniffing , and viewing a rose is a complex pattern of neural activity, distributed over many brain regions, including the participation of neurons in visual, somato-sensory, and olfactory, and possibly extending to language areas participating in representing the sound of the word 'rose' and\\or other areas where activity represents the content of an associated memory that may be evoked by the experience. These patterns of activation arise from excitatory and inhibitory interactions among the participating neurons, mediated by connections called synapses. The inputs neurons receive cause them to 'fire' or emit impulses called spikes or action potentials, which travel down their axons to synaptic terminals where they cause the release of chemicals that then have excitatory or inhibitory influences on the neurons on the other side of the synapse. The combined effect of the incoming signals to each neuron, together with its recent history, determines whether it will fire at a particular moment. Figure 1 indicates something of the fundamental circuitry involved, though it should be noted that only one out of \u2026"

Gelijkenismaten zijn \neen solide basis voor zulke technieken. \nDit proefschrift behandelt de wiskundige en algoritmische aspecten van geli- \njkenismaten. Het eerste aspect heeft te maken met de vraag hoe de gelijkenis \ntussen geometrische patronen zou moeten worden gemeten. Het tweede aspect \nheeft te maken met de berekening van een gelijkenismaat en de minimalisatie \nvan de waarde van een gelijkenismaat onder geometrische transformaties. \nIn Hoofdstuk 2 presenteer ik een nieuwe theorie die gebruikt wordt voor \nde analyse van verschillende gelijkenismaten. De aandacht ligt bij gelijkenis- \nmaten die pseudometrieken zijn op een collectie van deelverzamelingen van een \nruimte. Zoals de \\grote-oh\" notatie kan worden gebruikt om uitspraken te \ndoen over de ecientie van algoritmen, zo kan de nieuwe theorie in dit proef- \nschrift worden gebruikt om zinvolle uitspraken te doen over de robuustheid \nvan gelijkenismaten. The theorie voor gelijkenismaten wordt toegepast in de \nanalyse van zowel bekende gelijkenismaten als nieuwe gelijkenismaten die wor- \nden geintroduceerd in dit proefschrift. De bestaande gelijkenismaten zijn o.a. \nde Hausdor metriek en het volume van het symmetrische verschil. De nieuwe \ngelijkenismaten zijn o.a. het genormaliseerde volume van het symmetrische ver- \nschil en de re ectie-zichtbaarheids afstand. \nEerst bespreek ik de theorie van algemene pseudometrische ruimten. Deze \nverhandeling gaat onder meer over de transformatiegroep waaronder een pseu- \ndometrische ruimte invariant is, de topologie behorende bij een pseudometrische \nruimte en de operaties die kunnen worden toegepast op een pseudometrische \nruimte. Ook laat ik zien hoe de minimalisatie van een pseudometriek onder een \ntransformatiegroep tot een nieuwe pseudometriek leidt die onafhankelijk is van \ntransformaties. Verder laat ik zien hoe een pseudometrische ruimte kan worden \nuitgebreid met een nieuw element zonder dat de essenti?ele eigenschappen van \n171?de oorspronkelijke ruimte verloren gaan. Deze techniek kan worden toegepast \nom het domein van een gelijkenismaat uit te breiden met de lege verzameling. \nVervolgens introduceer ik een nieuwe structuur: de pseudometrische pa- \ntroonruimte. Deze structuur is rijker dan pseudometrische ruimten in het al- \ngemeen. In het bijzonder maken pseudometrische ruimten de formalisatie van \nverschillende soorten robuustheid mogelijk. In de vakliteratuur wordt het be- \nlang van robuustheidseigenschappen voor een gelijkenismaat bevestigd. Echter, \nzover ik weet, zijn dit soort eigenschappen tot nu toe nooit precies gemaakt. In \nde vorm van vier axioma's druk ik vier soorten robuustheid uit. Deze vormen \nvan robuustheid heten vervormings robuustheid, vervagings robuustheid, barst \nrobuustheid en ruis robuustheid. Ik bewijs dat de axioma's zich netjes gedragen \nonder de toepassing van verschillende standaard operaties op pseudometrische \npatroonruimten. \nHierna geef ik een nieuwe methode waarmee verschillende pseudometrieken \nop een collectie patronen kunnen worden geconstrueerd. De constructie meth- \node is gebaseerd op de toekenningvan re?elwaardige functies aan patronen. \nIk bewijs dat eenvoudige voorwaarden op deze toekenning voldoende zijn om \nde invariantie onder een gegeven transformatiegroep te garanderen. De con- \nstructie methode wordt op verschillende plaatsen in dit proefschrift toegepast, \nresulterend in nieuwe gelijkenismaten. \nDe nieuw ontwikkelde theorie wordt eerst toegepast om de Hausdor me- \ntriek te analyseren. Dit resulteert in een aantal nieuwe resultaten voor de \nHausdor metriek. Ik breid een bestaan resultaat van Matheron [94] uit door te \nlaten zien dat de met de lege verzameling uitgebreide Hausdor metriek precies \nde \\bijziende\" topologie denieert op de collectie van alle compacte deelverza- \nmelingen van een metrische \\basisruimte\". Deze topologie wordt vervolgens \ngebruikt om eenvoudig te bewijzen dat de Hausdor metriek vervormings, ver- \nvagings, en barst robuust is. Verder toon ik aan dat in een groot aantal gevallen \nde Hausdor metriek niet ruis robuust is. \nVervolgens analyseer ik een andere gelijkenismaat, het volume van het sym- \nmetrische verschil. In de analyse komen de volgende nieuwe resultaten voort. Ik \nbewijs dat het volume van het symmetrische verschil een topologie voortbrengt \ndie onvergelijkbaar is met die van de Hausdor metriek. Ook introduceer ik \neen nieuwe gelijkenismaat die het genormaliseerde volume van het symmetrische \nverschil wordt genoemd. Ik laat zien dat deze afstandmaat invariant is onder \nratio-van-volume behoudende transformaties. Verder bewijs ik dat het volume \nvan het symmetrische verschil en de genormaliseerde versie daarvan aan elk \nvan de vier robuustheidsaxioma's voldoen. \nVerder introduceer ik een nieuwe gelijkenismaat: de re ectie-zichtbaarheids \nafstand. De denitie hiervan is gebaseerd op de bovengenoemde construc- \ntiemethode. De re ectie-zichtbaarheids afstand is een metriek op een vrij al- \n172?gemene klasse van (k"
