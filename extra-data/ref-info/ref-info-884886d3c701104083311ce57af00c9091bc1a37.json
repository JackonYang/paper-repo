In particular, the Gestaltists proposed the law of shared common fate1,2, in which features tend to be perceived as moving together, that is, coherently. Recent psychophysical findings, such as the cooperativity of the motion system3,4 and motion capture5,6, support this law. Computationally, coherence is a sensible assumption, because if two features are close then they probably belong to the same object and thus tend to move together. Moreover, the measurement of local motion may be inaccurate7 and so the integration of motion information over large areas may help to improve the performance. Present theories of visual motion, however, do not account fully for these coherent motion percepts. We propose here a theory that does account for these phenomena and also provides a solution to the aperture problem8, where the local information in the image flow is insufficient to specify the motion uniquely."

Ullman: The Interpretation of Visual Motion, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1979) that is implemented by a massively parallel network. In this network, every two units are interconnected, and thus, its convergence is fast and relatively independent of the number of image features. Computer simulations show that our method accounts as well as the Minimal Mapping Theory for apparent-motion phenomena, although some differences exist. Mathematical proofs provide conditions for the convergence of the network. The second 'solution' for the correspondence problem is called the Structural Theory. This theory assumes that the three-dimensional structure of viewed objects does not change fast in time. Then, the theory looks for the correspondence and three-dimensional structure that best fulfill this assumption. A massively parallel network implementation of this theory is also possible. However, its performance is poor due to the high complexity of its solution space. This supports Ullman's (1979) suggestion that the visual system separates the structure-from-motion process into two stages. First, a stage for motion measurement, and then a stage for structure recovery."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

The model is applied to threshold experiments in which subjects view adjacent vertical bars with independently (typically sinusoidally), temporally modulated luminances. The subject must report whether the patterns moved to the left or to the right. According to the model, a basic motion-detecting unit consists of two subunits tuned to opposite directions. Each performs a spatial and temporal linear filtering of its input; outputs of the filters are multiplied, and the multiplied output is integrated (for a time that is long relative to the modulation period). The model's output consists of the difference between the subunit outputs. Direction of movement is indicated by the sign of the model output. Mathematical analysis of the model yielded several predictions that were confirmed experimentally. Specifically, we found that (1) performance with complex patterns can be predicted by spatiotemporal Fourier analysis that results in the segregation and linear addition in the output for different temporal frequencies; (2) under special conditions, performance depends on the product of adjacent bar amplitudes, offering strong support for the multiplication principle; (3) performance is unaffected by addition of stationary patterns; and (4) addition of homogeneous flicker normally produces no effect but under special conditions reverses perceived direction. These and other results confirm our model and reject several other models, including Reichardt 's original model."

Because there is a family of physical motions of various directions and speeds that appear identical, the motion of the grating is ambiguous. In contrast, when two crossed moving gratings are superimposed, the resulting plaid pattern usually moves unambiguously and predictably. In certain cases, however, two gratings do not combine into a single coherent percept, but appear to slide across one another. We have studied the conditions under which coherence does and does not occur, and we report here that it depends on the relative contrasts, spatial frequencies and directions of motion of the gratings. These effects may reveal the previously unstudied properties of a higher order stage of motion analysis."

The model exploits constraints provided by human psychophysics, notably that motion-sensing elements appear tuned for two-dimensional spatial frequency, and by the frequency spectrum of a moving image, namely, that its support lies in the plane in which the temporal frequency equals the dot product of the spatial frequency and the image velocity. The first stage of the model is a set of spatial-frequency-tuned, direction-selective linear sensors. The temporal frequency of the response of each sensor is shown to encode the component of the image velocity in the sensor direction. At the second stage, these components are resolved in order to measure the velocity of image motion at each of a number of spatial locations and spatial frequencies.

For example, if a person were to close one eye and look at an evenly illuminated, irregularly shaped object, he would be unlikely to guess its shape correctly. But if the object is moved about, the correct shape immediately becomes apparent9. Little is known about how the primate visual system actually does this, although various theories have been proposed7,8,10\u201315. We have developed novel, highly controlled motion stimuli to use with psychophysical and physiological techniques to study how 3-D structure is obtained from motion. We show that the Rhesus monkey can detect 3-D structure from motion in the same way as human subjects. Furthermore, the dependence of both species on certain parameters of the display shows that information is integrated both spatially and temporally for this higher visual function."

The zero crossings of \u22072G(x, y) \u2217 I(x, y) are located, as in Marr & Hildreth (1980). That is, the image is filtered through centre-surround receptive fields, and the zero values in the output are found. In addition, the time derivative \u2202[\u22072G(x, y) \u2217 l(x, y)]/\u2202t is measured at the zero crossings, and serves to constrain the local direction of motion to within 180\u00b0. The direction of motion can be determined in a second stage, for example by combining the local constraints. The second part of the paper suggests a specific model of the information processing by the X and Y cells of the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, and certain classes of cortical simple cells. A number of psychophysical and neurophysiological predictions are derived from the theory."

The output velocity is encoded as the peak in a distribution of velocity-tuned units that behave much like cells of the middle temporal area of the primate brain. The model appears to deal with the aperture problem as well as the human visual system since it extracts the correct velocity for patterns that have large differences in contrast at different spatial orientations, and it simulates psychophysical data on the coherence of sine-grating plaid patterns."

The spastial, temporal and other constraints governing this effect are markedly different from those classically found for the apparent motion of isolated stimulus elements. The random-dot display appears to tap a low-level motion-detecting process, distinct from the more interpretive process elicited by the classical displays. The distinct contributions of these processes can be identified in 'multi-stable' displays which yield alternative percepts of apparent motion depending on which one or both of the processes is activated. Such experiments illustrate the interaction of relatively stimulus-constrained and relatively autonomous processes invisual perception."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Consequently it may be appropriate to \nre-examine critically the origin and use of this century old \nconcept. This idea developed in the study of classical \nelectromagnetism at a time when it was considered \nappropriate to treat electric charge as a continuous \nsubstance. It is not obvious that general acceptance in \nthe early 1800's of the principle of the atomicity of \nelectric charge would have led to the field concept in \nits present form. Is it after all essential in classical field \ntheory to require that a particle act upon itself? Of \nquantum theories of fields and their possibilities we \nhardly know enough to demand on quantum grounds \nthat such a direct self-interaction should exist. Quantum \ntheory defines those possibilities of measurement which \nare consistent with the principle of complementarity, \nbut the measuring devices themselves after all necessarily \nmake use of classical concepts to specify the quantity \nmeasured. For this reason it is appropriate to begin \na re-analysis of the field concept by returning to classical \nelectrodynamics. We therefore propose here to go back \nto the great basic problem of classical physics-the \nmotion of a system of charged particles under the \ninfluence of electromagnetic forces-and to inquire \nwhat description of the interactions and motions is \npossible which is at the same time (1) well defined \n(2) economical in postulates and (3) in agreement with \nexperience."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."
