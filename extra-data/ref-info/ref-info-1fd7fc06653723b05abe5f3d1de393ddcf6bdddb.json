Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more long-distance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to re-score word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup."

Hybrid word/sub-word systems solve this problem by adding sub-word units to large vocabulary word based systems; new words can then be represented by combinations of sub-word units. Previous work heuristically created the sub-word lexicon from phonetic representations of text using simple statistics to select common phone sequences. We propose a probabilistic model to learn the subword lexicon optimized for a given task. We consider the task of out of vocabulary (OOV) word detection, which relies on output from a hybrid model. A hybrid model with our learned sub-word lexicon reduces error by 6.3% and 7.6% (absolute) at a 5% false alarm rate on an English Broadcast News and MIT Lectures task respectively."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

It makes use of a high degree of word compounding leading to high Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, and Language Model (LM) perplexities. For such languages the use of sub-lexical units for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) becomes a natural choice. In this paper, we investigate the use of mixed types of sub-lexical units in the same recognition lexicon. Namely, morphemic or syllabic units combined with pronunciations called graphones, normal graphemic morphemes or syllables along with full-words. This mixture of units is used for building hybrid LMs suitable for open vocabulary LVCSR where the system operates over an open, constantly changing vocabulary like in broadcast news, political debates, etc. A relative reduction of around 5.0% in Word Error Rate (WER) is obtained compared to a traditional full-words system. Moreover, around 40% of the OOVs are recognized. Index Terms: open vocabulary, morpheme, syllable, graphone"

In most documents, however, these rare words are not seen at all. The first type of words is typically included in the language model of an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) and is thus widely referred to as invocabulary (IV). Words of the second type are missing in the language model and thus are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV). However, these words usually carry important information. \n \nWe use a hybrid word/sub-word recognizer to detect OOV words occurring in English talks and describe them as sequences of sub-words. We detected about one third of all OOV words, and were able to recover the correct spelling for 26.2% of all detections by using a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) conversion trained on the recognition dictionary. By omitting detections corresponding to recovered IV words, we were able to increase the precision of the OOV detection substantially."

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

A PPM model estimates the next-symbol probabilit y distribution by combining statistics from the longest matching contiguous contexts in which each symbol value is found. We introduce a context mixing model which improves on PPM by allowing contexts which are arbitrary functions of the history. Each model independently estimates a probabilit y and confidence that the next bit of data will be 0 or 1. Predictions are combined by weighted averaging. After a bit is arithmetic coded, the weights are adjusted along the cost gradient in weight space to favor the most accurate models.
