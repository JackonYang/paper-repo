In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

This paper presents relationships between weak learning, weak prediction (where the probability of being correct is slightly larger than 50%), and consistency oracles (which decide whether or not a given set of examples is consistent with a concept in the class). Our main result is a simple polynomial prediction algorithm which makes only a single query to a consistency oracle and whose predictions have a polynomial edge over random guessing. We compare this prediction algorithm with several of the standard prediction techniques, deriving an improved worst case bound on Gibbs algorithm in the process. We use our algorithm to show that a concept class is polynomially learnable if and only if there is a polynomial probabilistic consistency oracle for the class. Since strong learning algorithms can be built from weak learning algorithms, our results also characterizes strong learnability."

This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201cbaseNP\u201d chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."
