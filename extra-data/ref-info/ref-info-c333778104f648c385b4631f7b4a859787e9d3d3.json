Systems were presented with pairs of sentences and were evaluated on their ability to predict human judgments on (i) semantic relatedness and (ii) entailment. The task attracted 21 teams, most of which participated in both subtasks. We received 17 submissions in the relatedness subtask (for a total of 66 runs) and 18 in the entailment subtask (65 runs)."

The scheme addresses three types of modification that license entailment patterns: restrictive, appositive and conjunctive, with a formal semantic specification of these patterns' contribution for establishing entailment. These inferential constructions were found to occur in 77.68% of the entailments in the RTE 1-3 corpora. They were annotated with cross-annotator agreement of 70.73% on average. A central aim of our annotations is to examine components that address these phenomena in RTE systems. Specifically, the new annotated dataset is used for examining a syntactic rule base within the BIUTEE recognizer, a publicly available entailment system. According to our tests, the rule base is rarely used to process the phenomena annotated in our corpus and most of the recognition work is done by other components in the system."

The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second.

The test data also comprised 2000 sentences pairs for those datasets, plus two surprise datasets with 400 pairs from a different machine translation evaluation corpus and 750 pairs from a lexical resource mapping exercise. The similarity of pairs of sentences was rated on a 0-5 scale (low to high similarity) by human judges using Amazon Mechanical Turk, with high Pearson correlation scores, around 90%. 35 teams participated in the task, submitting 88 runs. The best results scored a Pearson correlation >80%, well above a simple lexical baseline that only scored a 31% correlation. This pilot task opens an exciting way ahead, although there are still open issues, specially the evaluation metric."

We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense."

However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them."

Another important innovation introduced in this campaign was a three-judgment task, which required the systems to make a further distinction between pairs where the entailment does not hold because the content of H is contradicted by the content of T, and pairs where the entailment cannot be determined because the truth of H cannot be verified on the basis of the content of T. A classic twoway task was also offered. RTE-4 attracted 26 teams, more than half of whom submitted runs for the new 3-way task. This paper describes the preparation of the dataset, and gives an overview of the results achieved by the participating systems."

The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task."

Most current approaches to the PASCAL RTE textual inference task achieve robustness by sacrificing semantic precision; while broadly effective, they are easily confounded by ubiquitous inferences involving monotonicity. At the other extreme, systems which rely on first-order logic and theorem proving are precise, but excessively brittle. This work aims at a middle way. Our system finds a low-cost edit sequence which transforms the premise into the hypothesis; learns to classify entailment relations across atomic edits; and composes atomic entailments into a top-level entailment judgment. We provide the first reported results for any system on the FraCaS test suite. We also evaluate on RTE3 data, and show that hybridizing an existing RTE system with our natural logic system yields significant performance gains."

Our model significantly outperforms the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task."

While originally built for Java Enterprise Edition\u2013based applications, we have refactored the core of Taconite into a client-side library that can easily be used with any server-side technology. Beyond that, it wouldn\u2019t be terribly hard to port the Taconite serverside components to other technologies such as .NET. What makes Taconite so special? Ajax is a fantastic step forward in the evolution of the Web application. However, we\u2019ve struggled over the years with the inconsistencies among browsers and the difficulty inherent in developing massive quantities of JavaScript. Since we\u2019re basically lazy, we decided to just \u201cbuild it once\u201d so we could easily reuse our hard work. (Besides, we can tell our bosses it\u2019ll take three weeks, get it done in one, and spend the rest of the time following the trials and tribulations of the Minnesota Vikings.)
