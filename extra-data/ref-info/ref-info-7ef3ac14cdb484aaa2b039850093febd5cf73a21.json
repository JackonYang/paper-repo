The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request. Like all other documentalists who are operating large coordinate indexes, we are searching for better ways to exploit this type of information system. In our library we have already eliminated the time-consuming job of posting document numbers manually by enlisting the aid of a 705 computer. (The computer periodically prepares revised posting cards to replace the outdated ones.) Now we are searching for better solutions to our retrieval problems. One obvious retrieval problem in any large system is the time required to \"coordinate\" heavily posted terms. We are convinced we must mechanize if we are to allow our collection to grow indefinitely. A second problem is the retrieval of so many documents related to a single request that the customer finds it difficult to decide which to examine first. Since he has no precise means of determining which document is most closely related to a request, we have been forced into assisting him to use somewhat arbitrary or subjective means. The date of the document is sometimes used as a relevance criterion with the hope that the most recent document will be the most pertinent, or the name of the author is used with the hope that a known author will answer the request better than an unknown one. The pitfalls of such criteria are apparent. The third, and \u2026"

Linguists describe language instead, using a discontinuous or discrete mathematics called \u201clinguistics.\u201d The nature of this odd calculus is outlined and justified here. It treats speech communication as having a telegraphic structure. (Non\u2010linguists normally fail to orient themselves in this field because they treat speech as analogous to telephony.) The telegraph\u2010code structure of language is examined from top to bottom, and at each of its several levels of complexity (compared to the two levels of Morse code) its structure is shown to be defined by possibilities and impossibilities of combination among the units of that level. Above the highest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of occurrence: this is the semantic field, outside linguistics, where sociologists can work. Below the lowest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of phonetic quality: this is the phonetic field, outside linguistics, where physicists can work. Thus linguistics is peculiar among mathematical systems in that it abuts upon reality in two places instead of one. This statement is equivalent to defining a language as a symbolic system; that is, as a code."
