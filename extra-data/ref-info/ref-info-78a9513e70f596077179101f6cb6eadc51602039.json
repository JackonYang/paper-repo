A discriminative reranker requires a source of candidate parses for each sentence. This paper describes a simple yet novel method for constructing sets of 50-best parses based on a coarse-to-fine generative parser (Charniak, 2000). This method generates 50-best lists that are of substantially higher quality than previously obtainable. We used these parses as the input to a MaxEnt reranker (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002) that selects the best parse from the set of parses for each sentence, obtaining an f-score of 91.0% on sentences of length 100 or less."

In addition, we consider the problem of boot-strapping parsers when the manually parsed training material is in a different domain to either the raw sentences or the testing material. We show that boot-strapping continues to be useful, even though no manually produced parses from the target domain are used."

                "text": "This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser. The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 F-measure, a 13 relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation."

The major technical innovation is the use of a \"maximum-entropy-inspired\" model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events.

Parameter search with EM produces higher quality analyses than previously exhibited by unsupervised systems, giving the best published un-supervised parsing results on the ATIS corpus. Experiments on Penn treebank sentences of comparable length show an even higher F1 of 71% on non-trivial brackets. We compare distributionally induced and actual part-of-speech tags as input data, and examine extensions to the basic model. We discuss errors made by the system, compare the system to previous models, and discuss upper bounds, lower bounds, and stability for this task."

One problem is that much of the work on discriminative methods conflates changes to the learning method with changes to the parameterization of the problem. We show how a parser can be trained with a discriminative learning method while still parameterizing the problem according to a generative probability model. We present three methods for training a neural network to estimate the probabilities for a statistical parser, one generative, one discriminative, and one where the probability model is generative but the training criteria is discriminative. The latter model outperforms the previous two, achieving state-of-the-art levels of performance (90.1% F-measure on constituents)."

After the best parse tree has been computed using the CYK algorithm, a large number of alternative parse trees are obtained, in order by weight (or probability), in a small fraction of the time required by the CYK algorithm to find the best parse tree. This is confirmed by experimental results using grammars from two different domains: a chromosome grammar, and a grammar modeling natural language sentences from the Wall Street Journal corpus."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

Since the output of the taggers is noisy, there is a question of which newly labelled examples to add to the training set. We investigate selecting examples by directly maximising tagger agreement on unlabelled data, a method which has been theoretically and empirically motivated in the co-training literature. Our results show that agreement-based co-training can significantly improve tagging performance for small seed datasets. Further results show that this form of co-training considerably outperforms self-training. However, we find that simply re-training on all the newly labelled data can, in some cases, yield comparable results to agreement-based co-training, with only a fraction of the computational cost."
