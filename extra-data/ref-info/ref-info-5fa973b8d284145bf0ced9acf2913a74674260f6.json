By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus."

Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing $$\\sim $$\u223c0.25\u00a0M images, $$\\sim $$\u223c0.76\u00a0M questions, and $$\\sim $$\u223c10\u00a0M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided and compared with human performance. Our VQA demo is available on CloudCV (http://cloudcv.org/vqa)."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three components and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate our mQA model. It contains over 150,000 images and 310,000 freestyle Chinese question-answer pairs and their English translations. The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on the project page: this http URL"

                "text": "Artificial agents today can answer factual questions. But they fall short on questions that require common sense reasoning. Perhaps this is because most existing common sense databases rely on text to learn and represent knowledge. But much of common sense knowledge is unwritten - partly because it tends not to be interesting enough to talk about, and partly because some common sense is unnatural to articulate in text. While unwritten, it is not unseen. In this paper we leverage semantic common sense knowledge learned from images - i.e. visual common sense - in two textual tasks: fill-in-the-blank and visual paraphrasing. We propose to \u201cimagine\u201d the scene behind the text, and leverage visual cues from the \u201cimagined\u201d scenes in addition to textual cues while answering these questions. We imagine the scenes as a visual abstraction. Our approach outperforms a strong text-only baseline on these tasks. Our proposed tasks can serve as benchmarks to quantitatively evaluate progress in solving tasks that go \u201cbeyond recognition\u201d. Our code and datasets are publicly available."

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time."

Recent work in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) circumvents this challenge by describing categories via attributes or text. However, not all visual concepts, e.g., two people dancing, are easily amenable to such descriptions. In this paper, we propose a new modality for ZSL using visual abstraction to learn difficult-to-describe concepts. Specifically, we explore concepts related to people and their interactions with others. Our proposed modality allows one to provide training data by manipulating abstract visualizations, e.g., one can illustrate interactions between two clipart people by manipulating each person\u2019s pose, expression, gaze, and gender. The feasibility of our approach is shown on a human pose dataset and a new dataset containing complex interactions between two people, where we outperform several baselines. To better match across the two domains, we learn an explicit mapping between the abstract and real worlds."

We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented."

For example, given a relationship between a pair of entities e.g., `eat(horse, hay)', how can we know whether this relationship is true or false in general. Gathering such knowledge about entities and their relationships is one of the fundamental challenges in knowledge extraction. Most previous works on knowledge extraction have focused purely on text-driven reasoning for verifying relation phrases. In this work, we introduce the problem of visual verification of relation phrases and developed a Visual Knowledge Extraction system called VisKE. Given a verb-based relation phrase between common nouns, our approach assess its validity by jointly analyzing over text and images and reasoning about the spatial consistency of the relative configurations of the entities and the relation involved. Our approach involves no explicit human supervision thereby enabling large-scale analysis. Using our approach, we have already verified over 12000 relation phrases. Our approach has been used to not only enrich existing textual knowledge bases by improving their recall, but also augment open-domain question-answer reasoning."

To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity."

While some commonsense knowledge is explicitly stated in human-generated text and can be learnt by mining the web, much of it is unwritten. It is often unnecessary and even unnatural to write about commonsense facts. While unwritten, this commonsense knowledge is not unseen! The visual world around us is full of structure modeled by commonsense knowledge. Can machines learn common sense simply by observing our visual world? Unfortunately, this requires automatic and accurate detection of objects, their attributes, poses, and interactions between objects, which remain challenging problems. Our key insight is that while visual common sense is depicted in visual content, it is the semantic features that are relevant and not low-level pixel information. In other words, photorealism is not necessary to learn common sense. We explore the use of human-generated abstract scenes made from clipart for learning common sense. In particular, we reason about the plausibility of an interaction or relation between a pair of nouns by measuring the similarity of the relation and nouns with other relations and nouns we have seen in abstract scenes. We show that the commonsense knowledge we learn is complementary to what can be learnt from sources of text."

The representation automatically learns to remember long-term visual concepts. Our model is capable of both generating novel captions given an image, and reconstructing visual features given an image description. We evaluate our approach on several tasks. These include sentence generation, sentence retrieval and image retrieval. State-of-the-art results are shown for the task of generating novel image descriptions. When compared to human generated captions, our automatically generated captions are equal to or preferred by humans 21.0% of the time. Results are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art results on the image and sentence retrieval tasks for methods using similar visual features."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

Most current evaluations measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding. We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question. Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers, is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object, through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other uniquely instantiated objects."

                "text": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone\u2019s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today\u2019s computers and algorithms."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences' visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches."

We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a multi-world approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a bayesian framework. Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts, object classes, instances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages over real images. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of real images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of real images that are semantically similar would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract images with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity. Finally, we study the relation between the saliency and memorability of objects and their semantic importance."

In this paper, we present OQA, the first approach to leverage both curated and extracted KBs. A key technical challenge is designing systems that are robust to the high variability in both natural language questions and massive KBs. OQA achieves robustness by decomposing the full Open QA problem into smaller sub-problems including question paraphrasing and query reformulation. OQA solves these sub-problems by mining millions of rules from an unlabeled question corpus and across multiple KBs. OQA then learns to integrate these rules by performing discriminative training on question-answer pairs using a latent-variable structured perceptron algorithm. We evaluate OQA on three benchmark question sets and demonstrate that it achieves up to twice the precision and recall of a state-of-the-art Open QA system."

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \u201cdoubly deep\u201d in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \u201clayers\u201d. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized."

Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision."

We develop two forms of visual annotator rationales: in the first, the annotator highlights the spatial region of interest he found most influential to the label selected, and in the second, he comments on the visual attributes that were most important. For either case, we show how to map the response to synthetic contrast examples, and then exploit an existing large-margin learning technique to refine the decision boundary accordingly.

                "text": "This article proposes a multimedia analysis framework to process video and text jointly for understanding events and answering user queries. The framework produces a parse graph that represents the compositional structures of spatial information (objects and scenes), temporal information (actions and events), and causal information (causalities between events and fluents) in the video and text. The knowledge representation of the framework is based on a spatial-temporal-causal AND-OR graph (S/T/C-AOG), which jointly models possible hierarchical compositions of objects, scenes, and events as well as their interactions and mutual contexts, and specifies the prior probabilistic distribution of the parse graphs. The authors present a probabilistic generative model for joint parsing that captures the relations between the input video/text, their corresponding parse graphs, and the joint parse graph. Based on the probabilistic model, the authors propose a joint parsing system consisting of three modules: video parsing, text parsing, and joint inference. Video parsing and text parsing produce two parse graphs from the input video and text, respectively. The joint inference module produces a joint parse graph by performing matching, deduction, and revision on the video and text parse graphs. The proposed framework has the following objectives: to provide deep semantic parsing of video and text that goes beyond the traditional bag-of-words approaches; to perform parsing and reasoning across the spatial, temporal, and causal dimensions based on the joint S/T/C-AOG representation; and to show that deep joint parsing facilitates subsequent applications such as generating narrative text descriptions and answering queries in the forms of who, what, when, where, and why. The authors empirically evaluated the system based on comparison against ground-truth as well as accuracy of query answering and obtained satisfactory results."

The teacher then provides a label for only that instance. This is quite restrictive. In this paper, we propose a learning paradigm in which the learner communicates its belief (i.e. predicted label) about the actively chosen example to the teacher. The teacher then confirms or rejects the predicted label. More importantly, if rejected, the teacher communicates an explanation for why the learner's belief was wrong. This explanation allows the learner to propagate the feedback provided by the teacher to many unlabeled images. This allows a classifier to better learn from its mistakes, leading to accelerated discriminative learning of visual concepts even with few labeled images. In order for such communication to be feasible, it is crucial to have a language that both the human supervisor and the machine learner understand. Attributes provide precisely this channel. They are human-interpretable mid-level visual concepts shareable across categories e.g. \"furry\", \"spacious\", etc. We advocate the use of attributes for a supervisor to provide feedback to a classifier and directly communicate his knowledge of the world. We employ a straightforward approach to incorporate this feedback in the classifier, and demonstrate its power on a variety of visual recognition scenarios such as image classification and annotation. This application of attributes for providing classifiers feedback is very powerful, and has not been explored in the community. It introduces a new mode of supervision, and opens up several avenues for future research."

It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and the image. Image descriptions are generated by sampling from this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on three benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, and Flickr 30K). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art generative method. In addition, the m-RNN model can be applied to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval."

Vision is used to decide everything from what we want to eat at a restaurant and which bus route to take to whether our clothes match and how long until the milk expires. Individually, the inability to interpret such visual information is a nuisance for blind people who often have effective, if inefficient, work-arounds to overcome them. Collectively, however, they can make blind people less independent. Specialized technology addresses some problems in this space, but automatic approaches cannot yet answer the vast majority of visual questions that blind people may have. VizWiz addresses this shortcoming by using the Internet connections and cameras on existing smartphones to connect blind people and their questions to remote paid workers' answers. VizWiz is designed to have low latency and low cost, making it both competitive with expensive automatic solutions and much more versatile."

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

                "text": "Active learning provides useful tools to reduce annotation costs without compromising classifier performance. However it traditionally views the supervisor simply as a labeling machine. Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e.g. \"I think this is a forest, what do you think?\". If the learner is wrong, the supervisor provides an explanation e.g. \"No, this is too open to be a forest\". With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label-but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

Current access technology uses automatic approaches to address some problems in this space, but the technology is error-prone, limited in scope, and quite expensive. In this paper, we introduce VizWiz, a talking application for mobile phones that offers a new alternative to answering visual questions in nearly real-time - asking multiple people on the web. To support answering questions quickly, we introduce a general approach for intelligently recruiting human workers in advance called quikTurkit so that workers are available when new questions arrive. A field deployment with 11 blind participants illustrates that blind people can effectively use VizWiz to cheaply answer questions in their everyday lives, highlighting issues that automatic approaches will need to address to be useful. Finally, we illustrate the potential of using VizWiz as part of the participatory design of advanced tools by using it to build and evaluate VizWiz::LocateIt, an interactive mobile tool that helps blind people solve general visual search problems."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

To overcome a lack of densely annotated spatiotemporal data, we learn from sequences of abstract images gathered using crowd-sourcing.

Whereas feed-forward networks only exploit a fixed context length to predict the next word of a sequence, conceptually, standard recurrent neural networks can take into account all of the predecessor words. On the other hand, it is well known that recurrent networks are difficult to train and therefore are unlikely to show the full potential of recurrent models. These problems are addressed by a the Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture. In this work, we analyze this type of network on an English and a large French language modeling task. Experiments show improvements of about 8 % relative in perplexity over standard recurrent neural network LMs. In addition, we gain considerable improvements in WER on top of a state-of-the-art speech recognition system."

This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30% of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work."

We present HunPos, a free and open source (LGPL-licensed) alternative, which can be tuned by the user to fully utilize the potential of HMM architectures, offering performance comparable to more complex models, but preserving the ease and speed of the training and tagging process."

Not only do these features generalize poorly, but the cost of feature computation restricts parsing speed significantly. In this work, we propose a novel way of learning a neural network classifier for use in a greedy, transition-based dependency parser. Because this classifier learns and uses just a small number of dense features, it can work very fast, while achieving an about 2% improvement in unlabeled and labeled attachment scores on both English and Chinese datasets. Concretely, our parser is able to parse more than 1000 sentences per second at 92.2% unlabeled attachment score on the English Penn Treebank."
