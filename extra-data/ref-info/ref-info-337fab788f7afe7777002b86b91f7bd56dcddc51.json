The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is based on 'visual similarity' of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier, given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of tex and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures, variations in the point size of fonts, the density of content area, and various statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings."

Searching for documents by their type is a natural way to enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval in the workplace [2], and a such system is proposed in [4]. The goal of our work is to build classifiers that can determine the type or genre of a document image. We use primarily layout features since the layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to identify a document\u2019s type. Layout analysis is necessary since our input image has no structural definition that is immediately perceivable by a computer. Classification is thus based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of the structure without reference to models of particular kinds of pages. There has been some classification work reported but most require either domain specific models [3, 5, 6, 8] or are based on text obtained by optical character recognition (OCR) [3, 6, 8]."

By analyzing a document\u2019s layout and conceptual structures, we present in this paper a sample-based approach to document classification. We represent a document\u2019s layout structure by an ordered labeled tree through a procedure known as nested segmentation and represent the document\u2019s conceptual structure by a set of attribute type pairs. The layout similarities between the document to be classified and sample documents are determined by a previously developed approximate tree matching toolkit. The conceptual similarities between the documents are determined by analyzing their contents and by calculating the degree of conceptual closeness. The document type is identified by computing both the layout and conceptual similarities between the document to be classified and the samples in the document sample base. Some experimental results are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."

We develop a document 'handle' which is stored along with the document image. The handle is simply a character shape coded representation of the image after the figures and tables have ben removed. Character shape coding is a method of identifying individual character images as members of one of a small number of classes. This process is computationally inexpensive and tolerant of differing generations of photocopying, skew and scanner characteristics. When a new document is entered into the system, its handle is computed and compared against al of the extant handles using a normalized Levenshtein metric. We demonstrate the ability to detect duplicate documents comprising single and multiple pages."

In the OISs, document classification is one of the major functional capabilities. Classifying a document can be facilitated through the layout analysis of the document. A new approach to the layout analysis, called nested segmentation, is introduced. The layout relationships of components of a document are defined in terms of the adjacency of blocks. Given the adjacency of blocks, an adjacent block graph is introduced where the problem of the nested segmentation is transformed to a classic minimal cut problem for the graph. Also, an ordered labeled tree structure (L-S-Tree) is introduced to represent the segmented document for document classification.<<ETX>>"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Instead of top-down determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood). The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations from a neighborhood. Consequently, heuristics are learned for structurally discriminating documents during subsequent classification.<<ETX>>"

The IDIR system will provide close connections with and utilization of document analysis and image processing techniques, advanced computing and networking, and modern approaches to database management. The system design consists of aggressively modularized components to enhance the development of individual parts which are used in the complete solution, including: Interface speciications, multipurpose feature extraction, an integrated eecient query language, physical retrieval from an object-oriented database, and delivery of retrieved objects. In this paper, we introduce the general framework, feature extraction modules, query capabilities, a graphical query interface, and the application interface. We demonstrate each component of the system and how the query mechanisms can be used to handle both content and structural queries eeectively."

It is the author's job to design the document so that the information it contains can be interpreted accurately and efficiently. To do this, the author can make use of a set of stylistic tools. In this paper, we introduce the concept of document functionality, which attempts to describe the roles of documents and their components in the process of transferring information. A functional description of a document provides insight into the type of the document, into its intended uses, and into strategies for automatic document interpretation and retrieval. To demonstrate these ideas, we define a taxonomy of functional document components and show how functional descriptions can be used to reverse-engineer the intentions of the author, to navigate in document space, and to provide important contextual information to aid in interpretation."

To justify the approach and test the scalability, we have developed a simulator which allows us to change parameters of the system and examine performance for millions of document signatures.

It is based on document image texture analysis. The algorithm consists of three steps. First candidate thresholds are produced from the gray scale histogram analysis. Then, texture features associated with each candidate threshold are computed from the corresponding run-length histogram. Finally, the optimal threshold is selected according to the goodness evaluation so that the most desirable document texture features are produced. Only one pass through an image is required for optimal threshold selection. The test set consisted of 9000 machine printed address blocks from an unconstrained U.S. mail stream. Over 99.6% of the images were visually well-binarized. In an objective test, a system run with 594 mail address blocks, which contains many difficult images, shows that an 8.1% higher character recognition rate was achieved, compared to that by a previous algorithm due to Otsu."

Such trees have many applications in vision, pattern recognition, molecular biology, programming compilation, and natural language processing. Many of the applications involve comparing trees or retrieving/extracting information from a repository of trees. Examples include classification of unknown patterns, analysis of newly sequenced RNA structures, semantic taxonomy for dictionary definitions, generation of interpreters for nonprocedural programming languages, and automatic error recovery and correction for programming languages. Previous systems use exact matching (or generalized regular expression matching) for tree comparison. This paper presents a system, called approximate-tree-by-example (ATBE), which allows inexact matching of trees. The ATBE system interacts with the user through a simple but powerful query language; graphical devices are provided to facilitate inputing the queries. The paper describes the architecture of ATBE, illustrates its use and describes some aspects of ATBE implementation. We also discuss the underlying algorithms and provide some sample applications. >"

The basic operation in query-by-content will be ranking portions of the database with respect to similarity with the query. What kind of similarity measure should be used is a problem we begin exploring in this paper. We let psychological experiments guide us in the quest for a good similarity measure, and devise a measure derived from a set-theoretic measure proposed in the psychological literature, modified by the introduction of fuzzy logic."

Since a binarization process is inherently lossy, different algorithms typically produce different binary images from the same gray scale image. The objective of this research is to study effects of global binarization algorithms on the performance of OCR systems. Several binarization methods were examined: the best fixed threshold value for the data set, the ideal histogram method, and Otsu's algorithm. Four contemporary OCR systems and 50 hard copy pages containing 91,649 characters were used in the experiments. These pages were digitized at 300 dpi and 8 bits/pixel, and 36 different threshold values (ranging from 59 to 199 in increments of 4) were used. The resulting 1,800 binary images were processed by all four OCR systems. All systems made approximately 40% more errors from images generated by Otsu's method than those of the ideal histogram method. Two of the systems made approximately the same number of errors from images generated by the best fixed threshold value and Otsu's method."

In this paper the derivation of \u201cClassic\u201d MaxEnt is completed, showing that it leads to a natural choice for the regularising parameter \u03b1, that supersedes the traditional practice of setting x2=N. The new condition is that the dimensionless measure of structure -2\u03b1S should be equal to the number of good singular values contained in the data. The performance of this new condition is discussed with reference to image deconvolution, but leads to a reconstruction that is visually disappointing. A deeper hypothesis space is proposed that overcomes these difficulties, by allowing for spatial correlations across the image."

This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees."
