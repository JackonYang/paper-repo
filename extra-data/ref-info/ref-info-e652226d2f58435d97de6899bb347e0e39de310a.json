                "text": "This paper presents a novel end-to-end system for table understanding in document images called DeepDeSRT. In particular, the contribution of DeepDeSRT is two-fold. First, it presents a deep learning-based solution for table detection in document images. Secondly, it proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for table structure recognition, i.e. identifying rows, columns, and cell positions in the detected tables. In contrast to existing rule-based methods, which rely on heuristics or additional PDF metadata (like, for example, print instructions, character bounding boxes, or line segments), the presented system is data-driven and does not need any heuristics or metadata to detect as well as to recognize tabular structures in document images. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing table detection and structure recognition methods, which are applicable only to PDFs, DeepDeSRT processes document images, which makes it equally suitable for born-digital PDFs (as they can automatically be converted into images) as well as even harder problems, e.g. scanned documents. To gauge the performance of DeepDeSRT, the system is evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 table competition dataset containing 67 documents with 238 pages overall. Evaluation results reveal that DeepDeSRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods for table detection and structure recognition and achieves F1-measures of 96.77% and 91.44% for table detection and structure recognition, respectively. Additionally, DeepDeSRT is evaluated on a closed dataset from a real use case of a major European aviation company comprising documents which are highly unlike those in ICDAR 2013. Tested on a randomly selected sample from this dataset, DeepDeSRT achieves high detection accuracy for tables which demonstrates the sound generalization capabilities of our system."

Given a line-segmented document, the extraction of table is considered as a labeling task that consists in assigning a label to each line: Table Row label for a line which belongs to a table and Line Text label for a line which belongs to a text block. To perform the labeling task, we use a CRF model to combine two classifiers: a local classifier which assigns a label to the line based on local features and a contextual classifier which uses features taking into account the neighborhood. The CRF model gives the global conditional probability of a given labeling of the line considering the outputs of the two classifiers. A set of chemistry documents is used for the evaluation of this approach. The obtained results are around 88% of table lines correctly detected."

Moreover, variations between documents are important even for documents having a priori the same structure. A recognition system to overcome these difficulties requires external knowledge. Therefore we present a recognition system using a user description. To use table descriptions in analyzing the image, our system uses the intersections of two rulings with a close extremity of one or each of these two rulings. We present some results to show how our system can recognize tables with a general description and how it can deal with noise with a more precise description."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form.Their rich combination of formatting and content present difficulties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells."

The documents of interest are composed of a table of personal information in which the cells containing the first name, the surname and the relation to head of household must be extracted and recognized. More than 30 millions of cells were processed and their content either directly integrated into the information system or sent to keyers for manual validation, allowing an automation rate at 80% while keeping the error rate below 15% on average. Based on this project, we have started the development of a generic platform for table-based historical documents processing including new functionalities and a more generic and user-friendly table model definition interface."

In this paper document analysis is applied to snippets of torn documents to calculate features that can be used for reconstruction. The main intention is to handle snippets of varying size and different contents (e.g. handwritten or printed text). Documents can either be destroyed by the intention to make the printed content unavailable (e.g. business crime) or due to time induced degeneration of ancient documents (e.g. bad storage conditions). Current reconstruction methods for manually torn documents deal with the shape, or e.g. inpainting and texture synthesis techniques. In this paper the potential of document analysis techniques of snippets to support a reconstruction algorithm by considering additional features is shown. This implies a rotational analysis, a color analysis, a line detection, a paper type analysis (checked, lined, blank) and a classification of the text (printed or hand written). Preliminary results show that these features can be determined reliably on a real dataset consisting of 690 snippets."

Our motivation for extending the library consists in addressing Document Understanding (DU) tasks by collectively classifying the objects present on one or several pages, jointly considering textual objects and objects of other nature like table or images or whatever object can be recognized. The logical constraints are meant to reflect prior knowledge on the DU task. We focus here on the improvement made over PyStruct, giving practical information as well. We also present a reproducible experiment. This new library is publicly available on GitHub under the Simplified BSD License."

Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link prediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to handle the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved through the use of an R-GCN encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

                "text": "\n \n Collective inference is widely used to improve classification in network datasets. However, despite recent advances in deep learning and the successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), researchers have only just recently begun to study how to apply RNNs to heterogeneous graph and network datasets. There has been recent work on using RNNs for unsupervised learning in networks (e.g., graph clustering, node embedding) and for prediction (e.g., link prediction, graph classification), but there has been little work on using RNNs for node-based relational classification tasks. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end learning framework using RNNs for collective inference. Our main insight is to transform a node and its set of neighbors into an unordered sequence (of varying length) and use an LSTM-based RNN to predict the class label as the output of that sequence. We develop a collective inference method, which we refer to as Deep Collective Inference (DCI), that uses semi-supervised learning in partially-labeled networks and two label distribution correction mechanisms for imbalanced classes. We compare to several alternative methods on seven network datasets. DCI achieves up to a 12% reduction in error compared to the best alternative and a 25% reduction in error on average \u2014 over all methods, for all label proportions.\n \n"

The outline of this method is described as follows. Ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. These lines are used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each line in the input image of a form as expected to correspond to a line in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for poor quality document images and also for various styles of forms."

Nevertheless, some existing approaches do not use the features of neighbouring vertices properly, due to the noise introduced by these features. In this paper, we propose a graph-based recursive neural network framework for collective vertex classification. In this framework, we generate hidden representations from both attributes of vertices and representations of neighbouring vertices via recursive neural networks. Under this framework, we explore two types of recursive neural units, naive recursive neural unit and long short-term memory unit. We have conducted experiments on four real-world network datasets. The experimental results show that our frame- work with long short-term memory model achieves better results and outperforms several competitive baseline methods."

Different from other previous research efforts, we adopt a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly, instead of using the sampling-based method for generating linear sequences proposed by Perozzi et al. (2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical perspectives. We also give a new perspective for the matrix factorization method proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014), in which the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix is considered as an analytical solution to the objective function of the skip-gram model with negative sampling proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). Unlike their approach which involves the use of the SVD for finding the low-dimensitonal projections from the PMI matrix, however, the stacked denoising autoencoder is introduced in our model to extract complex features and model non-linearities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on clustering and visualization tasks, employing the learned vertex representations as features. Empirical results on datasets of varying sizes show that our model outperforms other stat-of-the-art models in such tasks.\n \n"

                "text": "Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."

We provide a solution to the problem of matching two trees by constructing the association graph using the graph-theoretic concept of connectivity. We prove that, in the new formulation, there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal cliques and maximal subtree isomorphisms. This allows us to cast the tree matching problem as an indefinite quadratic program using the Motzkin-Straus theorem, and we use \"replicator\" dynamical systems developed in theoretical biology to solve it. Such continuous solutions to discrete problems are attractive because they can motivate analog and biological implementations. The framework is also extended to the matching of attributed trees by using weighted association graphs. We illustrate the power of the approach by matching articulated and deformed shapes described by shock trees."
