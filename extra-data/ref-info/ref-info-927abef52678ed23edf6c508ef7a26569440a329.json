First, we describe a general client/server architecture used in learning from observation. Then we give a detailed description of our novel decision-tree tagging approach. RoboTag performance for the proper noun tagging task in English and Japanese is compared against humantagged keys and to the best hand-coded pattern performance (as reported in the MUC and MET evaluation results). Related work and future directions are presented. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The ability to tag proper names such as organization, person, and place names in multilingual texts has great value for tasks like information extraction, information retrieval, and machine translation (Aone, Charocopos, and Gorlinsky, 1997). The most successful systems currently rely on handcoded patterns to identify the desired names in texts (Adv, 1995; Def, 1996). This approach achieves its best performance using different handcoded rule sets for each language/domain pair. Several of these systems have improved in ease of use, particularly in the speed of the write pattern/evaluate performance/refine pattern loop which plays the central role in the development process. One approach in name tagging is to assist in the creation of hand-coded rules by making it easier for the developer to mark parts of the name and its surrounding context to include in the pattern. This boosts productivity in hand-coding rules but still requires a significant amount of effort by the developer to identify key parts of the pattern. A step up from this is to determine how to generalize the rule so that it is more broadly applicable or to suggest to the developer which parts of the context have highvalue for inclusion in the pattern. Nevertheless, a skilled developer with a thorough knowledge of the particular pattern language is still essential. Our goal in developing RoboTag was to make it possible for an end-user to build a tagging system simply by giving examples of what should be tagged, rather than requiring the user to understand a pattern language. RoboTag uses a machine learning algorithm to discover features that the training examples have in common. This knowledge is used to construct a tagging procedure that can find additional, previously unseen examples for extraction. It was important (for the confidence of our users) that the tagging procedure induced by the system be easily explained in terms of how it makes its decisions. This was one of the factors that led us to consider using decision trees (Quinlan, 1993) as a key component of the system. Other potential learning or statistical approaches for a problem like this (e.g., Neural Nets or Hidden Markov Models) did not offer this advantage. The RoboTag system is particularly well instrumented for exploration of different learning system parameters and inspection of the induced tagging procedures. First, we discuss the overall architecture for the l~oboTag system. Next, we focus on the machine learning algorithm employed for tag learning. We then present experimental results which compare RoboTag to both human-tagged keys and to the best hand-coded rule systems. Lastly, related work and future directions are discussed. 2 RoboTag Architecture RoboTag design was motivated by our goal of developing an interactive learning system. The system had to process a large number of texts as well as provide the ability to visualize learning results and allow feedback to the learning system. To this end, RoboTag was designed as a client/server architecture. The client interface is an enhancement of a manual annotation tool. The interface works with multiple languages and includes support for both singleand double-byte coding schemes. We focus on English and Japanese in this paper. The server por-"

This paper reports our experiments in predicting parts of speech of highly ambiguous words, predicting the intended interpretation of an utterance when more than one interpretation satisfies all known syntactic and semantic constraints, and learning caseframe informationfor verbsfrom example uses.From these experiments, we are convinced that probabilistic models based on annotated corpora can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire lexical informationfrom a corpus, by supplementing knowledge-based techniques.Based on the results of those experiments, we have constructed a new natural language system (PLUM) for extracting data from text, e.g., newswire text."

For the Named Entity task, SRA adapted a subset of NameTag's capabilities to the MUC-6 specification. For the Template Element task, SRA fed the full results of NameTag into HASTEN, which performed additional processing to extract and generate the organization and person templates. For the Scenario Template task, SRA fed NameTag's results into HASTEN, which used its full extraction capabilities to extract and generate the management succession templates. Figure 1 illustrates the contribution of each system to the MUC-6 tasks. Due to the relative complexity of the scenario template task, this paper will focus on HASTEN and the experimental results for scenario extraction, and will provide brief descriptions of NameTag and the other tasks."

In order to do such an analysis, a method of computer intensive hypothesis testing was developed by SAIC for the MUC-3 results and has been used for distinguishing MUC scores since that time. The implementation of this method for the MUC evaluations was first described in [1] and later the concepts behind the statistical model were explained in a more understandable manner in [2]. This paper gives the results of the statistical testing for the three MUC-6 tasks where a single metric could be associated with a system's performance."

The FASTUS system was originally developed for participation in the MUC-4 evaluation [3] in 1992, and the performance of FASTUS in MUC-4 helped demonstrate the viability of finite state technologies in constrained natural-language understanding tasks. The system has undergone significant revision since MUC-4, and it is safe to say that the current system does not share a single line of code with the original. The fundamental ideas behind FASTUS, however, are retained in the current system: an architecture consisting of cascaded finite state transducers, each providing an additional level of analysis of the input, together with merging of the final results."

The sample was drawn from randomly selected set of 27 online discussion groups from both the Internet and from commercial information services (e.g. Compuserv) using the ProjectH dataset. The 2692 valid messages were coded for language content (fact, apology, first person flaming, status, etc.) that has been related to gender role in other research. Each message was also coded regarding the gender of its author. Results held with the conventional impression that men far outnumber women as participants in online discussion groups. However, results were mixed in regard to the relation of language patterns and group gender composition. Gender composition was related to patterns of computer mediated communication in this context. However, there were an unexpectedly high proportion of participants of indeterminate gender in this dataset, it is difficult to test the hypotheses with precision. However, the sample is comprised of \u201creal-life\u201d groups, so what is lost in experimental control is compensated for in generalization to other uncontrolled settings."

Through a comparison of these two communities using the typology, revisions to the typology are proposed which will allow it to reflect more accurately activities found within the communities.

                "text": "The role of community-based cancer support groups (CSGs) in helping people cope with cancer is well known. Recently, online CSGs have become a viable alternative to traditional CSGs. The purposes of this study were to determine if categories of responses on Internet cancer support groups (ICSGs) differ when the majority of the participants were of a single gender, and whether response categories seen on gender-specific ICSGs were different than those on ICSGs used equally by men and women. A line-by-line analysis of postings on prostate, breast, and mixed ICSGs were analyzed and responses categorized. Four categories (information giving/seeking; encouragement/support; personal opinion; and personal experience) accounted for approximately 80% of responses across the groups. Information giving/seeking was ranked first in the prostate group, and personal experience took priority in the breast group. Men were more than twice as likely to give information and women more than twice as likely to give encouragement and support. One category (prayer), identified in the mixed group, was lacking in the prostate and breast groups, and an activism category was added to the prostate group. Categorical responses differed by gender (chi 2 = 79.40, P < .0001). Attention should be given to facilitating the entry of underserved groups into ICSGs. Future research should explore the relationship between ICSG membership and variables such as depression, survival time, and quality of life."
