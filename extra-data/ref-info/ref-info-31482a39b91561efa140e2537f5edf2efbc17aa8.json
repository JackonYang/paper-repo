In this paper we examine the feasibility of a data- independent approach to construct such a visual vocabulary, where the feature space is discretized using a regular lattice. Using hashing techniques, only non-empty bins are stored, and fine-grained grids become possible in spite of the high dimensionality of typical feature spaces. Based on this representation, we can explore the structure of the feature space, and obtain state-of-the-art pixelwise classification results. In the case of image classification, we introduce a class-specific feature selection step, which takes the spatial structure of SIFT-like descriptors into account. Results are reported on the Graz02 dataset."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

They are highly discriminant and have good resistance to local occlusions and to geometric and photometric variations, but they are not able to exploit spatial co-occurrence statistics at scales larger than their local input patches. We present a new multilevel visual representation, \u2018hyperfeatures', that is designed to remedy this. The starting point is the familiar notion that to detect object parts, in practice it often suffices to detect co-occurrences of more local object fragments \u2013 a process that can be formalized as comparison (e.g. vector quantization) of image patches against a codebook of known fragments, followed by local aggregation of the resulting codebook membership vectors to detect co-occurrences. This process converts local collections of image descriptor vectors into somewhat less local histogram vectors \u2013 higher-level but spatially coarser descriptors. We observe that as the output is again a local descriptor vector, the process can be iterated, and that doing so captures and codes ever larger assemblies of object parts and increasingly abstract or \u2018semantic' image properties. We formulate the hyperfeatures model and study its performance under several different image coding methods including clustering based Vector Quantization, Gaussian Mixtures, and combinations of these with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We find that the resulting high-level features provide improved performance in several object image and texture image classification tasks."

We r st evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classier s. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the inuence of background correlations on recognition performance."

The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means.

To this end, we introduce a novel \"proximity distribution kernel\" that naturally combines local geometric as well as photometric information from images. It satisfies Mercer's condition and can therefore be readily combined with a support vector machine to perform visual categorization in a way that is insensitive to photometric and geometric variations, while retaining significant discriminative power. In particular, it improves on the results obtained both with geometrically unconstrained \"bags of features\" approaches, as well as with over-constrained \"affine procrustes.\" Indeed, we test this approach on several challenging data sets, including Graz-01, Graz-02, and the PASCAL challenge. We registered the average performance at 91.5% on Graz-01, 82.7% on Graz-02, and 74.5% on PASCAL. Our approach is designed to enforce and exploit geometric consistency among objects in the same category; therefore, it does not improve the performance of existing algorithms on datasets where the data is already roughly aligned and scaled. Our method has the potential to be extended to more complex geometric relationships among local features, as we illustrate in the experiments."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Our method learns object models in a weakly-supervised fashion, without requiring the specification of object locations nor pixel masks in the training data. We represent object models as cliques of fully-interconnected parts, exploiting only the pairwise geometric relationships between them. The use of pairwise relationships enables our algorithm to successfully overcome several problems that are common to previously-published methods. Even though our algorithm can easily incorporate local appearance information from richer features, we purposefully do not use them in order to demonstrate that simple geometric relationships can match (or exceed) the performance of state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

The proposed representation is thus richer and more robust to background clutter. Experimental results show that our approach improves the results of one of the best current image classification techniques. Furthermore, we propose to apply the spatial model to object localization.

We feed our descriptors to a graph-cuts based dense depth map estimation algorithm and this yields better wide-baseline performance than the commonly used correlation windows for which the size is hard to tune. As a result, unlike competing techniques that require many high-resolution images to produce good reconstructions, our descriptor can compute them from pairs of low-quality images such as the ones captured by video streams. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance. Our approach was tested with ground truth laser scanned depth maps as well as on a wide variety of image pairs of different resolutions and we show that good reconstructions are achieved even with only two low quality images."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

Our method has three distinct advantages: 1) It is computationally superior to the conventional approach. The integral histogram method makes it possible to employ even an exhaustive search process in real-time, which was impractical before. 2) It can be extended to higher data dimensions, uniform and nonuniform bin formations, and multiple target scales without sacrificing its computational advantages. 3) It enables the description of higher level histogram features. We exploit the spatial arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either a scan-line or a wave-front. At each step, we update a single bin using the values of integral histogram at the previously visited neighboring data points. After the integral histogram is propagated, histogram of any target region can be computed easily by using simple arithmetic operations."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

Estimating the model entails computing occurrence matrices. We introduce a generalization of the integral image and integral histogram frameworks, and prove that it can be used to dramatically speed up occurrence computation. We demonstrate the ability of this framework to recognize an individual walking across a network of cameras. Finally, we show that the proposed approach outperforms several other methods."

Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

Most existing categorization approaches have been tested on databases, which (a) either show the object(s) of interest in a very prominent way so that their localization can hardly be judged from these experiments, or (b) at least the learning procedure was done with supervision, which forces the system to learn only object relevant data. These approaches cannot be directly compared to a nearly unsupervised method. The main contribution of our paper thus is twofold: First, we have set up a new database which is sufficiently complex, balanced with respect to background, and includes localization ground truth. Second, we show, how our successful approach for generic object recognition [14] can be extended to perform localization, too.To analyze its localization potential, we develop localization measures which focus on approaches based on Boosting [5].

Unlike most current localization methods, our approach does not require any hypothesis parameter space to be defined. Instead, it directly generates, evaluates and clusters shape masks. Thus, the presented framework produces more informative results for object class localization. For example, it easily learns and detects possible object viewpoints and articulations, which are often well characterized by the object outline. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging natural-scene Graz-02 object classes dataset. The results demonstrate the extended localization capabilities of our method."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

We show that this restriction is, at least in theory, unnecessary, as one can construct local features that are viewpoint-invariant for generic non-planar scenes. However, we show that any such feature necessarily sacrifices shape information, in the sense of being non shape-discriminative. Finally, we show that if viewpoint is factored out as part of the matching process, rather than explicitly in the representation, then shape is discriminative indeed. We illustrate our theoretical results empirically by showing that, even for simple scenes, current affine descriptors fail where even a naive 3-D viewpoint invariant succeeds in matching"

We derive an alternating minimization procedure for simultaneously learning codebooks in the Euclidean feature space and in the simplex of posterior class distributions. The resulting quantizer can be used to encode unlabeled points outside the training set and to predict their posterior class distributions, and has an elegant interpretation in terms of universal lossless coding. The promise of our method is demonstrated for the application of learning discriminative visual vocabularies for bag-of-features image classification."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

We utilize Maximization of Mutual Information (MMI) co-clustering approach to discover clusters of semantic concepts, which we call intermediate concepts. Each intermediate concept corresponds to a cluster of visterms in the bag of Vis- terms (BOV) paradigm for scene classification. MMI co- clustering results in fewer but meaningful clusters. Unlike k-means which is used to cluster image patches based on their appearances in BOV, MMI co-clustering can group the visterms which are highly correlated to some concept. Unlike probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), which can be considered as one-sided soft clustering, MMI co- clustering simultaneously clusters visterms and images, so it is able to boost both clustering. In addition, the MMI co- clustering is an unsupervised method. We have extensively tested our proposed approach on two challenging datasets: the fifteen scene categories and the LSCOM dataset, and promising results are obtained."

Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

We present a novel non-parametric background model and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle situations where the background of the scene is cluttered and not completely static but contains small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. We also show how the model can use color information to suppress detection of shadows. The implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm rates."

Examples include principal component analysis (as used for instance in 'eigen-faces'), independent component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."
