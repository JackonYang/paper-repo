As a background we shall present in the following sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand, no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language. Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects. (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat unexpected shift from \"lemmatization\" to \"disambiguation\" will be justified in the sections to come.) Based on"

Psychologists have not often explored the nature of polysemy, and lexicographers' methods have not involved scientific sampling of usages or informants. It is argued, however, that the lexicographic technique of citation sorting is an effective way of discovering sense differences. Here this technique was used in three tasks involving usage samples for 24 high- and low-frequency nouns varying widely in degree of polysemy in the dictionary. Analyses of agreement within and between subjects showed that subjects consistently judged and substantially agreed upon the major senses of most nouns, but that few nouns in either frequency group were perceived to have more than three significant senses. Additionally, the possibility that larger usage samples will bias people to make more sense groupings was found not to be true, suggesting that the larger number of senses lexicographers create for high-frequency words are not artifacts of larger usage samples."

This approach exploits the differences between mappings of words to senses in different languages. We concentrate on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable, and employ a statistical model for the selection mechanism. The model was evaluated using two sets of Hebrew and German examples and was found to be very useful for disambiguation."

In addition to certain anchor points that are available in our data, the only information about the sentences that we use for calculating alignments is the number of tokens that they contain. Because we make no use of the lexical details of the sentence, the alignment computation is fast and therefore practical for application to very large collections of text. We have used this technique to align several million sentences in the English-French Hansard corpora and have achieved an accuracy in excess of 99% in a random selected set of 1000 sentence pairs that we checked by hand. We show that even without the benefit of anchor points the correlation between the lengths of aligned sentences is strong enough that we should expect to achieve an accuracy of between 96% and 97%. Thus, the technique may be applicable to a wider variety of texts than we have yet tried."

Considerable research has addressed the transportability of natural language systems, but not generic text processing capabilities. For example, previous DARPA-sponsored work [1, 2] produced transportable interfaces to database systems. Each new application of these interfaces generally required modifications to lexicons, new semantic knowledge bases, and other specialized features. The most that natural language text processing systems have accomplished has been the parsing of arbitrary text, without any real semantic analysis."

The objective is to develop facilities for working with large document collections that provide more refined access to the information contained in these \"source\" materials than is possible through current information retrieval procedures. The tools being used for this purpose are machine-readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and related \"resources\" that provide geographical, biographical, and other kinds of specialized knowledge. A major feature of the research program is the exploitation of the reciprocal relationships between sources and resources. These interactions between texts and tools are intended to support experts who organize and use information in a workstation environment. Two systems under development will be described to illustrate the approach: one providing capabilities for full-text subject assessment; the other for concept elaboration while reading text. Progress in the research depends critically on developments in artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and information science to provide a scientific base, and on software engineering, database management, and distributed systems to provide the technology."

In acquiring it we have to depend entirely on intersubjectively available cues as to what to say and when.\" As Patricia Smith Churchland notes in her foreword to this new edition, with Word and Object Quine challenged the tradition of conceptual analysis as a way of advancing knowledge. The book signaled twentieth-century philosophy's turn away from metaphysics and what Churchland calls the \"phony precision\" of conceptual analysis. In the course of his discussion of meaning and the linguistic mechanisms of objective reference, Quine considers the indeterminacy of translation, brings to light the anomalies and conflicts implicit in our language's referential apparatus, clarifies semantic problems connected with the imputation of existence, and marshals reasons for admitting or repudiating each of various categories of supposed objects. In addition to Churchland's foreword, this edition offers a new preface by Quine's student and colleague Dagfinn Follesdal that describes the never-realized plans for a second edition of Word and Object, in which Quine would offer a more unified treatment of the public nature of meaning, modalities, and propositional attitudes."
