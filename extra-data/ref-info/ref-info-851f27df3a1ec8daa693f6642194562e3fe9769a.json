It is likely that programming by natural language will be a key method enabling computer language-naive users to instruct their robots. This paper describes initial steps and considerations towards the design of Instruction-Based Learning (IBL) systems. The proposed methodology is to be tested in the restricted domain of route instructions with real speech input and a real mobile robot using vision for navigation. Users will use unconstrained speech within a restricted domain-specific lexicon determined by analysing a corpus of route instructions. This will maximise speech recognition performance. The robot will possess an appropriate set of primitive procedures that correspond to procedures found in route instructions. Based on 96 route instructions, it is found that the task vocabulary contains approximately 270 words, but is not closed. It increases at an average rate of one new word for every new route instruction, although there are large inter-individual differences. It is also found that 58% of instructions contain no out-of-vocabulary words. The functional vocabulary is found to include 12 different procedures, and is also not closed. It increases at an average rate of one new procedure for every 25 instructions."

In this paper, the work on robot spatial relationships is combined with a multimodal robot interface. We show how linguistic spatial descriptions and other spatial information can be extracted from an evidence grid map and how this information can be used in a natural, human-robot dialog. Examples using spatial language are included for both robot-to-human feedback and also human-to-robot commands. We also discuss some linguistic consequences in the semantic representations of spatial and locative information based on this work."

In the example of route instructions treated in this paper, the 15 primitives found include functions such as turn(), cross(), landmark_is_located(), etc. These are natural primitives of human behaviour but complex robot functions, some of which are not normally thought of by roboticists. Primitives must cope robustly with a variety of environmental conditions and require autonomous navigation capabilities based for instance on visual landmark recognition and localisation, navigable space mapping and path planning. Thus, the requirement of human-robot interaction creates specific and demanding functional targets for robot designers. A major obstacle to human-robot communication lies probably in current robots\u2019 perception capabilities. Furthermore, for human-robot communication to match the performance of human-human communication, the robot must also be provided with capabilities of re-interpreting and correcting instructions at execution time. Such a large autonomy raises wider issues of safety and control."

The current paper investigates how people give route instructions about indoor environments they have learned through navigation. We present a computational model of route instruction following called Marco and investigate the following three questions: 1. How do quality and style vary in route instructions? 2. How well does Marco follow route instructions and how closely does the model\u2019s behavior correlate with human behavior? 3. Can Marco differentiate good versus bad instruc- tions, by both human performance and ratings? Humans possess the remarkable ability to give and follow natural language route instructions through large- scale spaces. In this process, a director describes the actions and observations along the route, recalling the environment\u2019s topology, metrical layout, and visual features. A follower interprets these descriptions, navigating by applying the instructions to the possibly unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, followers must account for mistakes, ambiguities, and omissions in the route description. To study how instructions are written and followed, we collected 756 free-form route instructions from six participants for 126 routes in three virtual environments. A second group of participants and a computational model (Marco) followed these instructions. Humans successfully reached the destina- tion on 68% of the instructions and Marco followed 61% of the instructions. Marco\u2019s performance was a strong predictor of human performance and ratings of individual instructions. Why are some route instructions reliable? Keywords Artificial Intelligence; Spatial Cognition; Natural Language Understanding; Cognitive architec- tures; Human experimentation; Symbolic computational modeling Knowledge representation Introduction Imagine while walking across a campus, a stranger approaches you to ask how to get to another location. The destination is not within sight, so you cannot simply point at the goal. Instead, you must reference your memory of routes between you and the goal. Once a route is selected, you need to access your knowledge of specific landmarks and distances to provide references for the follower . You translate this knowledge into a verbal description of the route. Remarkably, a short verbal description is often sufficient to guide a follower through an unfamiliar large-scale space. Despite directors\u2019 best efforts, not all instructions are perfectly clear and reliable for reaching the goal. Often instructions contain ambiguous information (e.g. which tree is \u201cthe oak tree\u201d), qualitative mistakes within the instruction (e.g. \u201cturn right\u201d where no right turn is possible) or metrical mistakes (e.g. \u201cgo forward 3 blocks\u201d when the distance is 4 blocks). Because of these failings, the follower must treat the instructions as guidance, not as strict commands. With all the potential for miscommunication arising from the complexity of giving and understanding route instructions, the human ability to provide instructions Though a large literature examines route instructions, there is no consensus about what differentiates good instructions from bad. Vanetti and Allen (1988) found spatial ability had a larger effect in the accuracy of sub- jects\u2019 described routes than verbal ability. Daniel et al. (2003) found \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, and \u201cskeletal\u201d instructions were differentiated by whether the proper action was associated with the proper landmark. Allen (2000) suggests descriptives clauses and action delimiters should be inserted at choice points and near the destination, instead of en-route. Lovelace et al. (1999) found good route instructions mentioned many landmarks along the paths, off the route, and at the choice points. Some of these studies rate route instructions sub- jectively (Vanetti and Allen, 1988; Lovelace et al., 1999; Tversky and Lee, 1999), but do not test if navigation success is affected. Others have participants follow a small number of participant- and experimenter-written instructions (Daniel et al., 2003; Allen, 2000). Our work implements a study suggested by Lovelace et al. (1999), where participants follow route instructions from different routes and directors in virtual reality. Computational models of route instructions Software systems that analyze or follow route in- structions can be distinguished by how they represent space. Freundschuh and Egenhofer (1997) survey a variety of spatial representation models and define broad categories based on (1) if the objects in the space are manipulable, (2) if the space requires locomotion to experience, and (3) the size, or scale, of the space. This work focuses on non-manipulable, large- scale spaces that cannot be experienced from any one"

The stress in this work has been on how spatial information is best represented and how reasoning is performed with the assumed representation. In this paper I would like to address the natural language processing of texts giving directions and make a claim that during a casual first reading, there actually does not need to be much spatial reasoning going on at all. When I read a written set of directions, I am primarily interested whether the directions seem clear and sensible+not in constructing a map or program specifying all the turns, distances, and locales that will be involved. Certainly there are times when I have to make some kind of route or map structure, such as when I am the subject in a spatial reasoning experiment, or when I am lost and ask someone on the street for directions. But I do not need to work so hard when I am given a piece of paper with a set of directions, and I know that I will have this piece of paper with me when I actually make the trip. I know that I can always read the directions again to figure out what to do, when I actually set out on the trip."

A \"good\" description and a \"poor\" one were selected, based on ratings provided by judges in terms of their value for navigational assistance. People unfamiliar with the campus were then required to navigate to the target after studying one of these descriptions. In addition, a \"skeletal\" description, which contained the essentials needed for navigating, was constructed and used in the experiment. During navigation, we measured the frequencies of stops and of directional errors (whether these errors were self-corrected or corrected by the experimenter). Overall, the good and the skeletal descriptions resulted in better performance than the poor one. Their value as navigational aids was confirmed by measuring the navigation times. Analyzing the structure and content of the descriptions confirmed that the effectiveness of route directions depends on their ability to connect actions to landmarks, that is, to closely link the prescriptive and the descriptive parts of this specific type of spatial discourse."

The current study examines several methods for assessing the quality of verbal route directions by characterizing them in terms of the number of elements (such as landmarks, segments or turns) and by subjective ratings of their goodness. Route directions for routes which were both familiar and unfamiliar to the participant were studied. Subjective ratings of the quality of route directions were reliable and consistent across individuals. More complete route directions were rated as being of higher quality. For all routes, inclusion of more segment and turn mentions were correlated with higher quality route directions. Good route descriptions for familiar versus unfamiliar routes differed in terms of the types of landmarks included."

The corpus uses the Map Task (Brown, Anderson, Yule, and Shillcock, 1983) in which speakers must collaborate verbally to reproduce on one participant's map a route printed on the other's. In all, the corpus includes four conversations from each of 64 young adults and manipulates the following variables: familiarity of speakers, eye contact between speakers, matching between landmarks on the participants' maps, opportunities for contrastive stress, and phonological characteristics of landmark names. The motivations for the design are set out and basic corpus statistics are presented."

Initially, subjects were selected for inclusion in four groups based on their combination of spatial and verbal abilities. Subsequently, the performance of high spatial-high verbal, high spatial-low verbal, low spatial-high verbal, and low spatial-low verbal subjects was measured on tasks requiring the comprehension and production of route directions. No differences were found with regard to subjects' abilities to comprehend route directions. However, the results suggested that spatial abilities are very important in the production of efficient route directions and that verbal abilities are related to subjects' tendency to conform to certain proposed linguistic conventions regarding the communication of route knowledge."

We present a hybrid extension to the spatial semantic hierarchy that combines their strengths and avoids their weaknesses. Metrical SLAM methods are used to build local maps of small-scale space within the sensory horizon of the agent, while topological methods are used to represent the structure of large-scale space. We describe how a local perceptual map is analyzed to identify a local topology description and is abstracted to a topological place. The map building method creates a set of topological map hypotheses that are consistent with travel experience. The set of maps is guaranteed under reasonable assumptions to include the correct map. We demonstrate the method on a real environment with multiple nested large-scale loops."
