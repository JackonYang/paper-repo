                "text": "In the QBIC (Query By Image Content) project we are studying methods to query large on-line image databases using the images' content as the basis of the queries. Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (\\Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one\"), photo-journalism (\\Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom\"), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. We describe a set of novel features and similarity measures allowing query by color, texture, and shape of image object. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the QBIC system with normalized precision and recall experiments on test databases containing over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images, and of images of airplane silhouettes. We also consider the e cient indexing of these features, speci cally addressing two problems: (a) for our feature vectors, the desired distance function is not Euclidean, and/or (b) the vectors have high dimensionality. We propose novel, general solutions to both problems by allowing some \\false alarms\" (\\false hits\", or \\false positives\") but no false dismissals. For the rst problem, we introduce a new theorem that makes indexing possible by bounding the non-Euclidean, full cross-term quadratic distance expression with a simple Euclidean distance. For the second, we illustrate how orthogonal transforms, such as the Karhunen Loeve transform, can help reduce the dimensionality, without introducing false dismissals. The resulting QBIC system o ers high quality of output, and signi cant speedup over straightforward indexing alternatives. The system is implemented in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000.

The search can be focused on either image objects (areas previously outlined by the user) or on the whole images. The search argument can be all or part of a particular image, or user-selected patterns of color, texture, or shape selected from 'pickers', or any weighted combination of these patterns. An example of a search by shape and color, and associated result is given. The results of initial experimentation are encouraging.<<ETX>>"

The object-oriented paradigm has been and continues to be a great impetus to this work. The semantics of images is essentially what they contain, and unless there is an effective method to identify their contents and index them on that basis, the database will degenerate to a collection of patterns with no semantics. This is the most challenging issue facing multimedia information systems in general, and image databases in particular. Work on query by image content has barely begun to scratch the surface. A few key query primitives will become well-understood and widely supported. To allow users to browse and search through information domains using sophisticated querying techniques that include imprecise queries, user-directed query processing, and queries that use similarity measures in order to retrieve data, new data modeling approaches are required. Key problems that arise in providing query by image content are considered.<<ETX>>"

How, then, can it be possible to build a tool for indexing into a large database of, say, thousands of images, which works effectively in `interactive time' on affordable hardware? One important optimization is to take advantage of interaction with the user to find out what types of variation are expected in the database, and to rely on the user to discriminate between similar-looking objects. Another is to create appropriate data structures off-line to speed on-line searches. We are building a tool, called FINDIT, for locating the image of an object from within a large number of images of scenes which may contain the object. The user outlines an object in an image that he wants to find in the database, and specifies the constraints on the transformations of the object that are expected to occur. The program acts as a filter to quickly reduce the possible number of candidates to a number small enough to be perused by the user. FINDIT chooses an appropriate search algorithm depending on the selection of constraints by the user."

The authors are building an image database in which images are indexed by both the numerical index keys generated automatically from the captured primitive image features using a set of rules, and traditional descriptive keywords entered by users when images are loaded. Users can either use the descriptive keywords or provide information regarding these image properties to query and retrieve images from the database. With this approach, the authors turn the difficult problem of image matching into image retrieval by index keys, which can be performed easily and rapidly using current database techniques. Initial experiments on the image database system show promising performance.<<ETX>>"

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

The former includes a sketch retrieval function and a similarity retrieval function, while the latter includes a sense retrieval function. We adopt both an image model and a user model to interpret and operate the contents of image data from the user''s viewpoint. The image model describes the graphical features of image data, while the user model reflects the visual perception processes of the user. These models, automatically created by image analysis and statistical learning, are referred to as abstract indexes stored in relational tables. These algorithms are developed on our experimental database system, the TRADEMARK and the ART MUSEUM."

Furthermore, a few attributes of a node/branch help to express numerical shape features of regions. Similarity retrieval thereby turns out to be equivalent to graph matching. The similarity retrieval process of the system is as follows: (1) select a visual example image as a query and generate its graph structure, (2) calculate an optimal graph matching cost between a query graph and an archived graph in the database, utilizing algorithm A* with heuristic information, (3) choose archived images in the ascending order of a corresponding matching cost."

The approach is based on the differential quantization of images, in which smooth approximations are subtracted from the image prior to quantization. They consider two such approximations. The first one is an approximation by splines obtained from a sparse and fixed subsampled array of the image. The second one segments the image into piecewise constant regions on the basis of the local activity of the image. Both these approximations result in remainders of residual images where large errors are localized in portions of the image of high activity. Because of visual masking the remainder image can now be coarsely quantized without visual impairment to the reconstructed image. The coarsely quantized remainder is now encoded in an error free manner. In such a perceptually based encoding method the mean square error is now dependent on the activity of the image.<<ETX>>"

The images contain a high degree of visual noise and currently must be interpreted by human experts. We are studying the classification problem in the context of intelligent image databases. Here we present a technique for automatic identification of microfossil structures and for classification of the structures according to which type of 3-D section they represent. This is achieved by using: (1) A specialized filter to detect local curves in the gray level image data; and (2) Hough transform processing of the resulting feature point vectors. An interesting aspect of our approach is that the processing of the features is not embedded in a program but is instead specified using a visual query language. This allows us to experiment quickly with different types of grouping criteria. The detection performance of our system is comparable with that of a trained geologist. We store the information obtained in a database together with the raw image data. The system can then present the user with only those images which contain structures of interest."

This theory precisely relates (a) the rate of decay in the error between the original image and the compressed image as the size of the compressed image representation increases (i.e., as the amount of compression decreases) to (b) the smoothness of the image in certain smoothness classes called Besov spaces. Within this theory, the error incurred by the quantization of wavelet transform coefficients is explained. Several compression algorithms based on piecewise constant approximations are analyzed in some detail. It is shown that, if pictures can be characterized by their membership in the smoothness classes considered, then wavelet-based methods are near-optimal within a larger class of stable transform-based, nonlinear methods of image compression. Based on previous experimental research it is argued that in most instances the error incurred in image compression should be measured in the integral sense instead of the mean-square sense. >"

Since the ultimate criterion of quality is that judged or measured by the human receiver, it is important that the compression (or coding) algorithm minimizes perceptually meaningful measures of signal distortion, rather than more traditional and tractable criteria such as the mean squared difference between the waveform at the input and output of the coding system. This paper develops the notion of perceptual coding based on the concept of distortion-masking by the signal being compressed, and describes how the field has progressed as a result of advances in classical coding theory, modelling of human vision, and digital signal processing. We propose that fundamental limits in the science can be expressed by the semi-quantitative concepts of perceptual entropy and the perceptual distortion-rate function, and we examine current compression technology with respect to that framework. We conclude with a summary of future challenges and research directions."

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated. >"

In contrast, the methods presented here are based on the recently developed theory of wavelets and are applicable to all Calderon-Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators. The algorithms of this paper require order O(N) or O(N log N) operations to apply an N \u00d7 N matrix to a vector (depending on the particular operator and the version of the algorithm being used), and our numerical experiments indicate that many previously intractable problems become manageable with the techniques presented here."

Since we started this work at Xerox PARC in 1988, a number of researchers around the world have begun to work in the ubiquitous computing framework. This paper explains what is new and different about the computer science in ubiquitous computing. It starts with a brief overview of ubiquitous computing, and then elaborates through a series of examples drawn from various subdisciplines of computer science: hardware components (e.g. chips), network protocols, interaction substrates (e.g. software for screens and pens), applications, privacy, and computational methods. Ubiquitous computing offers a framework for new and exciting research across the spectrum of computer science."
