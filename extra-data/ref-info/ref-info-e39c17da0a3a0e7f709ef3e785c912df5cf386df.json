                "text": "A form of catatonic schizophrenia in which the symptoms vary with remarkably regular periodicity has been studied at length by Gjessing.l2,la He was able to establish a correlation between rhythmic changes in the basal metabolism rate and the periodic variation in these symptoms. For further references to Gjessing's work and a bibliography of similar observations made by others, see Rashevsky.17 These results led Danziger and Elmergreen5-* to the idea that the rhythmicity of periodic catatonic schizophrenia may be due to a sustained periodicity in the endocrine system. They set up a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations to describe the concentration levels of thyroid, thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone), and a hypothesized enzyme. Their mathematical analysis of this system showed that either the levels of thyroid, thyrotropin, and enzyme attain essentially constant values or the thyroid level oscillates (not, in general, periodically). The purpose of this paper is to make a more extensive mathematical analysis of the Danziger-Elmergreen equations and to draw some medical conclusions from this analysis. The mathematical analysis is carried out with use of standard methods and also with use of a recent theorem stating that under certain stability conditions there exists a periodic solution of the system of differential equations. The mathematical analysis suggests the following medical conclusions. First, symptoms of catatonic schizophrenia, whether periodic or aperiodic, are associated with certain levels of concentration of thyroid, thyrotropin, and enzyme. Second, if the levels of concentration are governed by the Danziger-Elmergreen equations, then: 1) they remain essentially constant; or 2) they vary periodically; or 3) they vary in a bounded but otherwise somewhat random manner. These three possibilities correspond to various mathematical conditions holding on the equations, conditions which will be described in detail later. The first alternative would correspond t o an absence of schizophrenic symptoms or the presence of constant or stabilized symptoms. The second alternative would correspond to the presence of periodic catatonic schizophrenia. The third would correspond to catatonic schizophrenia in which the symptoms varied in seemingly random manner. (Such variance is often medically observed.) (See Reference 11, p. 622.) Finally, analysis of the equations indicates that if thyroid is administered to a schizophrenic patient, the levels of concentration of thyroid, thyrotropin, and enzyme become essentially constant, so that there would be an absence of schizophrenic symptoms or the presence of constant or stabilized symptoms. This conclusion agrees with medical observations. (See Richter,lg p. 91 .) The Danziger-Elmergreen system is probably a crude model. Danziger and Elmergreen8 have proposed a refinement of the system, and several refinements and"

The duration of each cycle of Cheyne-Stokes breathing increased proportionately with the volume of the delay system and decreased as the perfusion pressure to the brain was increased. Periodic variations in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood were found to be in appropriate phase to stimulate the respiratory centers at the time of maximal ventilation. This supports the theory that Cheyne-Stokes breathing is due to oscillation of the respiratory control system."

The observation of cyclical granulopoiesis in chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) suggests that control is deranged rather than abolished in this disorder. Analysis of the kinetics of granulopoiesis in CGL may provide some insight into the nature of the derangement. To facilitate analysis, a mathematical model of the granulopoietic control system is proposed and examined using computer simulation. With model parameters initially chosen to represent normal granulopoiesis, the minimal changes necessary to represent granulopoiesis in CGL were investigated. This analysis indicates that two separate changes seem to be required: (1) the granulocyte maturation time must be increased and (2) the precursor input to the granulocytic pathway of development must also be increased. A causal association between delayed maturation and rising precursor input is suggested, and some possible mechanisms of association are proposed."

The model simulates kinetic data from human DF32 P and 3H\u2010thymidine labelling experiments, and the data obtained by Morley & Stohlman in mice (1970) following destruction of four\u2010fifths of the marrow. Support for King\u2010Smith & Morley's (1970) suggestion that cyclic neutropenia may be a stem cell defect is forthcoming, but only after the addition of a further negative feedback loop simulating a granulocyte\u2018chalone\u2019 or a considerable reduction in the time required for precursor cell division. The value of the model in the interpretation and design of kinetic studies, particularly in the non\u2010steady state, is discussed."

In each patient the length of the cycle was the same for granulocytes and platelets although the phases differed; the cycle was 66 days in one and 56 days in the other. In both the amplitude of each consecutive granulocyte oscillation increased, whereas the nadir remained about the same. The platelet cycles followed the same pattern of increasing amplitude. Using 32P-di-isopropylfluorophosphate during different periods of the cycle, we showed changes in the total blood granulocyte pool with no shift to the marginal pool to account for the fluctuations in white-cell counts. A negative feedback mechanism under the control of some circulating substance that diminishes with time seems the most likely explanation of these data."

To investigate the mechanism of cyclic neutropenia four patients were studied with daily complete blood counts, serial bone marrow examinations, marrow reserve testing, serum muramidase determinations, DF(22)P granulocytokinetic studies, and, in one patient, in vivo [(3)H]TdR labeling. Periodogram analysis of the serial blood counts in the latter patient and visual inspection of multiple cycles in the others revealed periodic fluctuations in the levels of blood neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, reticulocytes, and platelets. Rhythmic changes in the morphologic and radioisotopic studies as well as the marrow reserve tests and muramidase measurements were consonant with a mechanism of periodic failure of marrow production rather than peripheral destruction. Human cyclic neutropenia is analogous to cyclic neutropenia in the grey collie dog and may be viewed as the consequence of cyclic hematopoiesis."

She remained untreated for 2\u00bd yr. Colony-stimulating factor levels showed an inverse relationship to the peripheral leukocyte count. Two distinct phases in cyclic patterns of peripheral leukocyte counts prior to treatment could be appreciated in retrospect: phase 1, a stable 15-mo period during which leukocyte counts peaked every 10 wk and then returned to baseline levels, and phase 2, an 18-mo period of insidious deterioration during which the low points of successive cycles became progressively higher and leukocytes were accumulating in the peripheral blood at a rate of 400 x 106/day. We propose that the increased marrow production of myeloid cells in this disease does not represent a life-threatening situation until cell accumulation begins. We attempted, therefore, to halt or to reverse this accumulation by cell separator leukapheresis."

Using these methods, there was no significant difference between CSF levels of neutropenic and normal subjects. These data indicate that CSF levels are not inversely related to the blood neutrophil count in chronic idiopathic neutropenia and suggest that CSF is not a hormone regulating the blood neutrophil count in a manner analogous to the erythropoietin regulation of circulating erythrocyte levels."

Urinary CSF output was determined using mouse marrow target cells, and serum CSF activity was assayed with human marrow target cells by the double agar layer technique. Using these methods, there was no significant difference between CSF levels of neutropenic and normal subjects. These data indicate that CSF levels are not inversely related to the blood neutrophil count in chronic idiopathic neutropenia and suggest that CSF is not a hormone regulating the blood neutrophil count in a manner analogous to the erythropoietin regulation of circulating erythrocyte levels."

The cycle interval was 53--69 days. Except for reticulocytes all other cells cycled with neutrophils. Plasma colony-stimulating factor (CSF) oscillated out of phase with neutrophils, suggesting that granulocytopoiesis is regulated through CSF by a feed-back mechanism. Plasma erythropoiesis-stimulating factor (ESF) also oscillated. ESF crests preceded or coincided with reticulocyte crests, indicating that the ESF elevation may have been responsible for the reticulocyte peaks. The relationship between neutrophils and reticulocytes and their oscillations with plasma CSF and ESF suggests that there is a common stem cell which differentiates along one cell line or the other depending upon the balance of regulatory stimuli. The fraction of blood neutrophilic precursors (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes) in DNA synthesis fluctuated with neutrophil level. The calculated generation time was shorter at the crests than at the troughs of the neutrophil cycles. This finding suggested that the rate of proliferation of the neutrophils changed periodically. This observation, along with a periodic increase in differentiation of the stem cell toward the neutrophilic cells, is the probable explanation of oscillation of the neutrophil count in the blood."
