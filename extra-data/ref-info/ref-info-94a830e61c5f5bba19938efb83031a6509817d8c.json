These relationships, also called their taxonomy, allow categories to be defined recursively, as spatial configurations of (simpler) subcategories each of which may be shared by many categories. Each image is represented by a segmentation tree, whose structure captures recursive embedding of image regions in a multiscale segmentation, and whose nodes contain the associated region properties. The presence of any occurring categories is reflected in the occurrence of associated, similar subtrees within the image trees. Similar subtrees across the entire image set are clustered. Each cluster corresponds to a discovered category, represented by the cluster properties. A (subcategory) cluster of small matching subtrees may occur within multiple clusters (categories) of larger matching subtrees, in different spatial relationships with subtrees from other small clusters. Such recursive embedding, grouping and intersection of clusters is captured in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) which represents the discovered taxonomy. Detection, recognition and segmentation of any of the learned categories present in a new image are simultaneously conducted by matching the segmentation tree of the new image with the learned DAG. This matching also yields a semantic explanation of the recognized category, in terms of the presence of its subcategories. Experiments with a newly compiled dataset of four-legged animals demonstrate good cross-category resolvability."

This paper is aimed at simultaneously solving the following related problems: (1) unsupervised identification of photometric, geometric, and topological (mutual containment) properties of multiscale regions defining objects in the category; (2) learning a region-based structural model of the category in terms of these properties from a set of training images; and (3) segmentation and recognition of objects from the category in new images. To this end, each image is represented by a tree that captures a multiscale image segmentation. The trees are matched to find the maximally matching subtrees across the set, the existence of which is itself viewed as evidence that a category is indeed present. The matched subtrees are fused into a canonical tree, which represents the learned model of the category. Recognition of objects in a new image and image segmentation delineating all object parts are achieved simultaneously by finding matches of the model with subtrees of the new image. Experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed approach has similar recognition and superior localization performance while it uses fewer training examples."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

We use patch-based feature vectors common in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions. Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions\u00bfa different parameterized function for every image of our training set\u00bfwhereas typically a single global distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome, Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered. We train and test using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark."

The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The results demonstrate the superiority of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality, using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning."

                "text": "RELIEF is considered one of the most successful algorithms for assessing the quality of features. In this paper, we propose a set of new feature weighting algorithms that perform significantly better than RELIEF, without introducing a large increase in computational complexity. Our work starts from a mathematical interpretation of the seemingly heuristic RELIEF algorithm as an online method solving a convex optimization problem with a margin-based objective function. This interpretation explains the success of RELIEF in real application and enables us to identify and address its following weaknesses. RELIEF makes an implicit assumption that the nearest neighbors found in the original feature space are the ones in the weighted space and RELIEF lacks a mechanism to deal with outlier data. We propose an iterative RELIEF (I-RELIEF) algorithm to alleviate the deficiencies of RELIEF by exploring the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm. We extend I-RELIEF to multiclass settings by using a new multiclass margin definition. To reduce computational costs, an online learning algorithm is also developed. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented. The results of large-scale experiments on the UCI and microarray data sets are reported, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and verify the presented theoretical results"
