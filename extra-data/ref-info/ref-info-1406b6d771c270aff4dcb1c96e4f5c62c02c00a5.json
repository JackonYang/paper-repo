My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

In ? 4 modifications of the model are examined which have the effect of removing singularities of r(s) at s = 0. In ? 5 I consider the three-dimensional model in a slab of finite or semi-infinite thickness, with varying boundary conditions, and with drift perpendicular to the face of the slab. In this way I find the various covariance functions (25), (26), (28), (29), (30), (39) and (40)."
