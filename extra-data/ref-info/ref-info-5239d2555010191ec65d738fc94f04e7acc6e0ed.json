The key idea here is that a geometric class defined in 3D induces relationships in the image which must hold between points on the image outline (the perspective projection of the object). The resulting image constraints enable both identification and grouping of image features belonging to objects of that class. The classes include surfaces of revolution, canal surfaces (pipes) and polyhedra. Recognition proceeds by first recognising an object as belonging to one of the classes (for example a surface of revolution) and subsequently identifying the object (for example as a particular vase). This differs from conventional object recognition systems where recognition is generally targetted at particular objects. These classes also support the computation of 3D invariant descriptions including symmetry axes, canonical coordinate frames and projective signatures. The constraints and grouping methods are viewpoint invariant, and proceed with no information on object pose. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this class-based grouping on real, cluttered scenes using grouping algorithms developed for rotationally symmetric surfaces, canal-surfaces and polyhedra.<<ETX>>"

The approach combines color and texture properties to obtain an effective mask for skin regions. The skin mask is shown to be effective for a wide range of shades and colors of skin. These skin regions are then fed to a specialized grouper, which attempts to group a human figure using geometric constraints on human structure. This approach introduces a new view of object recognition, where an object model is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts, and the relationships between parts, and constraints on color and texture. The system is demonstrated to have 60% precision and 52% recall on a test set of 138 uncontrolled images of naked people, mostly obtained from the internet, and 1401 assorted control images, drawn from a wide collection of sources."

To avoid the expense and limitations of text, there is considerable interest in navigation by perceptual and other automatically extractable attributes. Unfortunately, the relevance of an attribute for a query is not always obvious. Queries which go beyond explicit color, shape, and positional cues must incorporate multiple features in complex ways. This dissertation uses machine learning to automatically select and combine features to satisfy a query, based on positive and negative examples from the user. The learning algorithm does not just learn during the course of one session: it learns continuously, across sessions. The learner improves its learning ability by dynamically modifying its inductive bias, based on experience over multiple sessions. Experiments demonstrate the ability to assist image classiication, segmentation, and annotation (labeling of image regions). The common theme of this work, applied to computer vision, database retrieval, and machine learning, is building in enough exibility to allow adaptation to changing goals."

The query image may be a hand-drawn sketch or a (potentially low-quality) scan of the image to be retrieved. Our searching algorithm makes use of multiresolution wavelet decompositions of the query and database images. The coefficients of these decompositions are distilled into small \u201csignatures\u201d for each image. We introduce an \u201cimage querying metric\u201d that operates on these signatures. This metric essentially compares how many significant wavelet coefficients the query has in common with potential targets. The metric includes parameters that can be tuned, using a statistical analysis, to accommodate the kinds of image distortions found in different types of image queries. The resulting algorithm is simple, requires very little storage overhead for the database of signatures, and is fast enough to be performed on a database of 20,000 images at interactive rates (on standard desktop machines) as a query is sketched. Our experiments with hundreds of queries in databases of 1000 and 20,000 images show dramatic improvement, in both speed and success rate, over using a conventional L1, L2, or color histogram norm.

Consequently, we must either develop viewer centered representations or have methods for directly relating viewpoint dependent features to 3D models. Aspect graphs, which enumerate all topologically distinct line drawings, may be too weak by themselves to support recognition. However, they can be used to control the search for image-model correspondences when coupled with the constraints afforded by viewpoint dependent features. When objects are represented by algebraic surfaces, these constraints can be expressed as systems of polynomial equations which can be solved using well established techniques. Alternatively, a new representation has been proposed called HOT Curves. Like representations based on geometric invariance, HOT Curves encode the relationship of image features for a particular 3D object. The representation can be constructed directly from a set of images, the features are viewpoint dependent, and indexing schemes are supported."

Since there are infinitely many points of view, one is faced with the problem of a search in a multidimensional parameter space. A related problem is the stereo reconstruction of 3-D surfaces from multiple 2-d images. The author proposes to solve these fundamental problems by using geometrical properties of the visible shape that are invariant to a change in the point of view. To obtain such invariants, he starts from classical theories for differential and algebraic invariants not previously used in image understanding. As they stand, these theories are not directly applicable to vision. He suggests extensions and adaptations of these methods to the needs of machine vision. He then studies general projective transformations, which include both perspective and orthographic projections as special cases.<<ETX>>"

New tools are needed to help users create, manage, and retrieve images from these collections. We are developing QBIC (query by image content), a prototype system that allows a user to create and query image databases in which the image content -- the colors, textures, shapes, and layout of images and the objects they contain -- is used as the basis of queries. This paper describes two sets of algorithms in QBIC. The first are methods that allow `query by color drawing,' a form of query in which a user draws an approximate color version of an image, and similar images are retrieved. These are automatic algorithms in the sense that no user action is necessary during database population. Secondly, we describe algorithms for semi-automatic identification of image objects during database population, improving the speed and usability of this manually-intensive step. Once outlined, detailed queries on the content-properties of these individual objects can be made at query time."

For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations.

These are represented by splashes and 3-D curves, respectively. It is shown how both of these primitives can be encoded by a set of super segments, consisting of connected linear segments. These super segments are entered into a table and provide the essential mechanism for fast retrieval and matching. The issues of robustness and stability of the features are addressed in detail. The acquisition of the 3-D models is performed automatically by computing splashes in highly structured areas of the objects and by using boundary and surface edges for the generation of 3-D curves.

The processing of each image consists of a feature extraction stage and a grouping stage. The ensuing concept-recognition is accomplished using a decision tree. The pixel-level features consist of basic color and texture information. The color information consists of hue, saturation and value (intensity) data and the texture information is obtained using the windowed-image second moment matrix. The pixel-level features are quantized into one of a dozen or so bins based on an empirically determined perceptual partitioning of color/texture space. The set of binary images associated with this quantization step are each grouped in parallel according to three diierent strategies. The three grouping strategies seek to form regions according to (1) solid contiguity, (2) similarity in local orientation and (3) similarity in diiuseness. As an example, one of the above mentioned binary images contains a 1 at each point where the original image contains a pixel with a bluish hue. Should the input image contain clear blue sky above the horizon, the rst grouping strategy would produce a large connected region in the binary image representing the pixels with a light-blue color. The second grouping strategy would abort due to lack of orientation strength and the third strategy would fail since the sky-blob is not diiuse. Each blob is represented by a feature vector containing its area, coordinates in the image, eccentricity , principle orientation, mean saturation and mean intensity, as well as by the color/texture bin and grouping strategy which gave rise to it. These feature vectors are the input to the decision tree classiier. The decision tree attempts to assign a label to each blob according to these characteristics."

Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

The goal was to integrate a relational database retrieval system with content analysis techniques that would give our querying system a better method for handling images. Our simple color analysis method, if used in conjunction with other search criteria, improves our ability to retrieve images efficiently. The best result is obtained when text-based search criteria are combined with content-based criteria and when a coarse granularity is used for content analysis. >"

Indexing and searching images need not require solving the image understanding problem. Instead, the general approach should be to provide an arsenal of image decompositions and discriminants that can be precomputed for images. At search time, users can select a weighted subset of these decompositions to be used for computing image similarity measurements. While this approach avoids the search-time-dependent problem of labeling what is important in images, it still holds several important problems that require further research in the area of query by image content. We briefly explore some of these problems as they pertain to shape."

The authors' approach is based on the analysis of the projective properties of a small number of generalized cylinder primitives and their relationships in the image which make up common man-made objects. Past work on this problem has either assumed perfect contours as input or used 2-dimensional shape primitives without relating them to 3-D shape. The method the authors present explicitly uses the 3-dimensionality of the desired descriptions and directly addresses the segmentation problem in the presence of contour breaks, markings shadows and occlusion. This work has many significant applications including recognition of complex curved objects from a single real intensity image. The authors demonstrate their method on real images."

The grouping is represented by a graph where nodes correspond to individual elements and arcs join spatially neighboring elements. Associated with each arc is an affine map that best transforms the image patch at one location to the other. The approach we propose consists of 4 steps: (1) detecting \u201cinteresting\u201d elements in the image; (2) matching elements with their neighbors and estimating the affine transform between them; (3) growing the element to form a more distinctive unit; and (4) grouping the elements. The idea is analogous to tracking in dynamic imagery.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

                "text": "Toward the development of an object recognition and positioning system, able to deal with arbitrary shaped objects in cluttered environments, we introduce methods for checking the match of two arbitrary curves in 2D or surfaces in 3D, when each of these subobjects (i.e., regions) is in arbitrary position, and we also show how to efficiently compute explicit expressions for the coordinate transformation which makes two matching subobjects (i.e., regions) coincide. This is to be used for comparing an arbitrarily positioned subobject of sensed data with objects in a data base, where each stored object is described in some \u201cstandard\u201d position. In both cases, matching and positioning, results are invariant with respect to viewer coordinate system, i.e., invariant to the arbitrary location and orientation of the object in the data set, or, more generally, to affine transformations of the objects in the data set, which means translation, rotation, and different stretchings in two (or three) directions, and these techniques apply to both 2D and 3D problems. The 3D Euclidean case is useful for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from range data, and the 2D affine case for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from projections, e.g., from curves in a single image, and in motion estimation. The matching of arbitrarily shaped regions is done by computing for each region a vector of centered moments. These vectors are viewpointdependent, but the dependence on the viewpoint is algebraic and well known. We then compute moment invariants, i.e., algebraic functions of the moments that are invariant to Euclidean or affine transformations of the data set. We present a new family of computationally efficient algorithms, based on matrix computations, for the evaluation of both Euclidean and affine algebraic moment invariants of data sets. The use of moment invariants greatly reduces the computation required for the matching, and hence initial object recognition. The approach to determining and computing these moment invariants is different than those used by the vision community previously. The method for computing the coordinate transformation which makes the two matching regions coincide provides an estimate of object position. The estimation of the matching transformation is based on the same matrix computation techniques introduced for the computation of invariants, it involves simple manipulations of the moment vectors, it neither requires costly iterative methods, nor going back to the data set. The use of geometric invariants in this application is equivalent to specifying a center and an orientation for an arbitrary data constellation in a region. These geometric invariant methods appear to be very important for dealing with the situation of a large number of different possible objects in the presence of occlusion and clutter. As we point out in this paper, each moment invariant also defines an algebraic invariant, i.e., an invariant algebraic function of the coefficients of the best fitting polynomial to the data. Hence, this paper also introduces a new design and computation approach to algebraic invariants."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images."

This paper represents a first attempt to apply and optimise relevance feedback techniques to improve retrieval in a text-based image archival system. The design exploits the rapid assessment possible with image data to facilitate query refinement and collect large amounts of relevance feedback data This data can then be used to extend incomplete image descriptions, thus ameliorat ing problems associated with text annotation of images. Visu ally oriented relevance feedback and query modification is implemented using direct mampulation of icons. An algorithm designed for dynamic modification of image descriptions based on relevance feedback is proposed, implemented, and experi mentally tested. Initial experiments show significant improve ments and demonstrate the potential of using these tech niques for image retrieval applications."

We use the orientation histogram as a feature vector for gesture class cation and interpolation. This method is simple and fast to compute, and o ers some robustness to scene illumination changes. We have implemented a real-time version, which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 di erent hand gestures. All the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize the image. A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control, or play a game. We discuss limitations of this method. For moving or \\dynamic gestures\", the histogram of the spatio-temporal gradients of image intensity form the analogous feature vector and may be useful for dynamic gesture recognition.

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

These results are illustrated throughout with examples from images of real scenes."

We model the texture distortion for a given point and direction on the image plane as an affine transformation and derive the relationship between the parameters of this transformation and the shape parameters. We use non-linear minimization of a least squares error criterion to estimate the shape parameters from the affine transformations, using a simple linear algorithm to obtain an initial guess. Under the assumption that the measurement errors in the affine parameters are independent and normally distributed, we can find error bounds on the shape parameter estimates. We present results on images of planar and curved surfaces under perspective projection. We find all five local shape and orientation parameters with no a priori assumptions about the shape of the surface."

In the unsupervised learning stage a statistical clustering scheme is used for the quantization of the feature-vector attributes.

We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

To see only thus far is to miss the point of one of the important interconnections which Sapir saw between language, culture, and psychology, and succinctly expressed in the introductory quotation. It is not so much in these special uses of language as in its constant ways of arranging data and its most ordinary everyday analysis of phenomena that we need to recognize the influence it has on other activities, cultural and personal."

A technique to recognize these activities using the detection scheme described is proposed. It is not clear how much the periodicity alone is useful for recognition, but the authors believe that the phase information is valuable for activity recognition.<<ETX>>"

En effet, les linguistes ont tendance a expliquer certains phenomenes en se basant sur certaines entites ou certaines doctrines philosophiques, dont l'explication repose a son tour sur les phenomenes linguistiques expliques. Par exemple, les linguistes tentent parfois d'expliquer des mots tels que necessaire en se referant simplement a des mondes possibles dont ils ne s'inquietent pas de la nature reelle parce qu'elle est expliquee par les philosophes. Toutefois, les philosophes se situant apres le tournant linguistique ayant touche la pensee philosophique souhaiteraient reduire l'explication des mondes possibles a l'explication du discours sur les mondes possibles, ce qui n'est rien d'autre que le discours linguistique, ou logico-linguistique, sur les mots tels que necessaire"

A user provides an example image to the system, and images in the database that are similar to that example are retrieved. The development of CANDID was inspired by the N-gram approach to document fingerprinting, where a `global signature' is computed for every document in a database and these signatures are compared to one another to determine the similarity between any two documents. CANDID computes a global signature for every image in a database, where the signature is derived from various image features such as localized texture, shape, or color information. A distance between probability density functions of feature vectors is then used to compare signatures. In this paper, we present CANDID and highlight two results from our current research: subtracting a `background' signature from every signature in a database in an attempt to improve system performance when using inner-product similarity measures, and visualizing the contribution of individual pixels in the matching process. These ideas are applicable to any histogram-based comparison technique."
