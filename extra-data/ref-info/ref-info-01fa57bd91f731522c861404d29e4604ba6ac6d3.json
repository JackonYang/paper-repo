We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

                "text": "A COMPARISON OF TWO SMOOTHING METHODS FOR WORD BIGRAM MODELS \nLinda Bauman Peto \nDepartment of Computer Science \nUniversity of Toronto Abstract Word bigram models estimated from text corpora require smoothing methods to estimate the probabilities of unseen bigrams. The deleted estimation method uses the formula: \nPr(i|j) = lambda f_i + (1-lambda)f_i|j, where f_i and f_i|j are the relative frequency of i and the conditional relative frequency of i given j, respectively, and lambda is an optimized parameter. MacKay (1994) proposes a Bayesian approach using Dirichlet priors, which yields a different formula: \nPr(i|j) = (alpha/F_j + alpha) m_i + (1 - alpha/F_j + alpha) f_i|j where F_j is the count of j and alpha and m_i are optimized parameters. This thesis describes an experiment in which the two methods were trained on a two-million-word corpus taken from the Canadian _Hansard_ and compared on the basis of the experimental perplexity that they assigned to a shared test corpus. The methods proved to be about equally accurate, with MacKay's method using fewer resources."

The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay, discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given."

This note shows how, with respect to a flexible class of prior distributions for this parameter, the posterior may be represented in a simple conditional form that is easily simulated. As a result, inference about this key quantity may be developed in tandem with the existing, routine Gibbs sampling algorithms for fitting such mixture models. The concept of data augmentation is important, as ever, in developing this extension of the existing algorithm. A final section notes an simple asymptotic approximation to the posterior."

                "text": "Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English). One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths. The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of sentences, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this difference. This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does. An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI). In addition, in order to facilitate replication of the align program, an appendix is provided with detailed c-code of the more difficult core of the align program."

This paper outlines how a tree learning algorithm can be derived using Bayesian statistics. This introduces Bayesian techniques for splitting, smoothing, and tree averaging. The splitting rule is similar to Quinlan's information gain, while smoothing and averaging replace pruning. Comparative experiments with reimplementations of a minimum encoding approach,c4 (Quinlanet al., 1987) andcart (Breimanet al., 1984), show that the full Bayesian algorithm can produce more accurate predictions than versions of these other approaches, though pays a computational price."

The argument repeatedly goes from the particular to the general, in that if there are general theories then they must apply to special cases. Two such special cases, formalised as the \u201cCox axioms \u201c, lead to the well-known fact that Bayesian probability theory is the only consistent language of inference. Further cases, formalised as the axioms of maximum entropy, show that the prior probability distribution for any positive, additive distribution must be monotonic in the entropy. Finally, a quantified special case shows that this monotonic function must be the exponential, leaving only a single dimensional scaling factor to be determined a posteriori. Many types of distribution, including probability distributions themselves, are positive and additive, so the entropy exponential is very general."

In this paper the derivation of \u201cClassic\u201d MaxEnt is completed, showing that it leads to a natural choice for the regularising parameter \u03b1, that supersedes the traditional practice of setting x2=N. The new condition is that the dimensionless measure of structure -2\u03b1S should be equal to the number of good singular values contained in the data. The performance of this new condition is discussed with reference to image deconvolution, but leads to a reconstruction that is visually disappointing. A deeper hypothesis space is proposed that overcomes these difficulties, by allowing for spatial correlations across the image."
