The basis of the representation is a motion history image (MHI)-a static image where intensity is a function of the recency of motion in a sequence. We develop a recognition method which uses both binary and scalar valued versions of the MHI as temporal templates to match against stored instances of actions. The method automatically performs temporal segmentation, as invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real time on a standard platform. The applications we have begun to develop include simple room monitoring and an interactive game."

It is a feature-based bottom-up approach that is characterized by its learning capability and time-scale invariability. To apply HMMs, one set of time-sequential images is transformed into an image feature vector sequence, and the sequence is converted into a symbol sequence by vector quantization. In learning human action categories, the parameters of the HMMs, one per category, are optimized so as to best describe the training sequences from the category. To recognize an observed sequence, the HMM which best matches the sequence is chosen. Experimental results for real time-sequential images of sports scenes show recognition rates higher than 90%. The recognition rate is improved by increasing the number of people used to generate the training data, indicating the possibility of establishing a person-independent action recognizer.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Recognition of motion sequences is a crucial ability for biological and robot vision systems. We present an architecture for the higher-level processes involved in recognition of complex structured motion. The work is focused on modeling human recognition of Moving Light Displays. MLDs are image sequences that contain only motion information at a small number of locations. Despite the extreme paucity of information in these displays, humans can recognize MLDs generated from a variety of common human movements. This dissertation explores the high-level representations and computational processes required for the recognition task. The structures and algorithms are articulated in the language of structured connectionist models. The implemented network can discriminate three human gaits from data generated by several actors. .pp Recognition of any motion involves indexing into stored models of movement. We present a representation for such models, called scenarios, based on coordinated sequences of discrete motion events. A method for indexing into this representation is described. We develop a parallel model of spatial and conceptual attention that is essential for disambiguating the spatially and temporally diffuse MLD data. The major computational problems addressed are: (1) representation of time-varying visual models; (2) integration of visual stimuli over time; (3) gestalt formation in and between spatially-localized feature maps and central movement representations; (4) contextual feedback to lower levels; and (5) the use of attention to focus processing on particular spatial locations and particular high-level representations. Several novel connectionist mechanisms are developed and used in the implementation. .pp In particular, we present advances in connectionist representation of temporal sequences and in using high-level knowledge to control an attentional mechanism. We show that recognition of gait can be achieved directly from motion features, without complex shape information, and that the motion information need not be finely quantized. We show how the \"what\" and \"where\" processes in vision can be tightly coupled in a synergistic fashion. These results indicate the value of the structured connectionist paradigm in modeling perceptual processes: no previous computational model has accounted for MLD recognition and we do not know how it would be approached in any other paradigm."

The basic idea is to identify sets of constraints that are diagnostic of a movement: expressed using body-centered coordinates such as joint angles and in force only during a particular movement. Assuming the availability of Cartesian tracking data, we develop techniques for a representation of movements defined by space curves in subspaces of a \"phase space.\" The phase space has axes of joint angles and torso location and attitude, and the axes of the subspaces are subsets of the axes of the phase space. Using this representation we develop a system for learning new movements from ground truth data by searching for constraints. We then use the learned representation for recognizing movements in unsegmented data. We train and test the system on nine fundamental steps from classical ballet performed by two dancers; the system accurately recognizes the movements in the unsegmented stream of motion.<<ETX>>"

A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore, the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on synthetic and real image sequences."

One such representation, called layered representation, has recently been proposed. Although a number of algorithms have been developed for computing these representations, there has not been a consolidated effort into developing a precise mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper presents one such formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixture models and the minimum description length (MDL) encoding principle. The three major issues in layered motion representation are: (i) how many motion models adequately describe image motion, (ii) what are the motion model parameters, and (iii) what is the spatial support layer for each motion model.<<ETX>>"

For a given gesture, these states are used to capture both the repeatability and variability evidenced in a training set of example trajectories. The states are positioned along a prototype of the gesture, and shaped such that they are narrow in the directions in which the ensemble of examples is tightly constrained, and wide in directions in which a great deal of variability is observed. We develop techniques for computing a prototype trajectory of an ensemble of trajectories, for defining configuration states along the prototype, and for recognizing gestures from an unsegmented, continuous stream of sensor data. The approach is illustrated by application to a range of gesture-related sensory data: the two-dimensional movements of a mouse input device, the movement of the hand measured by a magnetic spatial position and orientation sensor, and, lastly, the changing eigenvector projection coefficients computed from an image sequence.<<ETX>>"

The rst component takes real image sequences acquired from multiple views and recovers the 3-D body pose at each time instant. The pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails nding the pose parameters of a graphical human model for which its synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. Currently, we use a best-rst search technique and chamfer matching as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. The second component of our system deals with the representation and recognition of human movement patterns. The recognition of human movement patterns is considered as a classiication problem involving the matching of a test sequence with several reference sequences representing prototypical activities. A variation of dynamic time-warping is used to match movement patterns using 3-D joint angles as features. We illustrate our approach on real data acquired simultaneously from three views and data derived from stereo Moving Light Displays with diierent types of hand-gestures."

Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10\u201312 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive."

Previous systems have concentrated on finger spelling or isolated word recognition, often using tethered electronic gloves for input. We achieve high recognition rates for full sentence ASL using only visual cues. A forty word lexicon consisting of personal pronouns, verbs, nouns, and adjectives is used to create 494 randomly constructed five word sentences that are signed by the subject to the computer. The data is separated into a 395 sentence training set and an independent 99 sentence test set. While signing, the 2D position, orientation, and eccentricity of bounding ellipses of the hands are tracked in real time with the assistance of solidly colored gloves. Simultaneous recognition and segmentation of the resultant stream of feature vectors occurs five times faster than real time on an HP 735. With a strong grammar, the system achieves an accuracy of 97%; with no grammar, an accuracy of 91% is reached (95% correct)."

Parametric flow models (for example affine) are popular for estimating motion in rigid scenes. We observe that within local regions in space and time, such models not only accurately model non-rigid facial motions but also provide a concise description of the motion in terms of a small number of parameters. These parameters are intuitively related to the motion of facial features during facial expressions and we show how expressions such as anger, happiness, surprise, fear, disgust and sadness can be recognized from the local parametric motions in the presence of significant head motion. The motion tracking and expression recognition approach performs with high accuracy in extensive laboratory experiments involving 40 subjects as well as in television and movie sequences.<<ETX>>"

Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

This merging process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach is computationally efficient, and that it can provide robust estimates of the optical flow values in the presence of outliers and multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The second process, which employs a new human body model, interprets the outline and produces a labeled two-dimensional human body stick figure for each frame of the image sequence. Extensive knowledge of the structure, shape, and posture of the human body is used in the model.

We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations.

This produces a muscle based representation of facial motion, which is then used to recognize facial expressions in two different ways. The first method uses the physics based model directly, by recognizing expressions through comparison of estimated muscle activations. The second method uses the physics based model to generate spatio temporal motion energy templates of the whole face for each different expression. These simple, biologically plausible motion energy \"templates\" are then used for recognition. Both methods show substantially greater accuracy at expression recognition than has been previously achieved.<<ETX>>"

We use the orientation histogram as a feature vector for gesture class cation and interpolation. This method is simple and fast to compute, and o ers some robustness to scene illumination changes. We have implemented a real-time version, which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 di erent hand gestures. All the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize the image. A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control, or play a game. We discuss limitations of this method. For moving or \\dynamic gestures\", the histogram of the spatio-temporal gradients of image intensity form the analogous feature vector and may be useful for dynamic gesture recognition.

This paper discusses properties of the EM algorithm in such contexts, concentrating on rates of conver- gence, and presents an alternative that is usually more practical and converges at least as quickly. The EM algorithm is a general approach to maximum likelihood estimation, rather than a specific algorithm. Dempster et al. (1977) discussed the method and derived basic properties, demonstrating that a variety of procedures previously developed rather informally could be unified. The common strand to problems where the approach is applicable is a notion of 'incomplete data'; this includes the conventional sense of 'missing data' but is much broader than that. The EM algorithm demon- strates its strength in situations where some hypothetical experiment yields data from which estimation is particularly convenient and economical: the 'incomplete' data actually at hand are regarded as observable functions of these 'complete' data. The resulting algorithms, while usually slow to converge, are often extremely simple and remain practical in large problems where no other approaches may be feasible. Dempster et al. (1977) briefly refer to the use of the same approach to the problem of finding the posterior mode (maximum a posteriori estimate) in a Bayesian estima-"
