                "text": "The objective of this study was to compare how well medical professionals are able to retrieve relevant literature references using two computerized literature searching systems that provide automated (non-human) indexing of content. The first program was SAPHIRE, which features concept-based indexing, free-text input of queries, and ranking of retrieved references for relevance. The second program was SWORD, which provides single-word searching using Boolean operators (AND, OR). Sixteen fourth-year medical students partici pated in the study. The database for searching was six volumes from the 1989 Yearbook series. The queries were ten questions generated on teaching rounds. All subjects searched half the queries with each program. After the searching, each subject was given a ques tionnaire about prior experience and preferences about the two programs. Recall (proportion of relevant articles retrieved from the database) and precision (proportion of relevant articles in the retrieved set) were measured for each search done by each participant. Mean recall was 57.6% with SAPHIRE; it was 58.6% with SWORD. Precision was 48.1% with SAPHIRE VS 57.6% with SWORD. Each program was rated easier to use than the other by half of the searchers, and preferences were associated with better searching performance for that program. Both systems achieved recall and precision comparable to existing systems and may represent effective alternatives to MEDLINE and other retrieval systems based on human indexing for searching medical literature. Key words: information retrieval systems; auto mated indexing; medical literature; MEDLINE. (Med Decis Making 1993;13:220-226)"

Failure analysis assessed the efficacy of the Metathesaurus as a concept vocabulary; the reasons for retrieval of nonrelevant articles and nonretrieval of relevant articles; and the effect of changing the weighting formula for relevance ranking of retrieved articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRecall and precision of SAPHIRE were comparable to those of both physician groups, but less than those of librarians.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe current version of the Metathesaurus, as utilized by SAPHIRE, was unable to represent the conceptual content of one-fourth of physician-generated MEDLINE queries. The most likely cause for retrieval of nonrelevant articles was the presence of some or all of the search terms in the article, with frequencies high enough to lead to retrieval. The most likely cause for nonretrieval of relevant articles was the absence of the actual terms from the query, with synonyms or hierarchically related terms present instead. There were significant variations in performance when SAPHIRE's concept-weighing formulas were modified."

The results obtained with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing. A replacement of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent. When an automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing. Finally, the incorporation of user feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS output of 15 to 30 percent. \n \n \n \nOne concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments."

There was a large variety of retrieval techniques reported on, including methods using automatic thesaurii, sophisticated term weighting, natural language techniques, relevance feedback, and advanced pattern matching. As results had been run through a common evaluation package, groups were able to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, and discuss how differences among the sytems affected performance."

Networks have been used to support diverse retrieval functions, including browsing [38], document clustering [7], spreading activation search [4], support for multiple search strategies [11], and representation of user knowledge [27] or document content [40]. Recent work suggests that significant improvements in retrieval performance will require techniques that, in some sense \u201cunderstand\u201d the content of documents and queries [9, 43] and can be used to infer probable relationships between documents and queries. In this view, information retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process in which we estimate the probability that a user\u2019s information need, expressed as one or more queries, is met given a document as \u201cevidence.\u201d Network representations show promise as mechanisms for inferring these kinds of relationships [4, 12]."

Participants were offered a 2-hour introduction to online searching and 2 hours of free search time.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nFor each search, a computer program requested identification of the user and the question to be addressed. Search transactions were recorded automatically. Interviews were conducted after a random sample of searches, and search questions were given to more expert searchers to run for comparison with the original. Eighty-one percent of participants did searches on study computers, at a mean rate of 2.7 searches per month. On comparison searches, participants retrieved 55% of the number of relevant articles retrieved by reference librarians (P = 0.024) and 50% more irrelevant articles (P less than 0.001). Forty-seven percent of searches on patient problems affected clinical decisions, but often on scanty information.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMEDLINE searching from clinical settings is feasible with brief training and affects clinical decisions. However, inexperienced searchers miss many relevant citations and search inefficiently. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of searching on physician performance and patient care."

While any document is in principle retrievable by a Boolean query, the amount of output obtainable by Boolean processing is difficult to control, and the retrieved items are not ranked in any presumed order of importance to the user population. In the vector processing model of retrieval, the retrieved items are easily ranked in decreasing order of the query-record similarity, but the queries themselves are unstructured and expressed as simple sets of weighted index terms. A new, extended Boolean information retrieval system is introduced which is intermediate between the Boolean system of query processing and the vector processing model. The query structure inherent in the Boolean system is preserved, while at the same time weighted terms may be incorporated into both queries and stored documents; the retrieved output can also be ranked in strict similarity order with the user queries. A conventional retrieval system can be modified to make use of the extended system. Laboratory tests indicate that the extended system produces better retrieval output than either the Boolean or the vector processing systems."
