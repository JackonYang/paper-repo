In this article we develop a similar adaptive element, but one which is more closely in accord with the facts of animal learning theory than elements commonly studied in adaptive network research. We suggest that an essential feature of classical conditioning that has been largely overlooked by adaptive network theorists is its predictive nature. The adaptive element we present learns to increase its response rate in anticipation of increased stimulation, producing a conditioned response before the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The element also is in strong agreement with the behavioral data regarding the effects of stimulus context, since it is a temporally refined extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model. We show by computer simulation that the element becomes sensitive to the most reliable, nonredundant, and earliest predictors of reinforcement . We also point out that the model solves many of the stability and saturation problems encountered in network simulations. Finally, we discuss our model in light of recent advances in the physiology and biochemistry of synaptic mechanisms."

After each winning game the decisions of the adaptive system are \"rewarded.\" After each losing game the decisions are \"punished.\" Reward is accomplished by adapting while accepting the actual decision as the desired response. Punishment is accomplished by adapting while taking the desired response to be the opposite of that of the actual decision. This learning scheme is unlike \"learning with a teacher\" and unlike \"unsupervised learning.\" It involves \"bootstrap adaptation\" or \"learning with a critic.\" The critic rewards decisions which are members of successful chains of decisions and punishes other decisions. A general analytical model for learning with a critic is formulated and analyzed. The model represents bootstrap learning per se. Although the hypotheses on which the model is based do not perfectly fit blackjack learning, it is applied heuristically to predict adaptation rates with good experimental success. New applications are being explored for bootstrap learning in adaptive controls and multilayered adaptive systems."

The task of the Critic was described as threefold: evaluation of the past actions of the performance element of the learning system, localization of credit and blame to particular portions of that performance element, and recommendation of possible improvements and modifications in the performance element. This article analyzes these three tasks in detail and surveys the methods that have been employed in existing learning systems to accomplish them. The principle method used to evaluate the performance element is to develop a global performance standard by (a) consulting an external source of knowledge, (b) consulting an internal source of knowledge, or (c) conducting deep search. Credit and blame have been localized by (a) asking an external knowledge source to do the localization, (b) factoring the global performance standard to produce a local performance standard, and (c) conducting controlled experiments on the performance element. Recommendations have been conmiunicated to the learning element using (a) local training instances, (b) correlation coefficients, and (c) partially-instantiated schemata."

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

The theory provides a single unifying framework within which the neurophysiological, psychological, and sociological properties of living adaptive systems can be understood. Furthermore, the theory offers a new basis for the synthesis of machines possessing adaptive intelligence. The proposed theory is of a heterostatic type. That is to say, it is a theory which assumes that living adaptive systems seek, as their primary goal, a maximal condition (heterostasis) , rather than assuming that the primary goal is a steadystate condition (homeostasis). It is further assumed that the heterostatic nature of animals, including man, derives from the heterostatic nature of neurons. The postulate that the neuron is a heterostat (that is, a maximizer) is a generalization of a more specific postulate, namely, that the neuron is a hedonist. This latter postulate is interpreted strictly in terms of physical variables, yielding the heterostatic neuronal model that is the basis for the detailed development of the theory."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The approach differs from conventional ones in its emphasis on handling distribution-caused uncertainty and errors as an integral part of the network problem-solving process. In this approach nodes cooperatively problem-solve by exchanging partial tentative results (at various levels of abstraction) within the context of common goals. The approach is especially suited to applications in which the data necessary to achieve a solution cannot be partitioned in such a way that a node can complete a task without seeing the intermediate state of task processing at other nodes. Much of the inspiration for the FA/C approach comes from the mechanisms used in knowledge-based artificial intelligence (Al) systems for resolving uncertainty caused by noisy input data and the use of approximate knowledge. The appropriateness of the FA/C approach is explored in three application domains: distributed interpretation, distributed network traffic-light control, and distributed planning. Additionally, the relationship between the approach and the structure of management organizations is developed. Finally, a number of current research directions necessary to more fully develop the FA/C approach are outlined. These research directions include distributed search, the integration of implicit and explicit forms of control, and distributed planning and organizational self-design."
