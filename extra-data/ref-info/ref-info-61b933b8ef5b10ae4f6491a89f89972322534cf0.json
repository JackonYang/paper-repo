Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

                "text": "This paper describes a visual object detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

Our approach to shape description is a formal model of a shape consisting of a set of primitives, their properties, and their interrelationships. The primitives are the simple parts and intrusions of the shape which can be derived through the graph-theoretic clustering procedure described in [31]. The interrelationships are two ternary relations on the primitives: the intrusion relation which relates two simple parts that join to the intrusion they surround and the protrusion relation which relates two intrusions to the protrusion between them. Using this model, a shape matching procedure that uses a tree search with look-ahead to find mappings from a prototype shape to a candidate shape has been developed. An experimental Snobol4 implementation has been used to test the program on hand-printed character data with favorable results."

We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions.

Although cells within a column respond to similar features, their selectivity is not necessarily identical. The data of optical imaging in TE have suggested that the borders between neighboring columns are not discrete; a continuous mapping of complex feature space within a larger region contains several partially overlapped columns. This continuous mapping may be used for various computations, such as production of the image of the object at different viewing angles, illumination conditions, and articulation poses."

This method concentrates on the morphological aspect of cursive script recognition. It uses fuzzy-shape grammars to define the morphological characteristics of conventional allographs which can be viewed as basic knowledge for developing a writer independent recognition system. The system uses no linguistic knowledge to output character sequences that possibly correspond to an unknown cursive word input. The recognition method is tested using multi-writer cursive random letter sequences. For a test dataset containing a handwritten cursive text 600 characters in length written by ten different writers, average character recognition rates of 84.4% to 91.6% are obtained, depending on whether only the best character sequence output of the system is considered or if the best of the top 10 is accepted. These results are achieved without any writer-dependent tuning. The same dataset is used to evaluate the performance of human readers. An average recognition rate of 96.0% was reached, using ten different readers, presented with randomized samples of each writer. The worst reader-writer performance was 78.3%. Moreover, results show that system performances are highly correlated with human performances. >"
