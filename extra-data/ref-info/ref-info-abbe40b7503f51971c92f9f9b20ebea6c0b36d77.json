In previous research, LSI has produced a small improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper, we apply LSI to the routing task, which operates under the assumption that a sample of relevant and non-relevant documents is available to use in constructing the query. Once again, LSI slightly improves performance. However, when LSI is used is conjuction with statistical classification, there is a dramatic improvement in performance."

There are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we achieved these results in about two person-months.

                "text": "This dissertation introduces a new theoretical model for text classification systems, including systems for document retrieval, automated indexing, electronic mail filtering, and similar tasks. The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods."

The fact that different authors use different words to describe essentially the same idea means that relevant objects will be missed; conversely, the fact that the same word can be used to refer to many different things means that irrelevant objects will be retrieved. We describe a statistical method called latent semantic indexing, which models the implicit higher order structure in the association of words and objects and improves retrieval performance by up to 30%. Additional large performance improvements of 40% and 67% can be achieved through the use of differential term weighting and iterative retrieval methods."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."
