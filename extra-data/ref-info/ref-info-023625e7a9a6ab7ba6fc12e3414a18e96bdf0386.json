Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images."

Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This formulation differs in two ways from the most frequently considered clustering problems in the literature, namely, here we have k fixed and m, n variable, and we use the sum of squared distances as our measure; we will argue that our problem is natural in many contexts. We consider a relaxation of the discrete problem: find the k-dimensional subspace V so that the sum of distances squared to V (of the m points) is minimized. We show: (i) The relaxation can be solved by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of Linear Algebra. (ii) The solution of the relaxation can be used to get a 2-approximation algorithm for the original problem. More importantly, (iii) we argue that in fact the relaxation provides a generalized clustering which is useful in its own right. Finally, (iv) we show that the SVD of a randomly chosen submatrix (according to a suitable probability distribution) of the matrix provides an approximation to the SVD of the whole matrix, thus yielding a very fast randomized algorithm. This cam be applied to problems of very large size which typically arise in modern applications."

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of \u201cauthorative\u201d information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of \u201chub pages\u201d that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis."
