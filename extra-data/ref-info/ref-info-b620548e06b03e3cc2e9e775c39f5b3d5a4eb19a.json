We propose a novel Cascaded Convolutional Text Network (CCTN) that joints two customized convolutional networks for coarse-to-fine text localization. The CCTN fast detects text regions roughly from a low-resolution image, and then accurately localizes text lines from each enlarged region. We cast previous character based detection into direct text region estimation, avoiding multiple bottom- up post-processing steps. It exhibits surprising robustness and discriminative power by considering whole text region as detection object which provides strong semantic information. We customize convolutional network by develop- ing rectangle convolutions and multiple in-network fusions. This enables it to handle multi-shape and multi-scale text efficiently. Furthermore, the CCTN is computationally efficient by sharing convolutional computations, and high-level property allows it to be invariant to various languages and multiple orientations. It achieves 0.84 and 0.86 F-measures on the ICDAR 2011 and ICDAR 2013, delivering substantial improvements over state-of-the-art results [23, 1]."

                "text": "Recent deep learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities for classifying text and non-text components in natural images. They extract a high-level feature globally computed from a whole image component (patch), where the cluttered background information may dominate true text features in the deep representation. This leads to less discriminative power and poorer robustness. In this paper, we present a new system for scene text detection by proposing a novel text-attentional convolutional neural network (Text-CNN) that particularly focuses on extracting text-related regions and features from the image components. We develop a new learning mechanism to train the Text-CNN with multi-level and rich supervised information, including text region mask, character label, and binary text/non-text information. The rich supervision information enables the Text-CNN with a strong capability for discriminating ambiguous texts, and also increases its robustness against complicated background components. The training process is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, where low-level supervised information greatly facilitates the main task of text/non-text classification. In addition, a powerful low-level detector called contrast-enhancement maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) is developed, which extends the widely used MSERs by enhancing intensity contrast between text patterns and background. This allows it to detect highly challenging text patterns, resulting in a higher recall. Our approach achieved promising results on the ICDAR 2013 data set, with an F-measure of 0.82, substantially improving the state-of-the-art results."

We leverage recent advances of deep convolutional neural networks to generate an ordered highlevel sequence from a whole word image, avoiding the difficult character segmentation problem. Then a deep recurrent model, building on long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to robustly recognize the generated CNN sequences, departing from most existing approaches recognising each character independently. Our model has a number of appealing properties in comparison to existing scene text recognition methods: (i) It can recognise highly ambiguous words by leveraging meaningful context information, allowing it to work reliably without either pre- or post-processing; (ii) the deep CNN feature is robust to various image distortions; (iii) it retains the explicit order information in word image, which is essential to discriminate word strings; (iv) the model does not depend on pre-defined dictionary, and it can process unknown words and arbitrary strings. It achieves impressive results on several benchmarks, advancing the-state-of-the-art substantially.\n \n"

This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

Both local and global cues are taken into account for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine procedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model is trained to predict the salient map of text regions in a holistic manner. Then, text line hypotheses are estimated by combining the salient map and character components. Finally, another FCN classifier is used to predict the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The framework is general for handling text in multiple orientations, languages and fonts. The proposed method consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three text detection benchmarks: MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015 and ICDAR2013."

However, errors occur and accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection of texts in different languages."

The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU."

This problem is challenging due to the complex background, the non-uniform illumination, the variations of text font, size and line orientation. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to robustly detect and localize texts in natural scene images. A text region detector is designed to estimate the text existing confidence and scale information in image pyramid, which help segment candidate text components by local binarization. To efficiently filter out the non-text components, a conditional random field (CRF) model considering unary component properties and binary contextual component relationships with supervised parameter learning is proposed. Finally, text components are grouped into text lines/words with a learning-based energy minimization method. Since all the three stages are learning-based, there are very few parameters requiring manual tuning. Experimental results evaluated on the ICDAR 2005 competition dataset show that our approach yields higher precision and recall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated our approach on a multilingual image dataset with promising results."

However, this low-level pixel operation inherently limits its capability for handling complex text information efficiently (e. g. connections between text or background components), leading to the difficulty in distinguishing texts from background components. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle this problem by leveraging the high capability of convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to recent methods using a set of low-level heuristic features, the CNN network is capable of learning high-level features to robustly identify text components from text-like outliers (e.g. bikes, windows, or leaves). Our approach takes advantages of both MSERs and sliding-window based methods. The MSERs operator dramatically reduces the number of windows scanned and enhances detection of the low-quality texts. While the sliding-window with CNN is applied to correctly separate the connections of multiple characters in components. The proposed system achieved strong robustness against a number of extreme text variations and serious real-world problems. It was evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 benchmark dataset, and achieved over 78% in F-measure, which is significantly higher than previous methods."

This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learning with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures."

Firstly, a powerful low-level filter called the Stroke Feature Transform (SFT) is proposed, which extends the widely-used Stroke Width Transform (SWT) by incorporating color cues of text pixels, leading to significantly enhanced performance on inter-component separation and intra-component connection. Secondly, based on the output of SFT, we apply two classifiers, a text component classifier and a text-line classifier, sequentially to extract text regions, eliminating the heuristic procedures that are commonly used in previous approaches. The two classifiers are built upon two novel Text Covariance Descriptors (TCDs) that encode both the heuristic properties and the statistical characteristics of text stokes. Finally, text regions are located by simply thresholding the text-line confident map. Our method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ICDAR 2005 and ICDAR 2011, and the corresponding F-measure values are 0.72 and 0.73, respectively, surpassing previous methods in accuracy by a large margin."

In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust method for detecting texts in natural scene images. A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and clustering threshold are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with a character classifier; text candidates with high non-text probabilities are eliminated and texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition database; the f-measure is over 76%, much better than the state-of-the-art performance of 71%. Experiments on multilingual, street view, multi-orientation and even born-digital databases also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios."

Unlike document text, scene text usually exhibits large variations in font and language, and suffers from low resolution, occlusions and complex background. In this paper, we present a novel scale-based region growing algorithm for scene text detection. We first distinguish SIFT features in text regions from those in background by exploring the inter- and intra-statistics of SIFT features. Then scene text regions in images are identified by scale-based region growing, which explores the geometric context of SIFT keypoints in local regions. Our algorithm is very effective to detect multilingual text in various fonts, sizes, and with complex background. In addition, it offers insights on efficiently deploying local features in numerous applications, such as visual search. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performance."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

In this paper, we present a unified framework for text detection and recognition in natural images. The contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) text detection and recognition are accomplished concurrently using exactly the same features and classification scheme; 2) in contrast to methods in the literature, which mainly focus on horizontal or near-horizontal texts, the proposed system is capable of localizing and reading texts of varying orientations; and 3) a new dictionary search method is proposed, to correct the recognition errors usually caused by confusions among similar yet different characters. As an additional contribution, a novel image database with texts of different scales, colors, fonts, and orientations in diverse real-world scenarios, is generated and released. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as the proposed database demonstrate that the proposed system achieves highly competitive performance, especially on multioriented texts."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

Its real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection and segmentation problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions. The ER detector is robust against blur, low contrast and illumination, color and texture variation. In the first stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using features calculated by a novel algorithm in constant time and only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification accuracy is improved using computationally more expensive features. A highly efficient clustering algorithm then groups ERs into text lines and an OCR classifier trained on synthetic fonts is exploited to label character regions. The most probable character sequence is selected in the last stage when the context of each character is known. The method was evaluated on three public datasets. On the ICDAR 2013 dataset the method achieves state-of-the-art results in text localization; on the more challenging SVT dataset, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that the proposed pipeline can incorporate additional prior knowledge about the detected text. The proposed method was exploited as the baseline in the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading competition, where it compares favourably to the state-of-the art."

Stroke-specific keypoints are efficiently detected and text fragments are subsequently extracted by local thresholding guided by keypoint properties. Classification based on effectively calculated features then eliminates non-text regions. The stroke-specific keypoints produce 2 times less region segmentations and still detect 25% more characters than the commonly exploited MSER detector and the process is 4 times faster. After a novel efficient classification step, the number of regions is reduced to 7 times less than the standard method and is still almost 3 times faster. All stages of the proposed pipeline are scale-and rotation-invariant and support a wide variety of scripts (Latin, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.) and fonts. When the proposed detector is plugged into a scene text localization and recognition pipeline, a state-of-the-art text localization accuracy is maintained whilst the processing time is significantly reduced."

For instance, in an urban context, the detection is very difficult due to large variations in terms of shape, size, color, orientation, and the image may be blurred or have irregular illumination, etc. In this paper, we describe a robust and accurate multiresolution approach to detect and classify text regions in such scenarios. Based on generation/validation paradigm, we first segment images to detect character regions with a multiresolution algorithm able to manage large character size variations. The segmented regions are then filtered out using shapebased classification, and neighboring characters are merged to generate text hypotheses. A validation step computes a region signature based on texture analysis to reject false positives. We evaluate our algorithm in two challenging databases, achieving very good results."

                "text": "Text detection in natural scene images is an important prerequisite for many content-based image analysis tasks, while most current research efforts only focus on horizontal or near horizontal scene text. In this paper, first we present a unified distance metric learning framework for adaptive hierarchical clustering, which can simultaneously learn similarity weights (to adaptively combine different feature similarities) and the clustering threshold (to automatically determine the number of clusters). Then, we propose an effective multi-orientation scene text detection system, which constructs text candidates by grouping characters based on this adaptive clustering. Our text candidates construction method consists of several sequential coarse-to-fine grouping steps: morphology-based grouping via single-link clustering, orientation-based grouping via divisive hierarchical clustering, and projection-based grouping also via divisive clustering. The effectiveness of our proposed system is evaluated on several public scene text databases, e.g., ICDAR Robust Reading Competition data sets (2011 and 2013), MSRA-TD500 and NEOCR. Specifically, on the multi-orientation text data set MSRA-TD500, the <inline-formula><tex-math>$f$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq1-2388210.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> measure of our system is <inline-formula><tex-math>$71$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq2-2388210.gif\"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> percent, much better than the state-of-the-art performance. We also construct and release a practical challenging multi-orientation scene text data set (USTB-SV1K), which is available at http://prir.ustb.edu.cn/TexStar/MOMV-text-detection/."

Challenge 4 is run on a newly acquired dataset of 1,670 images evaluating Text Localisation, Word Recognition and End-to-End pipelines. In addition, the dataset for Challenge 3 on Video Text has been substantially updated with more video sequences and more accurate ground truth data. Finally, tasks assessing End-to-End system performance have been introduced to all Challenges. The competition took place in the first quarter of 2015, and received a total of 44 submissions. Only the tasks newly introduced in 2015 are reported on. The datasets, the ground truth specification and the evaluation protocols are presented together with the results and a brief summary of the participating methods."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

We observe that generic objects with well-defined closed boundaries can be detected by looking at the norm of gradients, with a suitable resizing of their corresponding image windows to a small fixed size. Based on this observation and computational reasons, we propose to resize the window to 8 \u00d7 8 and use the norm of the gradients as a simple 64D feature to describe it, for explicitly training a generic objectness measure. We further show how the binarized version of this feature, namely binarized normed gradients (BING), can be used for efficient objectness estimation, which requires only a few atomic operations (e.g., add, bitwise shift, etc.). To improve localization quality of the proposals while maintaining efficiency, we propose a novel fast segmentation method and demonstrate its effectiveness for improving BING\u2019s localization performance, when used in multi-thresholding straddling expansion (MTSE) post-processing. On the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 dataset, using 1000 proposals per image and intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, our proposal method achieves a 95.6% object detection rate and 78.6% mean average best overlap in less than 0.005 second per image."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia."

The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse.

The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures.In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition."

They extract a high-level feature computed globally from a whole image component (patch), where the cluttered background information may dominate true text features in the deep representation. This leads to less discriminative power and poorer robustness. In this work, we present a new system for scene text detection by proposing a novel Text-Attentional Convolutional Neural Network (Text-CNN) that particularly focuses on extracting text-related regions and features from the image components. We develop a new learning mechanism to train the Text-CNN with multi-level and rich supervised information, including text region mask, character label, and binary text/nontext information. The rich supervision information enables the Text-CNN with a strong capability for discriminating ambiguous texts, and also increases its robustness against complicated background components. The training process is formulated as a multi-task learning problem, where low-level supervised information greatly facilitates main task of text/non-text classification. In addition, a powerful low-level detector called Contrast- Enhancement Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (CE-MSERs) is developed, which extends the widely-used MSERs by enhancing intensity contrast between text patterns and background. This allows it to detect highly challenging text patterns, resulting in a higher recall. Our approach achieved promising results on the ICDAR 2013 dataset, with a F-measure of 0.82, improving the state-of-the-art results substantially."
