This paper presents an in-depth experimental study on pedestrian classification; multiple feature-classifier combinations are examined with respect to their ROC performance and efficiency. We investigate global versus local and adaptive versus nonadaptive features, as exemplified by PCA coefficients, Haar wavelets, and local receptive fields (LRFs). In terms of classifiers, we consider the popular support vector machines (SVMs), feedforward neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor classifier. Experiments are performed on a large data set consisting of 4,000 pedestrian and more than 25,000 nonpedestrian (labeled) images captured in outdoor urban environments. Statistically meaningful results are obtained by analyzing performance variances caused by varying training and test sets. Furthermore, we investigate how classification performance and training sample size are correlated. Sample size is adjusted by increasing the number of manually labeled training data or by employing automatic bootstrapping or cascade techniques. Our experiments show that the novel combination of SVMs with LRF features performs best. A boosted cascade of Haar wavelets can, however, reach quite competitive results, at a fraction of computational cost. The data set used in this paper is made public, establishing a benchmark for this important problem"

We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

Typically an object is represented in terms of a model shape. A new shape is classified as being an instance of the object when the Hausdorff distance between the model and the new shape is small. We show that such object concepts can be seen as halfspaces (linear threshold functions) in a transformed input space. This makes it possible to use a number of standard algorithms to learn object models from training examples. When a good model exists, we are guaranteed to find one that provides (with high probability) a recognition rule that is accurate. Our approach provides a measure which generalizes the Hausdorff distance in a number of interesting ways. To demonstrate our method we trained a system to detect people in images using a single shape model. The learning techniques can be extended to represent objects using multiple model shapes. In this way, we might be able to automatically learn a small set of canonical shapes that characterize the appearance of an object."

We present a general framework that uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the best arrangement for people in terms of 2D translation that yields a segmentation for the foreground region. Given the segmentation result we conduct occlusion reasoning to recover relative depth information and we show how to utilize this depth information in the same segmentation framework. We also present a more practical solution for the segmentation problem that is online to avoid searching an exponential space of hypothesis. The person model is based on segmenting the body into regions in order to spatially localize the color-features corresponding to the way people are dressed. Modeling these regions involves modeling their appearance (color distributions) as well us their spatial distribution with respect to the body. We use a non-parametric approach bused on kernel density estimation to represent the color distribution of each region and therefore we do not restrict the clothing to be of uniform color instead it can be any mixture of colors and/or patterns. We also present a method to automatically initialize these models and learn them before the occlusion."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

Unfortunately, this often leads to models that are not robust when features are removed or obscured in future test data. For example, a backprop net trained to steer a car typically learns to recognize the edges of the road, but does not learn to recognize other features such as the stripes painted on the road which could be useful when road edges disappear in tunnels or are obscured by passing trucks. The net learns the minimum necessary to steer on the training set. In contrast, human driving is remarkably robust as features become obscured. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for robust learning that biases induction to learn many different models from the same inputs. We present a meta algorithm for robust learning called FeatureBoost, and demonstrate it on several problems using backprop nets, k-nearest neighbor, and decision trees."

When multiple detectors of objects and parts are trained in parallel using AdaBoost [1], object detectors might use the remaining intermediate detectors to enrich the weak learner set. This method generalizes the efficient features suggested by Viola and Jones [2] thus enabling information inference between parts and objects in a compositional hierarchy. In our experiments eye-, nose-, mouth- and face detectors are trained using the Mutual Boosting framework. Results show that the method outperforms applications overlooking contextual information. We suggest that achieving contextual integration is a step toward human-like detection capabilities."

It is based on the linear decomposition of each object in the image into a series of localized basis functions of different shapes, which we call \u2018shapelets\u2019. A particularly useful set of complete and orthonormal shapelets is that consisting of weighted Hermite polynomials, which correspond to perturbations around a circular Gaussian. They are also the eigenstates of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, and thus allow us to use the powerful formalism developed for this problem. One of their special properties is their invariance under Fourier transforms (up to a rescaling), leading to an analytic form for convolutions. The generator of linear transformations such as translations, rotations, shears and dilatations can be written as simple combinations of raising and lowering operators. We derive analytic expressions for practical quantities, such as the centroid (astrometry), flux (photometry) and radius of the object, in terms of its shapelet coefficients. We also construct polar basis functions which are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator, and thus have simple properties under rotations. As an example, we apply the method to Hubble Space Telescope images, and show that the small number of shapelet coefficients required to represent galaxy images lead to compression factors of about 40 to 90. We discuss applications of shapelets for the archival of large photometric surveys, for weak and strong gravitational lensing and for image deprojection."

Many shape measurement algorithms such as shape from shading and shape from texture only return the surface normals of an object, often with an ambiguity of pi in the surface tilt. The surface shape has to be inferred from these normals, typically via some integration process. However; reconstruction through the integration of surface gradients is sensitive to noise and the choice of integration paths across the surface. In addition, existing techniques cannot accommodate ambiguities in tilt. This paper presents a new approach to the reconstruction of surfaces from surface normals using basis functions, referred to here as shapelets. The surface gradients of the shapelets are correlated with the gradients of the surface and the correlations summed to form the reconstruction. This results in a simple reconstruction process that is very robust to noise. Where there is an ambiguity of it in the surface tilt, reconstructions of reduced quality are still possible up to a positive/negative shape ambiguity. Intriguingly, some form of reconstruction is also possible using just slant information"

We give a simplified analysis of AdaBoost in this setting, and we show how this analysis can be used to find improved parameter settings as well as a refined criterion for training weak hypotheses. We give a specific method for assigning confidences to the predictions of decision trees, a method closely related to one used by Quinlan. This method also suggests a technique for growing decision trees which turns out to be identical to one proposed by Kearns and Mansour. We focus next on how to apply the new boosting algorithms to multiclass classification problems, particularly to the multi-label case in which each example may belong to more than one class. We give two boosting methods for this problem, plus a third method based on output coding. One of these leads to a new method for handling the single-label case which is simpler but as effective as techniques suggested by Freund and Schapire. Finally, we give some experimental results comparing a few of the algorithms discussed in this paper."
