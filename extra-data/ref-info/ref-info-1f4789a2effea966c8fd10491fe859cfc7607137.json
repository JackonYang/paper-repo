We represent prior knowledge of 3D shapes and scenes by probabilistic models at two levels - both are defined on graphs. The first level model is built on a graph representation for single objects, and it is a mixture model for both man-made block objects such as trees and grasses. It assumes surface and boundary smoothness, 3D angle symmetry etc. The second level model is built on the relation graph of all objects in a scene. It assumes that objects should be supported for maximum stability with global bounding surfaces, such as ground, sky and walls. Given an input image, we extract the geometry and photometric structures through image segmentation and sketching, and represent them in a big graph. Then we partition the graph into subgraphs each being an object, infer the 3D shape and recover occluded surfaces, edges and vertices in each subgraph, and infer the scene structures between the recovered 3D sub-graphs. The inference algorithm samples from the prior model under the constraint that it reproduces the observed image/sketch under projective geometry."

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps."

We propose a simple, geometrically intuitive method which exploits the strong rigidity constraints of paral-lelism and orthogonality present in indoor and outdoor architectural scenes. We present a n o vel algorithm that uses these simple constraints to recover the projection matrices for each viewpoint and relate our method to the algorithm of Caprile and Torre 2]. The projection matrices are used to recover partial 3D models of the scene and these can be used to visualise new viewpoints. Our approach d o e s not need any a priori information about the cameras being used. A w orking system called PhotoBuilder has been designed and implemented to allow a user to interactively build a VRML model of a building from uncalibrated images from arbitrary viewpoints 3, 4 ]."

Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

This minimal information is typically the vanishing line of a reference plane, and a vanishing point for a direction not parallel to the plane. It is shown that affine scene structure may then be determined from the image, without knowledge of the camera's internal calibration (e.g. focal length), nor of the explicit relation between camera and world (pose).In particular, we show how to (i) compute the distance between planes parallel to the reference plane (up to a common scale factor); (ii) compute area and length ratios on any plane parallel to the reference plane; (iii) determine the camera's location. Simple geometric derivations are given for these results. We also develop an algebraic representation which unifies the three types of measurement and, amongst other advantages, permits a first order error propagation analysis to be performed, associating an uncertainty with each measurement.We demonstrate the technique for a variety of applications, including height measurements in forensic images and 3D graphical modelling from single images."

We construct a Bayesian model that implements this assumption and estimates the viewer orientation relative to the Manhattan grid. For many images, these estimates are good approximations to the viewer orientation (as estimated manually by the authors). These estimates also make it easy to detect outlier structures that are unaligned to the grid. To determine the applicability of the Manhattan world model, we implement a null hypothesis model that assumes that the image statistics are independent of any three-dimensional scene structure. We then use the log-likelihood ratio test to determine whether an image satisfies the Manhattan world assumption. Our results show that if an image is estimated to be Manhattan, then the Bayesian model's estimates of viewer direction are almost always accurate (according to our manual estimates), and vice versa."

Our system first recovers the camera pose for each mosaic from known line directions and points, and then constructs the 3D model using all available geometrical constraints. We partition constraints into soft and hard linear constraints so that the modeling process can be formulated as a linearly-constrained least-squares problem, which can be solved efficiently using QR factorization.

The navigation capabilities of the robot are not impaired by the presence of the stationary or moving obstacles. The vision system maintains a model of uncertainty and keeps track of the growth of uncertainty as the robot travels towards the goal position. The estimates of uncertainty are then used to predict bounds on the locations and orientations of landmarks expected to be seen in a monocular image. This greatly reduces the search for establishing correspondence between the features visible in the image and the landmarks. Given a sequence of image features and a sequence of landmarks derived from a geometric model of the environment, a special aspect of our vision system is the sequential reduction in the uncertainty as each image feature is matched successfully with a landmark, allowing subsequent features to be matched more easily, this being a natural byproduct of the manner in which we use Kalman-filter based updating. Strategies for path planning, path replanning and perception planning are introduced for the robot to navigate in the presence of obstacles. Finally, experimental results are presented."

The work presented in this thesis combines techniques from computer vision and computer graphics to make this possible. The applications range from architectural planning and archaeological reconstructions to virtual environments and cinematic special effects. \nThis thesis presents an approach for modeling and rendering existing architectural scenes from sparse sets of still photographs. The modeling approach, which combines both geometry-based and image-based techniques, has two components. The first component is an interactive photogrammetric modeling method which facilitates the recovery of the basic geometry of the photographed scene. The photogrammetric modeling approach is effective, convenient, and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic of architectural scenes. The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which recovers how the real scene deviates from the basic model. By making use of the model, this new technique robustly recovers accurate depth from widely-spaced image pairs. Consequently, this approach can model large architectural environments with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. For producing renderings, this thesis presents view-dependent texture mapping, a method of compositing multiple views of a scene that better simulates geometric detail on basic models. \nThis approach can be used to recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering systems. This work presents results that demonstrate the approach's ability to create realistic renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs. This thesis concludes with a presentation of how these modeling and rendering techniques were used to create the interactive art installation Rouen Revisited, presented at the SIGGRAPH '96 art show."

We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step.An image stream can be represented by the 2F\u00d7P measurement matrix of the image coordinates of P points tracked through F frames. We show that under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3.Based on this observation, the factorization method uses the singular-value decomposition technique to factor the measurement matrix into two matrices which represent object shape and camera rotation respectively. Two of the three translation components are computed in a preprocessing stage. The method can also handle and obtain a full solution from a partially filled-in measurement matrix that may result from occlusions or tracking failures.The method gives accurate results, and does not introduce smoothing in either shape or motion. We demonstrate this with a series of experiments on laboratory and outdoor image streams, with and without occlusions."

We present an approach in which supervised learning is first used to estimate depths from single monocular images. The learning algorithm can be trained either on real camera images labeled with ground-truth distances to the closest obstacles, or on a training set consisting of synthetic graphics images. The resulting algorithm is able to learn monocular vision cues that accurately estimate the relative depths of obstacles in a scene. Reinforcement learning/policy search is then applied within a simulator that renders synthetic scenes. This learns a control policy that selects a steering direction as a function of the vision system's output. We present results evaluating the predictive ability of the algorithm both on held out test data, and in actual autonomous driving experiments."

We choose one class of primitives - 3D planar rectangles projected on images and six graph grammar production rules. Each production rule not only expands a node into its components, but also includes a number of equations that constrain the attributes of a parent node and those of its children. Thus our graph grammar is context sensitive. The grammar rules are used recursively to produce a large number of objects and patterns in images and thus the whole graph grammar is a type of generative model. The inference algorithm integrates bottom-up rectangle detection which activates top-down prediction using the grammar rules. The final results are validated in a Bayesian framework. The output of the inference is a hierarchical parsing graph with objects, surfaces, rectangles, and their spatial relations. In the inference, the acceptance of a grammar rule means recognition of an object, and actions are taken to pass the attributes between a node and its parent through the constraint equations associated with this production rule. When an attribute is passed from a child node to a parent node, it is called bottom-up, and the opposite is called top-down"

In this paper, six well-known SFS algorithms are implemented and compared. The performance of the algorithms was analyzed on synthetic images using mean and standard deviation of depth (Z) error, mean of surface gradient (p, q) error, and CPU timing. Each algorithm works well for certain images, but performs poorly for others. In general, minimization approaches are more robust, while the other approaches are faster."

Each individual image pixel is classified as belonging either to an obstacle or the ground based on its color appearance. The method uses a single passive color camera, performs in real-time, and provides a binary obstacle image at high resolution. The system is easily trained by simply driving the robot through its environment. In the adaptive mode, the system keeps learning the appearance of the ground during operation. The system has been tested successfully in a variety of environments, indoors as well as outdoors."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

As modeling languages they allow a natural specification of problem domains with inherent uncertainty, and from a computational perspective they support efficient algorithms for automatic construction and query answering. This includes belief updating, finding the most probable explanation for the observed evidence, detecting conflicts in the evidence entered into the network, determining optimal strategies, analyzing for relevance, and performing sensitivity analysis. The book introduces probabilistic graphical models and decision graphs, including Bayesian networks and influence diagrams. The reader is introduced to the two types of frameworks through examples and exercises, which also instruct the reader on how to build these models. The book is a new edition of Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs by Finn V. Jensen. The new edition is structured into two parts. The first part focuses on probabilistic graphical models. Compared with the previous book, the new edition also includes a thorough description of recent extensions to the Bayesian network modeling language, advances in exact and approximate belief updating algorithms, and methods for learning both the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian network. The second part deals with decision graphs, and in addition to the frameworks described in the previous edition, it also introduces Markov decision processes and partially ordered decision problems. The authors also provide a well-founded practical introduction to Bayesian networks, object-oriented Bayesian networks, decision trees, influence diagrams (and variants hereof), and Markov decision processes. give practical advice on the construction of Bayesian networks, decision trees, and influence diagrams from domain knowledge. give several examples and exercises exploiting computer systems for dealing with Bayesian networks and decision graphs. present a thorough introduction to state-of-the-art solution and analysis algorithms. The book is intended as a textbook, but it can also be used for self-study and as a reference book."

We show, contrary to a widely-held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation\u2014which is borne out in repeated experiments\u2014that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster."
