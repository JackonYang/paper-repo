The algorithm, which aims at obtaining the maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation is a simulated annealing algorithm that is interrupted at regular intervals for estimating the GRF parameters. Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters based on the current segmentation are used to obtain the next segmentation. It is proven that the parameter estimates and the segmentations converge in distribution to the ML estimate of the parameters and the MAP segmentation with those parameter estimates, respectively. Due to computational difficulties, however, only an approximate version of the algorithm is implemented. The approximate algorithm is applied on several two- and four-region images with different noise levels and with first-order and second-order neighborhoods. >"

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached. >"

All use Markov random field (MRF) models to include prior contextual information. The comparison is based on artificial binary images which are degraded by Gaussian noise. Robustness is tested with correlated noise and with object and background textured. The ICM algorithm is evaluated when the degradation and model parameters must be estimated, in both supervised and unsupervised modes and on two real images. The results are assessed by visual inspection and through a numerical criterion. It is concluded that contextual information from MRF models improves segmentation when the number of categories and the degradation model are known and that parameters can be effectively estimated. None of the three algorithms is consistently best, but the ICM algorithm is the most robust. The energy of the a posteriori distribution is not always minimized at the best segmentation.<<ETX>>"

The segmentation process is posed as an optimization problem and two different optimality criteria are considered. The first criterion involves maximizing the posterior distribution of the intensity field given the label field (maximum a posteriori estimate). The posterior distribution of the texture labels is derived by modeling the textures as Gauss Markov random fields (GMRFs) and characterizing the distribution of different texture labels by a discrete multilevel Markov model. A stochastic learning algorithm is proposed. This iterated hill-climbing algorithm combines fast convergence of deterministic relaxation with the sustained exploration of the stochastic algorithms, but is guaranteed to find only a local minimum. The second optimality criterion requires minimizing the expected percentage of misclassification per pixel by maximizing the posterior marginal distribution, and the maximum posterior marginal algorithm is used to obtain the corresponding solution. All these methods implemented on parallel networks can be easily extended for hierarchical segmentation; results of the various schemes in classifying some real textured images are presented. >"

Specifically, the paper presents random field models for noisy and textured image data based upon a hierarchy of GD. It then presents dynamic programming based segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images, considering a statistical maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Due to computational concerns, however, sub-optimal versions of the algorithms are devised through simplifying approximations in the model. Since model parameters are needed for the segmentation algorithms, a new parameter estimation technique is developed for estimating the parameters in a GD. Finally, a number of examples are presented which show the usefulness of the Gibbsian model and the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithms and the parameter estimation procedures."

The technique is similar to Gauss-Seidel (GS) iteration for the solution of differential equations on finite grids. The computational cost per iteration of the GS approach is found to be approximately equal to that of gradient methods. For continuously valued images, GS is found to have significantly better convergence at modes representing high spatial frequencies. In addition, GS is well suited to segmentation when the image is constrained to be discretely valued. It is shown that Bayesian segmentation using GS iteration produces useful estimates at much lower signal-to-noise ratios than required for continuously valued reconstruction. The convergence properties of gradient ascent and GS for reconstruction from integral projections are analyzed, and simulations of both maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori cases are included. >"

The algorithm that is presented is a generalization of the K-means clustering algorithm to include spatial constraints and to account for local intensity variations in the image. Spatial constraints are included by the use of a Gibbs random field model. Local intensity variations are accounted for in an iterative procedure involving averaging over a sliding window whose size decreases as the algorithm progresses. Results with an 8-neighbor Gibbs random field model applied to pictures of industrial objects, buildings, aerial photographs, optical characters, and faces show that the algorithm performs better than the K-means algorithm and its nonadaptive extensions that incorporate spatial constraints by the use of Gibbs random fields. A hierarchical implementation is also presented that results in better performance and faster speed of execution. The segmented images are caricatures of the originals which preserve the most significant features, while removing unimportant details. They can be used in image recognition and as crude representations of the image. >"

A natural framework for developing such a theory is the study of stochastic processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in which different depths in the tree or lattice correspond to different spatial scales in representing a signal or image. In particular, it is shown how the wavelet transform directly suggests such a modeling paradigm. This perspective then leads directly to the investigation of several classes of dynamic models and related notions of multiscale stationarity in which scale plays the role of a time-like variable. The investigation of models on homogeneous trees is emphasized. The framework examined here allows for consideration, in a very natural way, of the fusion of data from sensors with differing resolutions. Also, thanks to the fact that wavelet transforms do an excellent job of 'compressing' large classes of covariance kernels, it is seen that these modeling paradigms appear to have promise in a far broader context than one might expect. >"

Local texture properties are extracted using local linear transforms that have been optimized for maximal texture discrimination. Local statistics (texture energy measures) are estimated at the output of an equivalent filter bank by means of a nonlinear transformation (absolute value) followed by an iterative Gaussian smoothing algorithm. This procedure generates a multiresolution sequence of feature planes with a half-octave scale progression. A feature reduction technique is then applied to the data and is determined by simultaneously diagonalizing scatter matrices evaluated at two different spatial resolutions. This approach provides a good approximation of R.A. Fisher's (1950) multiple linear discriminants and has the advantage of requiring no a priori knowledge. This feature reduction methods appears to be an improvement on the commonly used Karhunen-Loeve transform and allows efficient texture segmentation based on simple thresholding. >"

As we describe, a natural framework for developing such atheory is the study of stochastic processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in which different depths in the tree or lattice correspond to different spatial scales in representing a signal or image. In particular we show how the wavelet transform directly suggests such a modeling paradigm. This perspective then leads directly to the investigation of several classes of dynamic models and related notions of \u201cmultiscale stationarity\u201d in which scale plays the role of a time-like variable. In particular we describe the elements of a dynamic system theory on trees based on a specific notion of stationarity on trees. This notion of stationarity leads directly to a class of state space models on homogeneous trees. We describe several elements of the system theory for such models and also describe the natural, extremely efficient algorithmic structures for optimal estimation that these models suggest: one class of algorithms has a multigrid relaxation structure; a second uses the scale-to-scale whitening property of wavelet transforms for our models; and a third leads to a new class of Riccati equations involving the usual predict and update steps and a new \u2018(fusion\u201d step as information is propagated from fine to coarse scales. This framework allows us to consider in a very natural way the fusion of data from sensors with differing resolutions. In particular we present results on the fusion of noisy 1st-order Gauss-Markov processes which demonstrate the richness of our class of models in approximating processes. These results also show the ease with which this framework allows us to interpolate sparse, non-uniformly sampled fine data using coarser measurements with fuller coverage. lLaboratory for Information and Decision Systems and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,MA 02139, USA.

Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems.

The method is efficiently implementable on parallel architectures, and provides a unifying procedure for performing a hierarchical, multiscale, coarse-to-fine analysis of image-processing tasks such as restoration, texture analysis, coding, motion analysis, etc. The method is formulated and applied to the restoration of degraded images. The restoration algorithm is a global-optimization algorithm applicable to other optimization problems. It generates iteratively a multilevel cascode of restored images corresponding to different levels of resolution, or scale. In the lower levels of the cascade appear the large-scale features of the image, and in the higher levels, the microscopic features of the image. >"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

                "text": "may 7th, 1986, Professor A. F. M. Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

A cooperative, iterative approach to segmentation and property estimation is defined; the results of each process at a given iteration are used to adjust the other process at the next iteration. A linked pyramid structure provides a framework for this process iteration. This hierarchical structure ensures rapid convergence even with strictly local communication between pyramid nodes."

The combination of nonlinearities f(x)= mod x mod /sup alpha / (in particular, alpha =2) and g(x)=log x maximizes texture discrimination, and results in a description with variances approximately constant for all feature components and texture regions.

An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72% were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65% with augmented correlation statistics, and 94% with texture energy statistics."

At high temperature, the behavior of the algorithm is similar to the stochastic ones. However, if the temperature is less than a certain threshold, it becomes deterministic. The length of the pseudo-stochastic phase is controlled by a constant threshold used in the modified dynamics. The algorithm yields an approximate but usually good solution to the optimization problem. The algorithm runs on a connection machine.

Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate.

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."

The recently introduced wavelet transforms provide a time-and-scale decomposition of signals that offers the possibility of such analysis. A corresponding statistical framework to support the development of optimal, multiscale statistical signal processing algorithms is described. The theory of multiscale signal representation leads naturally to models of signals on trees, and this provides the framework for investigation. In particular, the class of isotropic processes on homogeneous trees is described, and a theory of autoregressive models is developed in this context. This leads to generalizations of Schur and Levinson recursions, associated properties of the resulting reflection coefficients, and the initial pieces in a system theory for multiscale modeling. >"

                "text": "of the number of bits required to write down the observed data, has been reformulated to extend the classical maximum likelihood principle. The principle permits estimation of the number of the parameters in statistical models in addition to their values and even of the way the parameters appear in the models; i.e., of the model structures. The principle rests on a new way to interpret and construct a universal prior distribution for the integers, which makes sense even when the parameter is an individual object. Truncated realvalued parameters are converted to integers by dividing them by their precision, and their prior is determined from the universal prior for the integers by optimizing the precision. 1. Introduction. In this paper we study estimation based upon the principle of minimizing the total number of binary digits required to rewrite the observed data, when each observation is given with some precision. Instead of attempting at an absolutely shortest description, which would be futile, we look for the optimum relative to a class of parametrically given distributions. This Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which we introduced in a less comprehensive form in [25], turns out to degenerate to the more familiar Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle in case the number of parameters in the models is fixed, so that the description length of the parameters themselves can be ignored. In another extreme case, where the parameters determine the data, it similarly degenerates to Jaynes's principle of maximum entropy, [14]. But the main power of the new criterion is that it permits estimates of the entire model, its parameters, their number, and even the way the parameters appear in the model; i.e., the model structure. Hence, there will be no need to supplement the estimated parameters with a separate hypothesis test to decide whether a model is adequately parameterized or, perhaps, over parameterized."

The Gibbs\u2014Markov equivalence theorem (Preston 1974) parameterizes Markov fields via their neighborhood structures, yielding exponential families in canonical form. Likelihood inference is, therefore, apparently straightforward. The requisite normalizing constants, however, are obstreperous. Even when asymptotic characterizations can be obtained, substantial location errors arise during implementation. Moreover, Markov fields can exhibit phase transitions and long-range interactions, thereby creating identifiability problems. These issues are illustrated in the simplest nontrivial case\u2014the classical Ising model of ferromagnetism."

The product of a unique collaboration among four leading scientists in academic research and industry, Numerical Recipes is a complete text and reference book on scientific computing. In a self-contained manner it proceeds from mathematical and theoretical considerations to actual practical computer routines. With over 100 new routines (now well over 300 in all), plus upgraded versions of many of the original routines, this book is more than ever the most practical, comprehensive handbook of scientific computing available today. The book retains the informal, easy-to-read style that made the first edition so popular, with many new topics presented at the same accessible level. In addition, some sections of more advanced material have been introduced, set off in small type from the main body of the text. Numerical Recipes is an ideal textbook for scientists and engineers and an indispensable reference for anyone who works in scientific computing. Highlights of the new material include a new chapter on integral equations and inverse methods; multigrid methods for solving partial differential equations; improved random number routines; wavelet transforms; the statistical bootstrap method; a new chapter on \"less-numerical\" algorithms including compression coding and arbitrary precision arithmetic; band diagonal linear systems; linear algebra on sparse matrices; Cholesky and QR decomposition; calculation of numerical derivatives; Pade approximants, and rational Chebyshev approximation; new special functions; Monte Carlo integration in high-dimensional spaces; globally convergent methods for sets of nonlinear equations; an expanded chapter on fast Fourier methods; spectral analysis on unevenly sampled data; Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters; and two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests. All this is in addition to material on such basic top"

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

After spatial and temporal neighbors are defined, a general form of maximum a posterior spatiotemporal contextual classifier is derived.

The classification is performed in a recursive manner to allow a computationally efficient contextual classification. Experimental results with bitemporal TM data show significant improvement of classification accuracy over noncontextual pixelwise classifiers. This spatiotemporal contextual classifier should find use in many applications of remote sensing, especially when the classification accuracy is important. >"

This report outlines standard methods for collecting and maintaining a permanent LCTA data base on the condition of Army land resources. Included are lists of equipment needed for data collection, and detailed procedures for establishing permanent field plots, collecting plant specimens, inventorying wildlife populations, and maintaining the data bases by periodic short- and long-term monitoring of the field plots."
