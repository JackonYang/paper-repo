                "text": "Abstract In this article, we present a comprehensive study aimed at computing semantic relatedness of word pairs. We analyze the performance of a large number of semantic relatedness measures proposed in the literature with respect to different experimental conditions, such as (i) the datasets employed, (ii) the language (English or German), (iii) the underlying knowledge source, and (iv) the evaluation task (computing scores of semantic relatedness, ranking word pairs, solving word choice problems). To our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically analyze semantic relatedness on a large number of datasets with different properties, while emphasizing the role of the knowledge source compiled either by the \u2018wisdom of linguists\u2019 (i.e., classical wordnets) or by the \u2018wisdom of crowds\u2019 (i.e., collaboratively constructed knowledge sources like Wikipedia). The article discusses benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to evaluating semantic relatedness. We show that results should be interpreted carefully to evaluate particular aspects of semantic relatedness. For the first time, we employ a vector based measure of semantic relatedness, relying on a concept space built from documents, to the first paragraph of Wikipedia articles, to English WordNet glosses, and to GermaNet based pseudo glosses. Contrary to previous research (Strube and Ponzetto 2006; Gabrilovich and Markovitch 2007; Zesch et al. 2007), we find that \u2018wisdom of crowds\u2019 based resources are not superior to \u2018wisdom of linguists\u2019 based resources. We also find that using the first paragraph of a Wikipedia article as opposed to the whole article leads to better precision, but decreases recall. Finally, we present two systems that were developed to aid the experiments presented herein and are freely available1 for research purposes: (i) DEXTRACT, a software to semi-automatically construct corpus-driven semantic relatedness datasets, and (ii) JWPL, a Java-based high-performance Wikipedia Application Programming Interface (API) for building natural language processing (NLP) applications."

                "text": "Ontology, as an effective approach to bridge the semantic gap in various domains, has attracted a lot of interests from multimedia researchers. Among the numerous possibilities enabled by ontology, we are particularly interested in exploiting ontology for a better understanding of media task (particularly, images) on the World Wide Web.\n To achieve our goal, two open issues are inevitably involved: 1) How to avoid the tedious manual work for ontology construction? 2) What are the effective inference models when using an ontology? Recent works[11, 16] about ontology learned from Wikipedia has been reported in conferences targeting the areas of knowledge management and artificial intelligent. There are also reports of different inference models being investigated [5, 13, 15]. However, so far there has not been any comprehensive solution.\n In this paper, we look at these challenges and attempt to provide a general solution to both questions. Through a careful analysis of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia's categorization and page content, we choose it as our knowledge source and propose an automatic ontology construction approach. We prove that it is a viable way to build ontology under various domains. To address the inference model issue, we provide a novel understanding of the ontology and consider it as a type of semantic network, which is similar to brain models in the cognitive research field. Spreading Activation Techniques, which have been proved to be a correct information processing model in the semantic network, are consequently introduced for inference. We have implemented a prototype system with the developed solutions for web image retrieval. By comprehensive experiments on the canine category of the animal kingdom, we show that this is a scalable architecture for our proposed methods."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

In this paper we present a new semantic similarity metric that exploits some notions of the early work done using a feature based theory of similarity, and translates it into the information theoretic domain which leverages the notion of Information Content (IC). In particular, the proposed metric exploits the notion of intrinsic IC which quantifies IC values by scrutinizing how concepts are arranged in an ontological structure. In order to evaluate this metric, we conducted an on line experiment asking the community of researchers to rank a list of 65 word pairs. The experiment's web setup allowed to collect 101 similarity ratings, and to differentiate native and non-native English speakers. Such a large and diverse dataset enables to confidently evaluate similarity metrics by correlating them with human assessments. Experimental evaluations using WordNet indicate that our metric, coupled with the notion of intrinsic IC, yields results above the state of the art. Moreover, the intrinsic IC formulation also improves the accuracy of other IC based metrics. We implemented our metric and several others in the Java WordNet Similarity Library."

We use machine learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as a weighted vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments: from r = 0.56 to 0.75 for individual words and from r = 0.60 to 0.72 for texts. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

We use the semantics of image labels to integrate prior knowledge about inter-class relationships into the visual appearance learning. We show how to build and train a semantic hierarchy of discriminative classifiers and how to use it to perform object detection. We evaluate how our approach influences the classification accuracy and speed on the Pascal VOC challenge 2006 dataset, a set of challenging real-world images. We also demonstrate additional features that become available to object recognition due to the extension with semantic inference tools- we can classify high-level categories, such as animals, and we can train part detectors, for example a window detector, by pure inference in the semantic network."

Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overfitting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classifier could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, define a nearest neighbor classifier where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classification might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classification task."

Transferring knowledge from such models to new object classes trained from a few or even as little as one training instance however is still in its infancy. This paper designs a shape-based model that allows to easily and explicitly transfer knowledge on three different levels: transfer of individual parts' shape and appearance information, transfer of local symmetry between parts, and transfer of part topology. Due to the factorized form of the model, knowledge can either be transferred for the complete model or just partial knowledge corresponding to certain aspects of the model. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the state-of-the-art and enables both full and partial knowledge transfer."

This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classification using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overfitting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classifier could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, define a nearest neighbor classifier where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classification might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classification task."

We first observed an interesting computational property of the object hierarchy: comparing the recognition rate when using models of objects at different levels, the higher more inclusive levels (e.g., closed-frame vehicles or vehicles) exhibit higher recall but lower precision when compared with the class specific level (e.g., bus). These inherent differences suggest that combining object classifiers from different hierarchical levels into a single classifier may improve classification, as it appears like these models capture different aspects of the object. We describe a method to combine these classifiers, and analyze the conditions under which improvement can be guaranteed. When given a small sample of a new object class, we describe a method to transfer knowledge across the tree hierarchy, between related objects. Finally, we describe extensive experiments using object hierarchies obtained from publicly available datasets, and show that the combined classifiers significantly improve recognition results."

We present here an approach t o t is problem that merges recognition of an object and its backgro und. Relying on the assumption that given objects are strong ly linked to given background scenes (a deer is more likely to appear in a f orest than on an iceberg), we learn object classifiers using j o t estimations of object and scene. Such an approach would normally require a large quantity of training images labelled with object/ba ckground scene associations. To circumvent costly manual training s et labelling, we propose a cross-modal approach, learning a nd incorporating contextual information via automatic text analysis from th e Web, to generate the conditional probabilities of an objec t given a background scene. This method allows us to strictly distinguish the obj ect classifier from the background scene classifier, and then merge them using estimated conditional probabilities through a learned Bay esian network. The key contribution of this paper is a framew ork that provides a unified, multimodal approach to learning and using context ual information for improving image processing using stati tics obtained from processing Web text."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

In this method, a novel class is characterized by its similarity to a number of previously learned, familiar classes. We demonstrate that this similarity is well-preserved across different class instances. As a result, it generalizes well to new instances of the novel class. A simple comparison of the similarity patterns is therefore sufficient to obtain useful classification performance from a single training example. The similarity between the novel class and the familiar classes in the proposed method can be evaluated using a wide variety of existing classification schemes. It can therefore combine the merits of many different classification methods. Experiments on a database of 107 widely varying object classes demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the baseline algorithm."

However these techniques mostly rely on low-level descriptors similarity between different items and when one uses such an application to find pictures, the proposed answers are often not conceptually similar to the query. In this paper, we describe RetrievOnto, an image retrieval (IR) system that allies CBIR techniques and semantics in order to better fit the users' expectations when querying an image database. The dataset is structured employing a term hierarchy, which is used to control the conceptual neighbourhood where similar items are searched. Only the leaf terms of the hierarchy have associated image sets but, with the use of the type-subtype relation between nodes, pictures are indirectly associated to all the concepts in the hierarchy and the system can propose localized IR processes, which associate low-level and conceptual similarities (on different levels of generality). We model a real-world situation by using pictures gathered from the Internet. The ontologically controlled IR method proposed in this paper is compared to classical CBIR functioning and we show that the introduction of a hierarchical structure improves precision results for the system."

We assume images are labeled with category, but not location, of an instance. We estimate models with an iterative procedure: the current model is used to produce a saliency score, which, together with a homogeneity cue, identifies likely locations for the object (resp. attribute); then those locations are used to produce better models with multiple instance learning. Crucially, the object and attribute models must agree on the potential locations of an object. This means that the more accurate of the two models can guide the improvement of the less accurate model. Our method is evaluated on two data sets of images of real scenes, one in which the attribute is color and the other in which it is material. We show that our joint learning produces improved detectors. We demonstrate generalization by detecting attribute-object pairs which do not appear in our training data. The iteration gives significant improvement in performance."

To our knowledge, this is the first model that performs all three tasks in one coherent framework. For instance, a scene of a `polo game' consists of several visual objects such as `human', `horse', `grass', etc. In addition, it can be further annotated with a list of more abstract (e.g. `dusk') or visually less salient (e.g. `saddle') tags. Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes. In all three tasks, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

In this method, experience with already learned classes is used to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Our classification scheme employs features that discriminate between class and non-class images. For a novel class, new features are derived by selecting features that proved useful for already learned classification tasks, and adapting these features to the new classification task. This adaptation is performed by replacing the features from already learned classes with similar features taken from the novel class. A single example of a novel class is sufficient to perform feature adaptation and achieve useful classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can learn a novel class from a single training example, using 10 additional familiar classes. The performance is significantly improved compared to using no feature adaptation. The robustness of the proposed feature adaptation concept is demonstrated by similar performance gains across 107 widely varying object categories."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."

Our first method - \u201cattribute\u201d classifiers - uses binary classifiers trained to recognize the presence or absence of describable aspects of visual appearance (e.g., gender, race, and age). Our second method - \u201csimile\u201d classifiers - removes the manual labeling required for attribute classification and instead learns the similarity of faces, or regions of faces, to specific reference people. Neither method requires costly, often brittle, alignment between image pairs; yet, both methods produce compact visual descriptions, and work on real-world images. Furthermore, both the attribute and simile classifiers improve on the current state-of-the-art for the LFW data set, reducing the error rates compared to the current best by 23.92% and 26.34%, respectively, and 31.68% when combined. For further testing across pose, illumination, and expression, we introduce a new data set - termed PubFig - of real-world images of public figures (celebrities and politicians) acquired from the internet. This data set is both larger (60,000 images) and deeper (300 images per individual) than existing data sets of its kind. Finally, we present an evaluation of human performance."
