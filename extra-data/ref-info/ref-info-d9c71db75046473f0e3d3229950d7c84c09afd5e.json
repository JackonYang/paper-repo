The method learns a series of symbolic transformational rules, which can then be applied in sequence to a test corpus to produce predictions. The learning process only requires counting matches for a given set of rule templates, allowing the method to survey a very large space of possible contextual factors. This paper analyses Brill's approach as an interesting variation on existing decision tree methods, based on experiments involving part-of-speech tagging for both English and ancient Greek corpora. In particular, the analysis throws light on why the new mechanism seems surprisingly resistant to overtraining. A fast, incremental implementation and a mechanism for recording the dependencies that underlie the resulting rule sequence are also described."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

                "text": "A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Eric Brill Supervisor: Mitchell Marcus One goal of computational linguistics is to discover a method for assigning a rich structural annotation to sentences that are presented as simple linear strings of words; meaning can be much more readily extracted from a structurally annotated sentence than from a sentence with no structural information. Also, structure allows for a more in-depth check of the well-formedness of a sentence. There are two phases to assigning these structural annotations: rst, a knowledge base is created and second, an algorithm is used to generate a structural annotation for a sentence based upon the facts provided in the knowledge base. Until recently, most knowledge bases were created manually by language experts. These knowledge bases are expensive to create and have not been used e ectively in structurally parsing sentences from other than highly restricted domains. The goal of this dissertation is to make signi cant progress toward designing automata that are able to learn some structural aspects of human language with little human guidance. In particular, we describe a learning algorithm that takes a small structurally annotated corpus of text and a larger unannotated corpus as input, and automatically learns how to assign accurate structural descriptions to sentences not in the training corpus. The main tool we use to automatically discover structural information about language from corpora is transformation-based error-driven learning. The distribution of errors produced by an imperfect annotator is examined to learn an ordered list of transformations that can be applied to provide an accurate structural annotation. We demonstrate the application of this learning algorithm iv to part of speech tagging and parsing. Successfully applying this technique to create systems that learn could lead to robust, trainable and accurate natural language processing systems. v"

The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure. By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error. After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction."

The paper also discusses the notion of basic clause that was defined as the parsing target. The result of a comparison of the error rates of the two parsing methods in the recognition of basic clauses showed that there was a 13% error rate for the regular expression method and a 6.5% error rate for the stochastic method."

This system first uses heuristics to find \u201cmaximal length noun phrases\u201d, and then uses a grammar to extract \u201cterminological units.\u201d For example, from the maximal NP le disque dur de la station de travail it extracts the two terminological phrases disque dur, and station de travail. Bourigault claims that the grammar can parse \u201caround 95% of the maximal length noun phrases\u201d in a test corpus into possible terminological phrases, which then require manual validation. However, because its goal is terminological phrases, it appears that this system ignores NP chunk-initial determiners and other initial prenominal modifiers, somewhat simplifying the parsing task. Voutilainen (1993), in his impressive NPtool system, uses an approach that is in some ways similar to the one used here, in that he adds to his part-of-speech tags a new kind of tag that shows chunk structure; the chunk tag \u201c@>N\u201d, for example, is used for determiners and premodifiers, both of which group with the following noun head."

A corpus of French language texts on any subject field is fed in, and LEXTER produces a list of likely terminological units to be submitted to an expert to be validated. To identify the terminological units, LEXTER takes their form into account and proceeds in two main stages: analysis, parsing. In the first stage, LEXTER uses a base of rules designed to indentify frontier markers in view to analysing the texts and extracting maximal-length noun phrases. In the second stage, LEXTER parses these maximal-length noun phrases to extract subgroups which by virtue of their grammatical structure and their place in the maximal-length noun phrases are likely to be terminological units. In this article, the type of analysis used (surface grammatical analysis) is highlighted, as the methodological approach adopted to adapt the rules (experimental approach)."

It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks."
