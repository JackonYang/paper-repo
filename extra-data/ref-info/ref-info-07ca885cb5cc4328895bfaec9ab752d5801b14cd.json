Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

However, training the neural network model with the maximum-likelihood criterion requires computations proportional to the number of words in the vocabulary. In this paper, we introduce adaptive importance sampling as a way to accelerate training of the model. The idea is to use an adaptive n-gram model to track the conditional distributions produced by the neural network. We show that a very significant speedup can be obtained on standard problems."

In contrast to the well known back-off n-gram language models, the neural network approach attempts to overcome the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space. This type of language model was mostly used for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available.In this paper we present new algorithms to train a neural network language model on very large text corpora. This makes possible the use of the approach in domains where several hundreds of millions words of texts are available. The neural network language model is evaluated in a state-of-the-art real-time continuous speech recognizer for French Broadcast News. Word error reductions of 0.5% absolute are reported using only a very limited amount of additional processing time."

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling."

However, it faces the data sparseness problem because of the large dimensionality and diversity of the information available in the syntactic parsing. Previously, we proposed using neural network models for the SLM (Emami, A. et al., Proc. ICASSP, 2003; Emami, Proc. EUROSPEECH'03., 2003). The neural network model is better suited to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. We present a new method of training the neural net based SLM. This procedure makes use of the partial parsing hypothesized by the SLM itself, and is more expensive than the approximate training method used previously. Experiments with the new training method on the UPenn and WSJ corpora show significant reductions in perplexity and word error rate, achieving the lowest published results for the given corpora."

The neural probabilistic model makes use of a distributed representation of the items in the conditioning history, and is powerful in capturing long dependencies. Employing neural network based models in the syntactic based language model enables it to use efficiently the large amount of information available in a syntactic parse in estimating the next word in a string. Several scenarios of integrating neural networks in the syntactic based language model are presented, accompanied by the derivation of the training procedures involved. Experiments on the UPenn Treebank and the Wall Street Journal corpus show significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. Furthermore, comparisons with the standard and neural net based N-gram models with arbitrarily long contexts show that the syntactic information is in fact very helpful in estimating the word string probability. Overall, our neural syntactic based model achieves the best published results in perplexity and WER for the given data sets."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Relative reductions in word error rate are more than 15% over baseline obtained with adapted 4-gram backoff language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing."

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."
