It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

But early experience can grossly modify the visual cortex. Blakemore and Cooper2 reared two kittens in the dark except for a few hours each day spent in cylindrical chambers painted with black and white stripes at one orientation. These two animals, which experienced almost 300 h of exposure to stripes during their first 5 months of life, had no cortical neurones responding to the orientation perpendicular to the stripes that they saw when they were young. Almost all their cortical cells preferred orientations within 45 deg of the experienced angle. The phenomenon involves active modification of the receptive fields of the neurones, and not mere degeneration of unused cells, because there were no regions of silent cortex and no histological evidence of degeneration."

This suggests that the anatomical connections between retina and striate cortex are for the most part innate. During the first 3 months of life the connections are highly susceptible to the effects of visual deprivation, to the extent that exclusion of all form and some light from one eye leads to a severe decline in the ability of that eye to influence cortical cells. Anatomical and physiological evidence suggests that the defect is chiefly, though not entirely, a cortical one (7-9). The object of the present study was to influence cortical connections by some means less drastic than covering one or both eyes. We wished if possible to alter the input in such a way that there would be no question of effects on the visual pathway below the level of the striate cortex. A method was suggested by the well-known clinical observation that a child with a squint (strabismus or nonparallel visual axes) may suffer a deterioration of vision in one eye (amblyopia ex anopsia). Since the visual pathways from the two eyes are for practical purposes separate up to the level of the striate cortex, it is unlikely that in these children the defect is in the retina or geniculate. An artificial squint therefore seemed to provide a possible means of obtaining a cortical defect while sparing the retina and lateral geniculate body. Accordingly , we produced a divergent strabismus by cutting one of the extraocular muscles in each of four newborn kittens, with the plan of testing vision and recording from single cortical cells after several months to a year. When at length each eye was tested in these kittens by observing the ani-mal's behavior with the other eye covered the results were disappointing: there was not the slightest suggestion of any defect in vision in either eye. This was not entirely unexpected, since with both eyes uncovered the animals had appeared to fix at times with one eye and at times with the other. At this stage there seemed to be little point in proceeding further, for there- ."

Although the primary physical variables in the model are the membrane potentials of neurons, the equations which govern the means and covariances of the membrane potentials are coupled through the average firing rates; as a consequence, the average firing rates control the selective storage and retrieval of covariance information. Motor learning in the cerebellar cortex is treated as a problem of covariance storage, and a prediction is made for the underlying synaptic plasticity: the change in synaptic strength between a parallel fiber and a Purkinje cell should be proportional to the covariance between discharges in the parallel fiber and the climbing fiber. Unlike previous proposals for synaptic plasticity, this prediction requires both facilitation and depression to occur (under different conditions) at the same synapse."

Kittens were dark\u2010reared until 4\u20106 weeks old, and then for another 4\u20107 weeks with various combinations of cylindrical lenses, monocular occlusion, and normal vision. 2. Single unit recordings from 816 neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) were obtained after the end of exposure. Clear\u2010cut effects on the distributions of the neurones' ocular dominance and orientation preference were found yielding close correlations with the rearing conditions. 3. It was confirmed that most cortical neurones prefer vertical stimulus orientations when experience is restricted to vertical contours in both eyes. It was further confirmed that, if the experienced orientations are different in the two eyes, each eye dominates over those neurones whose orientation preference corresponds to the orientation this eye has experienced. 4. When one eye is covered while the other sees only contours of one orientation, the ocular dominance distribution of cortical neurones shows a bias towards the open eye. Neurones dominated by this eye prefer orientations corresponding to the experienced range. Neurones preferring other orientations are shared between both eyes. 5. When vision is unimpaired in one eye and restricted to vertical contours in the other, binocularity is common among neurones preferring vertical orientations. Neurones with orientation preferences off the vertical are mainly monocular and dominated by the eye with unrestricted vision. 6. When normal monocular vision of one eye precedes restricted monocular vision of the other eye, only a few binocular units are encountered. Reversal of the initial effects of monocular experience is found only in neurones preferring the orientation that has been experienced by the newly opened eye. The other neurones remain dominated by the originally open eye. Thus, complementary distributions of orientation preferences are found for the two eyes. 7. A good correlation was found between the amount of orientational experience as determined by the number of orientations exposed and the number of normally tuned neurones. Conversely, the number of neurones responding to all orientations decreases with increasing amount of experience."

                "text": "1. The iontophoretic application of the GABA antagonist bicuculline to simple and complex cells in the striate cortex of the cat produced extensive modifications of receptive field properties. These modifications appear to relate to a block or reduction of GABA\u2010mediated intracortical inhibitory influences acting on the cells examined. 2. For simple cells the effects of bicuculline on receptive field properties involved a loss of the subdivision of the receptive field into antagonistic \"on\" and \"off\" regions, a reduction in orientation specificity and a reduction or elimination of directional specificity. 3. The effect on the \"on\" and \"off\" subdivisions of the simple cell receptive field was such that all stationary flashing stimuli, whether covering the whole receptive field, or located within the receptive field over a previously determined \"on\" or \"off\" region, resulted in an \"on and off\" response. 4. The orientation specificity of complex cells was reduced during the application of bicuculline such that in many cases the original specificity of the cell was virtually lost with the response to the orientation at 90 degrees to the optimal being of similar magnitude to the optimal. The directional specificity of complex cells was generally less affected than that of simple cells. Often when large changes in orientation specificity were observed the directional specificity was relatively unaffected. 5. For some cells apparently showing to all visual stimuli only inhibitory responses, the application of bicuculline resulted in the appearance of excitatory responses. 6. In all cases receptive field properties reverted to the original state after termination of the bicuculline application. It was not generally possible to duplicate the effects of bicuculline by raising neuronal excitability with iontophoretically applied glutamate. 7. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the normal subdivision of the simple cell receptive field into separate \"on\" and \"off\" regions and its directional specificity are dependent on intracortical inhibitory processes that are blocked by bicuculline. The orientational tuning of simple cells conversely appears to be largely determined by the excitatory input but normally enhanced by lateral type inhibitory processes acting in the orientation domain. 8. It also appears that the excitatory input to some complex cells is not orientation specific. This suggests that for these cells it is extremely unlikely that they receive an orientation specific excitatory input from simple cells."

These results were pooled with a previous study of 582 units recorded from thirty\u2010five kittens reared in similar conditions. 2. These 1117 cells were classified into four functional classes of neurones: (a) visually unresponsive cells, (b) non\u2010specific cells which were sensitive to spots or slits of light moving in any direction, (c) immature cells which were preferentially activated by a rectilinear stimulus but unselective regarding its precise orientation and (d) specific cells that appeared to be as selective for orientation as the simple or complex cells in the adult cat. 3. The results confirm that cells having the same orientation\u2010specific response properties as adult cortical visual neurones are present in the earliest stages of post\u2010natal development, independently of visual experience. However, to maintain and develop these specific cells after the third week of post\u2010natal life, visual experience is necessary. 4. The ocular dominance of visual cells is not constant from the earliest stages of development. A significant increase in binocularly driven neurones occurs with age. 5. Before 3 weeks of age, whatever the rearing conditions, there are more specific cells coding horizontal and vertical orientations than those coding oblique orientations. These 'horizontal and vertical detectors' are preferentially driven by the contralateral eye. 5. After 4 weeks of age, specific neurones are found at all orientations in normally reared kittens. At this stage of development the ocular dominance is independent of orientation preference, of the functional class of neurones considered and of the rearing conditions. The proportion of binocularly driven cells is slightly below adult standard. 7. A hypothesis of differential plasticity is proposed: contralateral, monocular 'horizontal and vertical detectors' are supposed to be stable; they would remain so until they become binocular. Binocular cells, for which competition between two inputs occurs, are the labile units which can be despecified or specified under the control of visual experience."

                "text": "1. The early visual experience of nine cats was restricted to viewing horizontal or vertical lines inside opaque goggles. 2. When the kittens were 3-4 mo old, extracellular recordings were made in the primary visual cortex. To obtain a representative sample of cortical cells, units were studied at regularly spaced intervals along the course of electrode penetrations traveling oblique to the cortical surface. An automated assessment of preferred orientation using a computer-driven optical display was employed, and during the recording session the experimenters did not know which orientation(s) each animal had viewed in early life. 3. In the cats that viewed horizontal lines with one eye and vertical lines with the other during rearing, two major findings of previous workers (14) were confirmed. First, a majority of units were not selective for orientation. Second, units with preferred orientations near vertical tended to be activated exclusively by the eye that had viewed vertical, and likewise for horizontal. 4. In cats that viewed lines of the same orientation with both eyes during rearing, a substantially smaller proportion of units were selective for orientation; the preferred orientations of these units also tended to match the orientation to which the cats had been exposed. 5. Portions of some electrode penetrations showed an orderly arrangement of cells according to preferred orientation similar to that seen in normal cats, but with regions over which only nonselective cells were found. Many penetrations appeared less orderly. 6. The results are consistent with a role for early visual experience in maintaining the responsiveness and innate selectivity of cortical neurons, although they cannot entirely rule out the possibility that experience may alter or determine the preferred orientation of some cells."

The physiological mechanism proposed here for this process posits that at synapses acting according to Hebb's postulate, the receptors for the neurotransmitter are eliminated from the postsynaptic membrane by the transient reversals of the sign of membrane polarization that occur during action potential impulses in the postsynaptic cell. But, since the release of neurotransmitter drives the membrane potential of the synaptic zone towards a level about half-way between the negative-inside resting potential and the positive-inside action potential, it would follow that the membrane patches surrounding the receptors of a synapse whose activity has contributed to setting off the postsynaptic impulse would be spared the full extent of the noxious polarity reversal. This mechanism can account for a neurophysiologically documented example of the operation of Hebb's postulate, namely the plasticity of the connections between fourth- and fifth-order neurons in the visual cortex of cats."

                "text": "1. We studied the receptive fields of 171 striate cortical neurons from 17 cats raised with binocular lid suture. Of these, 102 fields were within 10 degrees of the area centralis and the remaining 69 were at least 38 degrees from the vertical meridian. 2. Based on their different response properties, cells were divided into three broad groups: the mappable cells (49%) had clearly defined receptive fields, the unmappable cells (31%) were activated by visual stimuli but had diffuse fields which could not be hand plotted, and the visually inexcitable cells (20%) could not be activated by visual stimuli. Very few (less than or equal to 12% of the total sample) normal simple or complex cells could be found. 3. Orientation selectivity was assessed in these cells. Only 12% displayed orientation selectivity within normal bounds, and these were all mappable cells. None of the unmappable cells had discernible orientation selectivity. 4. Ocular dominance was assessed for 62 of the centrally located receptive fields. Among mappable cells, there was an abnormally low proportion of binocular fields, while no such abnormality was seen for unmappable cells. 5. For 47 of the neurons, average response histograms were compiled for moving stimuli of various parameters in an effort to evoke the maximum discharge or peak response. This peak response was normal for mappable cells but reduced for unmappable cells. 6. We devised a technique for studying potential inhibitory receptive-field zones in these neurons, validated the method in normal striate cortex, and used it to test 20 mappable cells in the lid-sutured cats. None showed the pattern of strong inhibitory side bands seen in normal simple cells, although six showed weak or abnormal inhibitory zones. Interestingly, six of the seven visually inexcitable cells tested by this method had purely inhibitory receptive fields. 7. The effects of binocular suture were essentially identical for the binocular and monocular segments since the cell types and their response properties did not differ between these two areas of cortex. Furthermore, the cortical monocular segments of these cats seemed qualitatively different from the deprived cortical monocular segment after monocular suture. This extends an analogous difference for these cats reported for the monocular segments of the lateral geniculate nucleus. We thus conclude that monocularly and binocularly sutured cats develop by qualitatively different mechanisms. For the former, competition between central synapses related to each eye is a prominent feature of geniculocortical development, whereas, for the latter, such specific forms of geniculocortical development may not obtain."

Four classes of neurones were defined: (a) non\u2010activable cells that cannot be excited by any peripheral stimulation; (b) non\u2010specific cells that are sensitive to a visual stimulus moving in any direction; (c) immature cells that are preferentially excited by a rectilinear stimulus but are unselective for its precise orientation; (d) specific cells that appear to be as selective for orientation as the simple or complex cells of the adult cat. 3. 23% of the cells presenting adult characteristics of specificity in terms of directionality and orientation are present in both the normally reared and in the dark reared kittens as soon as the first visual response (12 days) appears. 4. In normally reared kittens the proportion of specific cells increases with age, while that of the non\u2010specific cells decreases. 5. Up to 3 weeks of age there is no significant difference in the proportion of the different types of cells in the dark reared from the normal kittens. But thereafter in the dark reared kittens the specific cells tend to disappear while the non\u2010specific cells increase in number. 6. This confirms the view that cells with some highly specific response properties of the adult visual cortical neurones, especially in relation to orientation specificity, are present in the earliest stages in the absence of all visual experience. However, visual experience is necessary to maintain and develop these specific cells after the third week of post\u2010natal life."

Their deprived eyes were then opened, and their experienced eyes shut for a further 3\u201063 days. After this time physiological recordings were made in the visual cortex, area 17. Three control kittens, monocularly deprived for various periods, showed that at the time of reverse\u2010suturing, few neurones could be influenced at all from the deprived eye. 2. Following reverse\u2010suturing, the initially deprived eye regained control of cortical neurones. This switch of cortical ocular dominance was most rapid following reverse\u2010suturing at the age of 4 weeks. Delaying the age of reverse\u2010suturing reduced the rate and then the extent of the cortical ocular dominance changes. 3. The cortex of reverse\u2010sutured kittens is divided into regions of cells dominated by one eye or the other. The relative sizes of these ocular dominance columns changed during reversed deprivation. The columns devoted to the initially deprived eye were very small in animals reverse\u2010sutured for brief periods, but in animals that underwent longer periods of reversed deprivation, the columns driven by that eye were larger, while those devoted to the initially open eye were smaller. 4. Clear progressions of orientation columns across the cortex were apparent in many of the kittens, but, in contrast to the situation in normal or strabismic kittens, these sequences were disrupted at the borders of eye dominance columns: the cortical representations of orientation and ocular dominance were not independent. 5. Binocular units in these kittens were rather rare, but those that could be found often had dissimilar receptive field properties in the two eyes. Commonly, a cell would have a normal orientation selective receptive field in one eye, and an immature, unselective receptive field in the other. Cells that had orientation selective receptive fields in both eyes often had greatly differing orientation preferences in the two eyes, occasionally by nearly 90 degrees. 6. During the reversal of deprivation effects, the proportion of receptive fields exhibiting mature properties declined in the initially experienced eye, while the proportion increased in the initially deprived eye. Similarly, the average band width of orientation tuning of receptive fields in the initially deprived eye decreased, while that of receptive fields in the initially experienced eye increased. 7. One kitten was reverse\u2010sutured twice, to demonstrate that cortical ocular dominance may be reversed a second time, even after one reversal of ocular dominance. 8. It is suggested that the sensitive period for cortical binocular development consists of two phases. In the first phase, all cortical neurones may be modified by experience, but the rate at which they may be modified decreases with age. In the second phase, an increasing number of cortical neurones becomes fixed in their properties, while those that remain modifiable are as modifiable as they were at the end of the first phase. 9..."

The visual cortices of all catecholamine\u2010depleted kittens showed high proportions of binocular neurons, in contrast to the control group, a majority of whose visual cortical neurons were driven exclusively by the non\u2010deprived eye. Preservation of binocularity in 6\u2010OHDA\u2010treated kittens was dose\u2010related. Even after a 1 to 2\u2010week period of lidsuture which reduced binocularity to 20% in controls, normal proportions of binocular neurons (>75%) were preserved if the cumulative dose had been 10 mg 6\u2010OHDA or more. The density of single neurons sampled from electrode tracks through the cortex of drug\u2010treated kittens was high and did not differ significantly from controls. Neurons were isolated every 100 \u03bcm on the average. There was some indication that the drug's effect in preventing an ocular dominance shift disappears by six weeks following cessation of 6\u2010OHDA treatment. This reversal of the physiological effects in cortex is preceded by recovery from the behavioral manifestations of 6\u2010OHDA treatments. Binocularity was only slightly increased in a kitten who received large doses of 6\u2010OHDA after a period of monocular deprivation. This observation, together with control recordings from normal kittens and adults treated with 6\u2010OHDA, indicates that the direct effects of 6\u2010OHDA on cortical neurons' response properties play a minor role in comparison to its effects in reducing the sensitivity of the cortex to monocular deprivation. The overwhelming majority of cortical neurons in 6\u2010OHDA\u2010treated kittens remained normal in receptive field properties after a period of monocular deprivation. These data support the hypothesis that catecholamines are required for the maintenance of visual cortical plasticity during the critical period."

(1978). On the other hand, local information available at each modifiable synapse can influence each junction in a different manner. In this paper, we are interested primarily in the effect of local information on the development of selectivity. An early proposal as to how local information could affect synaptic modification was made by Hebb (1949). His, now classical, principle was suggested as a possible neurophysiological basis for operant conditioning: \u201cwhen an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A\u2019s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased."
