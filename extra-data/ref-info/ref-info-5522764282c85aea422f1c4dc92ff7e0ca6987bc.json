End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score."

Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of RNNs in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel LSTM based RNN architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare LSTM, RNN and DNN models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

                "text": "This paper addresses the problem of learning t\u00f2divide and conquer' by meaningful hierarchical adaptive decomposition of temporal sequences. This problem is relevant for time-series analysis as well as for goal-directed learning, particularily if event sequences tend to have hierarchical temporal structure. The rst neural systems for recursively chunking sequences are described. These systems are based on a principle called th\u00e8principle of history compression'. This principle essentially says: As long as a predictor is able to predict future environmental inputs from previous ones, no additional knowledge can be obtained by observing these inputs in reality. Only unexpected inputs deserve attention. A focus is on a class of 2-network systems which try to collapse a self-organizing (possibly multi-level) hierarchy of temporal predictors into a single recurrent network. Only those input events that were not expected by the rst recurrent net are transferred to the second recurrent net. Therefore the second net receives a reduced discription of the input history. It tries to develop internal representations for`higher-level' temporal structure. These internal representations in turn serve to create additional training signals for the rst net, thus helping the rst net to create longer and longer`chunks' for the second net. Experiments show that chunking systems can be superior to the conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets. 1 OUTLINE Section 2 motivates the search for sequence-composing systems by describing major drawbacks of`conventional' learning algorithms for recurrent networks with time-varying inputs and outputs. Section 3 describes a simple observation which is essential for the rest of this paper: It describes th\u00e8principle of history compression'. This principle essentially says: As long as a predictor is able to predict future environmental inputs from previous ones, no additional knowledge can be obtained by observing these inputs in reality. Only unexpected inputs deserve attention. This principle is of particular interest if typical event sequences have hierarchical temporal structure. Basic schemes for constructing sequence chunking systems based on the principle of history compression are described. Section 4 then describes on-line and o-line versions of a particular 2-network chunking system which tries to collapse a self-organizing (possibly multi-level) predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent network (the automatizer). The idea is to feed everything that is unexpected into a `higher-level' recurrent net (the chunker). Since the expected things can be derived from the unexpected things by the automatizer, the chunker is fed with a reduced description of the input history. The chunker has a \u2026"

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs."

We show that the long-term dependencies problem is lessened for a class of architectures called nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous (NARX) recurrent neural networks, which have powerful representational capabilities. We have previously reported that gradient descent learning can be more effective in NARX networks than in recurrent neural network architectures that have \"hidden states\" on problems including grammatical inference and nonlinear system identification. Typically, the network converges much faster and generalizes better than other networks. The results in this paper are consistent with this phenomenon. We present some experimental results which show that NARX networks can often retain information for two to three times as long as conventional recurrent neural networks. We show that although NARX networks do not circumvent the problem of long-term dependencies, they can greatly improve performance on long-term dependency problems. We also describe in detail some of the assumptions regarding what it means to latch information robustly and suggest possible ways to loosen these assumptions."

This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to divide and conquer by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multilevel hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multilevel predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that the system can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets."

The BRNN can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution.

Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard back propagation."

Sometimes, however, gradient information is of little use for training RNNs, due to numerous local minima. For such cases, we present a novel method: EVOlution of systems with LINear Outputs (Evolino). Evolino evolves weights to the nonlinear, hidden nodes of RNNs while computing optimal linear mappings from hidden state to output, using methods such as pseudo-inverse-based linear regression. If we instead use quadratic programming to maximize the margin, we obtain the first evolutionary recurrent support vector machines. We show that Evolino-based LSTM can solve tasks that Echo State nets (Jaeger, 2004a) cannot and achieves higher accuracy in certain continuous function generation tasks than conventional gradient descent RNNs, including gradient-based LSTM."

In this report, we partition the TIDIGITS database into utterances spoken by men, women, boys and girls, and successively retrain a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN on them. We find that the network rapidly adapts to new subsets of the data, and achieves greater accuracy than when trained on them from scratch. This would be useful for applications requiring either cross corpus adaptation or continually expanding datasets."

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens."

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. \n \nOur success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods."

The network adds higher orders when needed by adding new units that dynamically modify connection weights. Since the new units modify the weights at the next time-step with information from the previous step, temporal tasks can be learned without the use of feedback, thereby greatly simplifying training. Furthermore, a theoretically unlimited number of units can be added to reach into the arbitrarily distant past. Experiments with the Reber grammar have demonstrated speedups of two orders of magnitude over recurrent networks."

When these patterns arise from sequential data, the multiscale structure also contains a dynamic component that must be modelled, particularly, as is often the case, if the data is unsegmented. Probabilistic graphical models are the predominant framework for labelling unsegmented sequential data in structured domains. Their use requires a certain degree of a priori knowledge about the relations among patterns and about the patterns themselves. This paper presents a hierarchical system, based on the connectionist temporal classification algorithm, for labelling unsegmented sequential data at multiple scales with recurrent neural networks only. Experiments on the recognition of sequences of spoken digits show that the system outperforms hidden Markov models, while making fewer assumptions about the domain."

Most supervised gradient-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from a vanishing error signal that prevents learning from inputs far in the past. Those that do not, still have problems when there are numerous local minima. We introduce a general framework for sequence learning, EVOlution of recurrent systems with LINear outputs (Evolino). Evolino uses evolution to discover good RNN hidden node weights, while using methods such as linear regression or quadratic programming to compute optimal linear mappings from hidden state to output. Using the Long Short-Term Memory RNN Architecture, the method is tested in three very different problem domains: 1) context-sensitive languages, 2) multiple superimposed sine waves, and 3) the Mackey-Glass system. Evolino performs exceptionally well across all tasks, where other methods show notable deficiencies in some."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Since the EKF involves adjusting unit activity in the network, it also provides a principled generalization of the teacher forcing technique. Preliminary simulation experiments on simple finite-state Boolean tasks indicated that the EKF can provide substantial speed-up in number of time steps required for training on such problems when compared with simpler online gradient algorithms. The computational requirements of the EKF are steep, but scale with network size at the same rate as RTRL.<<ETX>>"

In most systems the two elements are handled separately, with sophisticated preprocessing techniques used to extract the image features and sequential models such as HMMs used to provide the transcriptions. By combining two recent innovations in neural networks\u2014multidimensional recurrent neural networks and connectionist temporal classification\u2014this paper introduces a globally trained offline handwriting recogniser that takes raw pixel data as input. Unlike competing systems, it does not require any alphabet specific preprocessing, and can therefore be used unchanged for any language. Evidence of its generality and power is provided by data from a recent international Arabic recognition competition, where it outperformed all entries (91.4% accuracy compared to 87.2% for the competition winner) despite the fact that neither author understands a word of Arabic."

An extension of this transition-table approach is described, using a recurrent autopredictive connectionist network called CONCERT. CONCERT is trained on a set of pieces with the aim of extracting stylistic regularities. CONCERT can then be used to compose new pieces. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the incorporation of psychologically grounded representations of pitch, duration and harmonic structure. CONCERT was tested on sets of examples artificially generated according to simple rules and was shown to learn the underlying structure, even where other approaches failed. In larger experiments, CONCERT was trained on sets of J. S. Bach pieces and traditional European folk melodies and was then allowed to compose novel melodies. Although the compositions are occasionally pleasant, and are..."

Automating this task could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients. Current solutions to this problem replay manually programmed trajectories, but a more general and robust approach is to use supervised machine learning to smooth surgeon-given training trajectories and generalize from them. Since knottying generally requires a controller with internal memory to distinguish between identical inputs that require different actions at different points along a trajectory, it would be impossible to teach the system using traditional feedforward neural nets or support vector machines. Instead we exploit more powerful, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with adaptive internal states. Results obtained using LSTM RNNs trained by the recent Evolino algorithm show that this approach can significantly increase the efficiency of suture knot tying in MIS over preprogrammed control"

Available cooperation mechanisms either use bilateral multi-step negotiation or auctioning. Negotiations encourage agents to reason about the interests of their opponents. Thus, negotiations suffer from counterspeculations. Auctions apply to asymmetric trading only; they either favor the auctioneer or the bidders. Both mechanisms do not promote agents to tell the truth. Therefore, we propose to use a trustbroker to mediate between the agents. We introduce three symmetric, negotiation free one-step protocols to carry out a sequence of decisions for agents with possibly conflicting interests. The protocols achieve substantially better overall benefit than random or hostile selection, and they avoid lies. We analyze the protocols with respect to informed vs. uninformed lies, and with respect to beneficial vs. malevolent lies, and show that agents are best off to know and announce their true interests. Analytical proofs and simulations substantiate our results."

                "text": "Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance."
