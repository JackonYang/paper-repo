The reciprocal nature of these spatio-temporal interactions can be particularly clearly ap\u00ad preciated if the threshold contrast is determined for a grating target whose luminance perpendicular to the bars is given by where m is the contrast, v the spatial frequency, and \u0192 the temporal frequency of the target.

The points are the means of four measurements and the curves (two with dashed low-frequency sections) differ only in their positions along the contrast-sensitivity scale, O 0.5 cycle per degree, \u25cf 4, \u2206 16, \u25b2 22 cycles per degree.

Such a pattern was set up as a display on a cathode-ray oscil\u00ad loscope and Figs. 1 and 2 show the results of threshold-contrast measurements made by the author (a well-corrected myope).

Evaluation of characteristics is limited to elements preceding the computer, and particularly to the \u201cluminance channel\u201d of the color system.The primary photoelectric transfer characteristics n\u00af1=f(Er) of the receptors (rods and cones) are computed as a function of retinal illumination (Er) from threshold signal-to-noise ratios in the effective image area of point sources, disks, and other test objects. The effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants, if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."
