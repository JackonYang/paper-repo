The central part of the algorithm is the establishment of correspondence between prototype template and image based on finding qualitative shape invariants in the form of order types of sets of points and lines. A central problem of any matching algorithm like this is the rejection of background and foreground clutter in the image resulting in erroneous matches. By deforming the prototype and iterating the computation of correspondence we reject outliers and improve the quality of the matching. Experimental results in terms of locating examples of specific object classes in real gray-level images are presented. The results demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm and make it an interesting candidate for any categorical recognition system such as database indexing."

This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model.

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

As such, this represents a new class of appearance based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the paper develops techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that these techniques can identify over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the techniques have low complexity and therefore run in real-time."

Each decision rule uses the statistics of both object appearance and \u201cnon-object\u201d visual appearance. We represent each set of statistics using a product of histograms. Each histogram represents the joint statistics of a subset of wavelet coefficients and their position on the object. Our approach is to use many such histograms representing a wide variety of visual attributes. Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect faces that vary from frontal view to full profile view and the first algorithm that can reliably detect cars over a wide range of viewpoints."

The shape context describes the coarse arrangement of the shape with respect to a point inside or on the boundary of the shape. We use the shape context as a vector-valued attribute in a bipartite graph matching framework. Our proposed method makes use of a relatively small number of sample points selected from the set of detected edges; no special landmarks or keypoints are necessary. Tolerance and/or invariance to common image transformations are available within our framework. Using examples involving both silhouettes and edge images, we demonstrate how the solution to the graph matching problem provides us with correspondences and a dissimilarity score that can be used for object recognition and similarity-based retrieval."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds.

As a measure of shape equivalence we will use the concept of order structure which in principle can be defined for arbitrary geometric configurations such as points lines and curves. The order structure equivalence of subsets of points and tangent directions of a shape is will be used to establish pointwise correspondence.

A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location.

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

In this paper we demonstrate that specific actions can be recognized in long video sequence by matching shape information extracted from individual frames to stored prototypes representing key frames of the action. The matching algorithm is tolerant to substantial deformation between image and prototype and recognizes qualitatively similar image shapes produced by the body postures. The algorithm is applied to the recognition of specific tennis strokes in up to 2 min long video sequences. Using key-frames within the sequence all (1015) forehand strokes are found with no false positives. The backhand strokes are detected with somewhat lower performance. We conclude that this type of approach to action recognition has large potential for application to automatic video analysis and editing."

Examples include principal component analysis (as used for instance in 'eigen-faces'), independent component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."
