These techniques are very general and particularly adapted to shapes which are much more costly to generate than to display, such as those fractal surfaces defined by iteration of algebraic transformations. In order to deal with the large space and time requirements of calculating these shapes, we introduce a boundary-tracking algorithm particularly adapted for array-processor implementation. The resulting surfaces are then shaded and displayed using z-buffer type algorithms. A new class of displayable geometric objects, with great diversity of form and texture, is introduced by these techniques."

We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as \u201cfractional Brownian motion,\u201d has been developed by Mandelbrot.\nThe value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively."

Fractals is a whole new field of mathematics that models the most interdisciplinary grab-bag of naturally occurring forms, such as coastlines and clouds, crystals, snowflakes and cosmological structures. This new English edition with its triking format and illustrations doe justice to the idio yncratic geniu of the author in a way that the parsimonious French ver ion did not. Mandelbrot, who ha had chairs in economics, engineering, physiology, as well as everal of the choice t plums of the world of mathematics, is a jack-of-all-mathematical trades to IBM. Both the term and the field of fractals are his invention and pet, though he is also reverently anecdotal about the' prior history of the concepts of wiggliness involved in Brownian motion and the work of Edmund Fournier D'Albe, Lewis Fry Richard on and the many cia ical mathematicians who hav contributed to this theory. The idea of fractals extend to both random and non-random sets, and is defined as a set for which the Hausdorff-Be icovitch dimension trictly exceeds the topologica] dimen ion. Both of the e dimensionalities lie between zero and the dimension of the Euclidean space in which one works. The topological dimension i always an integer for Brownian motion, for example, it is unity, whereas the Hausdorff-Besicovitch i of value two, and for other fractals its value is not necessarily integral. Mandelbrot gives an intere ting and simple illu tration of the way in which dimensionalities of thi art depend on an interaction between the object observed and the resolving power of the observer. Consider, he suggests, a ball 10 cm in diameter, wound of a thick thread 1mm in diameter. To an observer at a di tance of 10 m it appears as a zerodimensional point. At 10 cm it i perceived a a three-dimensional ball. At 10 mm it seems to be a one-dimensional mess of thread. At 0.1 mm each thread would be seen as a column which is again a three-dimensional figure. At 0.01 mm each column"

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72% were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65% with augmented correlation statistics, and 94% with texture energy statistics."

Stochastic methods are developed for the generation of pairs of synthetic texture fields possessing multiple gray levels, significant spatial correlation, and joint moments or probability densities of controllable form. Results of several visual discrimination experiments with these computer generated texture fields are then presented. It is demonstrated, for the stochastic models investigated, that humans cannot effortlessly discriminate between pairs of spatially correlated texture fields with differing third-order probability densities when their lower order densities are pairwise equal. This is a further verification of Julesz's conjecture. Also, it is shown that human observers are sensitive to relatively small changes in the spatial autocorrelation function. Examples are presented of discriminable texture fields with identical means, variances, autocorrelation functions, and third-order nearest neighbor moments."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

The obtained two-dimensional estimator characterizes the texture of the sample and can be used to discriminate other classes of textures. This texture characterization technique is applied to image partitioning, and two partitioning procedures are developed. Experimental results obtained by their application are also shown."
