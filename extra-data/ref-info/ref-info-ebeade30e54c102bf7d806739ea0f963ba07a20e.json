In particular tables are powerful tools that allow large quantities of data to be easily understood. An automated document entry system is needed that can recognize the document layout objects and extract the information from tables. In this paper an effective table recognition method is described. The proposed method is composed of three steps: (1) document layout structure recognition (2) table layout structure recognition (3) table content recognition. To develop the table layout structure recognition step we first examined the layout structure of tables in existing documents and classified several common structures. As a result of the examination we created ten rules and designed a ruled line and box extraction algorithm based on these rules. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed in experiments. Accordingly the proposed method will greatly contribute to the creation of an automated document entry system to allow faster document recognition and permit the data in tables to be extracted."

These tables include records of cable counts, cables in service, assignment charts, and cable running and wiring lists. An interesting problem in these drawings is that the changes to the data are occasionally recorded by crossing out entries and appending the changes rather than redrawing the entire documents. The objective of the work described here is the extraction of information contained in these table structured documents to facilitate the creation of a computer database. Our software system makes use of contextual information in these drawings (e.g., a particular line pattern is used to represent repeated entries, ignore crossed-out entries, etc.). The system uses features like inter-line spacing, length of lines, line orientation, and start and end locations of the lines to detect the diagonal lines and vertical lines with demarcations. Experimental results are also included."

It is intended for use in an automated system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

The algorithm has two parts: first a row labeling algorithm groups similar rows into clusters then, a column labeling algorithm identifies the column structure within each cluster. Each column structure is identified by a set of column separation intervals that are computed from the intervals representing the extent of the white spacing between consecutive word fragments. We formally describe a method for finding column separation intervals based on word fragment separation intervals. This method is based on constructing a closure of a set of line intervals under the operation of line intersection. The closure is maintained dynamically in a data structure which facilitates easy access to the elements within the closure. This technique is computationally less expensive than projection and search at the pixel level since word fragment acquisition is already required for document recognition applications."
