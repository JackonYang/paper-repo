                "text": "A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology."

This algorithm exhibits good performance in reaching the optimum minimization of a cost function for vector quantization data compression. The soft-max rule employed is an extension of the standard K-means clustering procedure and takes into account a neighborhood ranking of the reference (weight) vectors. It is shown that the dynamics of the reference (weight) vectors during the input-driven adaptation procedure are determined by the gradient of an energy function whose shape can be modulated through a neighborhood determining parameter and resemble the dynamics of Brownian particles moving in a potential determined by the data point density. The network is used to represent the attractor of the Mackey-Glass equation and to predict the Mackey-Glass time series, with additional local linear mappings for generating output values. The results obtained for the time-series prediction compare favorably with the results achieved by backpropagation and radial basis function networks."

The evolutionary algorithm used in EPNet is based on Fogel's evolutionary programming (EP). Unlike most previous studies on evolving ANN's, this paper puts its emphasis on evolving ANN's behaviors. Five mutation operators proposed in EPNet reflect such an emphasis on evolving behaviors. Close behavioral links between parents and their offspring are maintained by various mutations, such as partial training and node splitting. EPNet evolves ANN's architectures and connection weights (including biases) simultaneously in order to reduce the noise in fitness evaluation. The parsimony of evolved ANN's is encouraged by preferring node/connection deletion to addition. EPNet has been tested on a number of benchmark problems in machine learning and ANNs, such as the parity problem, the medical diagnosis problems, the Australian credit card assessment problem, and the Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem. The experimental results show that EPNet can produce very compact ANNs with good generalization ability in comparison with other algorithms."

The model relies on hypothetical elementary devices made up of three neurons, the synaptic triads, which yield short-term modification of synaptic efficacy through heterosynaptic interactions, and on a local Hebbian learning rule. The functional units postulated are mutually inhibiting clusters of synergic neurons and bundles of synapses. Networks formalized on this basis display capacities for passive recognition and for production of temporal sequences that may include repetitions. Introduction of the learning rule leads to the differentiation of sequence-detecting neurons and to the stabilization of ongoing temporal sequences. A network architecture composed of three layers of neuronal clusters is shown to exhibit active recognition and learning of time sequences by selection: the network spontaneously produces prerepresentations that are selected according to their resonance with the input percepts. Predictions of the model are discussed."

                "text": "This article explores dynamical properties of the olivo-cerebellar system that arise from the specific wiring of inferior olive (IO), cerebellar cortex, and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). We show that the irregularity observed in the firing pattern of the IO neurons is not necessarily produced by noise but can instead be the result of a purely deterministic network effect. We propose that this effect can serve as a dynamical working memory or as a neuronal clock with a characteristic timescale of about 100 ms that is determined by the slow calcium dynamics of IO and DCN neurons. This concept provides a novel explanation of how the cerebellum can solve timing tasks on a timescale that is two orders of magnitude longer than the millisecond timescale usually attributed to neuronal dynamics. One of the key ingredients of our model is the observation that due to postinhibitory rebound, DCN neurons can be driven by GABAergic (inhibitory) input from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Topographic projections from the DCN to the IO form a closed reverberating loop with an overall synaptic transmission delay of about 100 ms that is in resonance with the intrinsic oscillatory properties of the inferior olive. We use a simple time-discrete model based on McCulloch-Pitts neurons in order to investigate in a first step some of the fundamental properties of a network with delayed reverberating projections. The macroscopic behavior is analyzed by means of a mean-field approximation. Numerical simulations, however, show that the microscopic dynamics has a surprisingly rich structure that does not show up in a mean-field description. We have thus performed extensive numerical experiments in order to quantify the ability of the network to serve as a dynamical working memory and its vulnerability by noise. In a second step, we develop a more realistic conductance-based network model of the inferior olive consisting of about 20 multicompartment neurons that are coupled by gap junctions and receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input via AMPA and GABAergic synapses. The simulations show that results for the time-discrete model hold true in a time-continuous description."

Participants were given 2000 data points and were asked to predict the next 200 points in the series. The winning entry exploited symmetry that was discovered during exploratory data analysis and a method of local modeling designed specifically for the prediction of chaotic time-series. This method includes an exponentially weighted metric, a nearest trajectory algorithm, integrated local averaging, and a novel multistep ahead cross-validation estimation of model error for the purpose of parameter optimization."

It remains unknown, however, whether real-time processing of cortical signals can be employed to reproduce, in a robotic device, the kind of complex arm movements used by primates to reach objects in space. Here we recorded the simultaneous activity of large populations of neurons, distributed in the premotor, primary motor and posterior parietal cortical areas, as non-human primates performed two distinct motor tasks. Accurate real-time predictions of one- and three-dimensional arm movement trajectories were obtained by applying both linear and nonlinear algorithms to cortical neuronal ensemble activity recorded from each animal. In addition, cortically derived signals were successfully used for real-time control of robotic devices, both locally and through the Internet. These results suggest that long-term control of complex prosthetic robot arm movements can be achieved by simple real-time transformations of neuronal population signals derived from multiple cortical areas in primates."

From the recorded responses in a sensory circuit, what information can we extract about the outside world? Here we used a linear decoding technique to reconstruct spatiotemporal visual inputs from ensemble responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the cat. From the activity of 177 cells, we have reconstructed natural scenes with recognizable moving objects. The quality of reconstruction depends on the number of cells. For each point in space, the quality of reconstruction begins to saturate at six to eight pairs of on and off cells, approaching the estimated coverage factor in the LGN of the cat. Thus, complex visual inputs can be reconstructed with a simple decoding algorithm, and these analyses provide a basis for understanding ensemble coding in the early visual pathway."

                "text": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the prefrontal (PF) cortex and basal ganglia are important in cognitive aspects of serial order in behavior. We present a modular neural network model of these areas that encodes the serial order of events into spatial patterns of PF activity. The model is based on the topographically specific circuits linking the PF with the basal ganglia. Each module traces a pathway from the PF, through the basal ganglia and thalamus, and back to the PF. The complete model consists of an array of modules interacting through recurrent corticostriatal projections and collateral inhibition between striatal spiny units. The model's architecture positions spiny units for the classification of cortical contexts and events and provides bistable cortical-thalamic loops for sustaining a representation of these contextual events in working memory activations. The model was tested with a simulated version of a delayed-sequencing task. In single-unit studies, the task begins with the presentation of a sequence of target lights. After a short delay, the monkey must touch the targets in the order in which they were presented. When instantiated with randomly distributed corticostriatal weights, the model produces different patterns of PF activation in response to different target sequences. These patterns represent an unambiguous and spatially distributed encoding of the sequence. Parameter studies of these random networks were used to compare the computational consequences of collateral and feed-forward inhibition within the striatum. In addition, we studied the receptive fields of 20,640 model units and uncovered an interesting set of cue-, rank- and sequence-related responses that qualitatively resemble responses reported in single unit studies of the PF. The majority of units respond to more than one sequence of stimuli. A method for analyzing serial receptive fields is presented and utilized for comparing the model units to single-unit data."

On the nanometer scale, we observed the coexistence of ordered surface water and crystallite-like ice structures, evident in the superposition of Bragg spots and Debye-Scherrer rings. The structures were determined to be dominantly cubic, but each undergoes different dynamics after the ultrafast substrate temperature jump. From changes in local bond distances (OH\u00b7\u00b7O and O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) with time, we elucidated the structural changes in the far-from-equilibrium regime at short times and near-equilibration at long times."
