We show that significantly better correlations can be achieved by placing more weight on recall than on precision. While this may seem unexpected, since BLEU and NIST focus on n-gram precision and disregard recall, our experiments show that correlation with human judgments is highest when almost all of the weight is assigned to recall. We also show that stemming is significantly beneficial not just to simpler unigram precision and recall based metrics, but also to BLEU and NIST."

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision, unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules."

Translation Edit Rate (TER) measures the amount of editing that a human would have to perform to change a system output so it exactly matches a reference translation. We show that the single-reference variant of TER correlates as well with human judgments of MT quality as the four-reference variant of BLEU. We also define a human-targeted TER (or HTER) and show that it yields higher correlations with human judgments than BLEU\u2014even when BLEU is given human-targeted references. Our results indicate that HTER correlates with human judgments better than HMETEOR and that the four-reference variants of TER and HTER correlate with human judgments as well as\u2014or better than\u2014a second human judgment does."

In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct sentences. In this paper, we will present a new evaluation measure which explicitly models block reordering as an edit operation. Our measure can be exactly calculated in quadratic time. Furthermore, we will show how some evaluation measures can be improved by the introduction of word-dependent substitution costs. The correlation of the new measure with human judgment has been investigated systematically on two different language pairs. The experimental results will show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in sentence-level correlation. Results from experiments with word dependent substitution costs will demonstrate an additional increase of correlation between automatic evaluation measures and human judgment."

In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count.

                "text": "Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) is an effective means to estimate the feature function weights of a linear model such that an automated evaluation criterion for measuring system performance can directly be optimized in training. To accomplish this, the training procedure determines for each feature function its exact error surface on a given set of candidate translations. The feature function weights are then adjusted by traversing the error surface combined over all sentences and picking those values for which the resulting error count reaches a minimum. Typically, candidates in MERT are represented as N-best lists which contain the N most probable translation hypotheses produced by a decoder. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that allows for efficiently constructing and representing the exact error surface of all translations that are encoded in a phrase lattice. Compared to N-best MERT, the number of candidate translations thus taken into account increases by several orders of magnitudes. The proposed method is used to train the feature function weights of a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Experiments conducted on the NIST 2008 translation tasks show significant runtime improvements and moderate BLEU score gains over N-best MERT."
