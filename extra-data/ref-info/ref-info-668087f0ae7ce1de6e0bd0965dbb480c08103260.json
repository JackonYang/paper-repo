These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models. Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition."

                "text": "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception. Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations. Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the System Development Foundation.

We propose an architecture in which time serves as its own representation, and temporal context is encoded in the state of the nodes. We contrast this with the approach of replicating portions of the architecture to represent time. \n \nAs one example of these ideas, we demonstrate an architecture with capacitive inputs serving as temporal feature detectors in an otherwise standard back propagation model. Experiments involving motion detection and word discrimination serve to illustrate novel features of the system. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the architecture."

This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition."

Each word was presented repeatedly, and its presentation time (duration from the onset of the word) increased at each successive pass. After each pass, subjects were asked to write down the word being presented and to indicate how confident they were about each guess. In addition to replicating a frequency, a context, and a word-length effect, this \u201cgating\u201d paradigm allowed us to study more closely the narrowing-in process employed by listeners in the isolation and recognition of words: Some delay appears to exist between the moment a word is isolated from other word candidates and the moment it is recognized; word candidates differ in number and in type from one context to the other; and, like syntactic processing, word recognition is strewn with garden paths. The active direct access model proposed by Marslen-Wilson and Welsh is discussed in light of these findings."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

With abundant examples and exercises, it helps students learn for themselves how to do historical linguistics. Distinctive to the book is its combination of the traditional standard topics with others now considered vital to historical linguistics: explanations of why languages change; sociolinguistic aspects of linguistic change; syntactic change and grammaticalisation; distant genetic relationships; and linguistic prehistory. In addition, this edition contains two new chapters on morphological change and quantitative approaches; an expanded chapter on language contact with new sections on pidgins and creoles, mixed languages, and endangered languages; new sections on the language families and language isolates of the world; examination of specific proposals of distant genetic relationship; and a new section on writing systems. With its clear, readable style, expert guidance and comprehensive coverage, Historical Linguistics: An Introduction is not only an invaluable textbook for students coming to the subject for the first time, but also an enlightening read for specialists in the field and non-specialists alike. It is a practical hands-on approach to the subject, including numerous student exercises. It includes examples that are taken from a wide range of languages, including non-Indo-European languages, illustrate concepts and methods. Engaging writing style combined with insightful coverage makes this an engrossing introduction. A Separate pdf 'Answer Key' available for lecturers."

The propagation of activation in these networks is determined by dissipative differential equations. The error signal is backpropagated by integrating an associated differential equation. The method is introduced by applying it to the recurrent generalization of the feedforward backpropagation network. The method is extended to the case of higher order networks and to a constrained dynamical system for training a content addressable memory. The essential feature of the adaptive algorithms is that adaptive equation has a simple outer product form. \n \nPreliminary experiments suggest that learning can occur very rapidly in networks with recurrent connections. The continuous formalism makes the new approach more suitable for implementation in VLSI."

A model is presented which details the ways in which children in different language communities acquire the morphophonological structure of their languages. In this model, the processes of rote, combination, and analogy are integrated into a single processing goal stack. The model views learning as a cyclical process in which acquisition leads to application, application leads to correction, and correction leads to renewed acquisition. The processes of acquisition, application, and correction are formulated in relatively precise terms. The empirical aspects of the model are then summarized as a series of 16 claims. The validity of these 16 claims is evaluated in the light of experimental and diary data on the acquisition of Arabic, Chinese, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Latvian, Russian, and Spanish. Experiment 1 examines the acquisition of nine patterns in Hungarian morphophonology by children between 2 and 6 years of age. It indicates that the sequence of acquisition of morphophonological productions is determined chiefly by applicability as defined by the model. Experiment 2 indicates that preschoolers tend to avoid acquisition of synonymous inflections. Experiment 3 gives some evidence that Hungarian 5-year-olds can use information on allomorphic variations to determine the use of allomorph selection productions. Experiment 4 examines the learning of the German plural formation by children between the ages of 3 and 11. The order of acquisition of strategies in plural formation was determined by the interaction of applicability and correctness, as suggested by the model. Experiment 5 gives evidence for the ordering of rote, combination, and analogy as a goal stack in the formation of German gender. The concluding chapters review the success of the model in accounting for the available data on the acquisition of morphophonology. In general, the model constitutes an advance in our ability to account for the acquisition of complex linguistic structures in terms of specific cognitive processing. Every normal newborn is, in a sense, a subject in a vast experiment of nature. Each of these newborns brings to this experiment some set of abilities"

Two experiments were carried out using Swinney's (1979) cross-modal paradigm. The sentential contexts were constructed in such a way as to make salient the most characteristic features of either the dominant (Experiment 1) or the secondary (Experiment 2) meaning of the ambiguous word. The claim was that if context is sufficiently constraining selective access of the congruent meaning can be obtained. Consistent with this prediction, context biasing the dominant meaning facilitated lexical decision only on target words related to the dominant meaning. When context biased the secondary meaning, both context and dominance produced a facilitation effect."
