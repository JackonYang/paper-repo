Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

                "text": "The availability of large, heterogeneous repositories of electronic documents is increasing rapidly, and the need for flexible, sophisticated document manipulation tools is growing correspondingly. These tools can benefit greatly by exploiting logical structure, a hierarchy of visually observable organizational components of a document, such as paragraphs, lists, sections, etc. Knowledge of this structure can enable a multiplicity of applications, including hierarchical browsing, structural hyperlinking, logical component-based retrieval, and style translation. \nMost work on the problem of deriving logical structure from document layout either relies on knowledge of the particular document style or finds a single flat set of text blocks. This thesis describes an implemented approach to discovering a full logical hierarchy in generic text documents, based primarily on layout information. Since the styles of the documents are not known a priori, the precise layout effects of the logical structure are unknown. Nonetheless, typographical capabilities and conventions provide cues that can be used to deduce a logical structure for a generic document. In particular, the key idea is that analyses of the text contours at appropriate levels of granularity offer a rich source of information about document structure. \nThe problem of logical structure discovery is divided into problems of segmentation, which separates the text into logical pieces, and classification, which labels the pieces with structure types. The segmentation algorithm relies entirely on layout-based cues, and the classification algorithm uses word-based information only when this is demonstrably unavoidable. Thus, this approach is particularly appropriate for scanned-in documents, since it is more robust with respect to OCR errors than a content-oriented approach would be. It is applicable, however, to the problem of analyzing any electronic document whose original formatting style rules remain unknown; thus, it can provide the basis for flexible document manipulation tools in heterogeneous collections."

The resulting image degradations can be categorized based either on observable degradation features or on degradation model parameters. The degradation features can be related mathematically to model parameters. In this paper we statistically compare pairs of populations of degraded character images created with different model parameters. The changes in the probability that the characters are from different populations when the model parameters vary correlate with the relationship between observable degradation features and the model parameters. The paper also shows which features have the largest impact on the image."
