A document image is a bit-map produced by raster-digitizing (scanning) a printed page from technical journals. It may contain fields of text, formulas, tables and figures. Publication-specific knowledge is used in the segmentation and labeling of these blocks. This knowledge is coded in the form of block-grammars that describe the spatial relationships between various entity classes or blocks. The two-dimensional data in each block is converted to one-dimensional strings, so that string grammars may be applied. Segmenting and labeling these blocks can be envisaged as parsing these strings. Different grammars applied to each segmentable document block until the desired sub-blocks are extracted. Starting with the horizontal direction for the whole document page, each level in the hierarchy is processed in a direction orthogonal to the previous level. The grammars are implemented using lexical and syntax analysis tools such as Lex and Yacc. These block-grammars can be meticulously coded by hand or generated from a parameter table. \nErroneous segmentations and labelings may be corrected, at any particular level and at higher levels, by using multiple grammars and backtracking. Finally, the maximum possible area of the document is labeled and presented. The method is applied to printed pages digitized at 300 dpi. Experimental results are shown for a training set of 41 pages and a test set of 24 pages from the IBM Journal of Research and Development and the IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence."

The second application will automate the selection of suitable portions of the document ( e.g., abstracts) for subsequent optical character recognition for full-text search of journals and reports in paper form.

The document image acquisition process and the knowledge base that must be entered into the system to process a family of page images are described. The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing.

We have collected statistical information on scanned pages of technical articles as a by-product of digitized document analysis. Specifically, in our hierarchical block segmentation and labeling approach (syntactic), 65 training and test pages from two publications were used. Additional information on compression and profiles was also used. Pixel-level information is required as input whether the analyzing tool is an expert system or something else. The issues covered are: (1) Profile characteristics of document objects like text, line drawings, tables, and half-tones, and the variation of these profiles with block size, type size, and direction of scan. (2) Speckle noise: sizes and distribution. (3) For the hierarchical (syntactic) approach, number of tree nodes at each level along with their areas, and comparison with node areas derived from transition-cut trees. (4) CCITT-Group 4 compression statistics on document sub-blocks and whole pages. (5) Size of postscript files and postscript commands used in printing these page files. We believe that these results would allow predicting some characteristics of a printed page digitized at any specified sampling rate."

This is the first book to offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art research papers, including authoritative critical surveys of the literature, and parallel studies of the architectureof complete high-performance printed-document reading systems. A unique feature is the extended section on music notation, an ideal vehicle for international sharing of basic research. Also, the collection includes important new work on line drawings, handwriting, character and symbol recognition, and basic methodological issues. The IAPR 1990 Workshop on Syntactic and Structural Pattern Recognition is summarized,including the reports of its expert working groups, whose debates provide a fascinating perspective on the field. The book is an excellent text for a first-year graduate seminar in document image analysis,and is likely to remain a standard reference in the field for years."

It is well suited for editor-script type transformations and for segmenting input in preparation for a parsing routine. Lex source is a table of regular expressions and corresponding program fragments. The table is translated to a program which reads an input stream, copying it to an output stream and partitioning the input into strings which match the given expressions. As each such string is recognized the corresponding program fragment is executed. The recognition of the expressions is performed by a deterministic finite automaton generated by Lex. The program fragments written by the user are executed in the order in which the corresponding regular expressions occur in the input stream. The lexical analysis programs written with Lex accept ambiguous specifications and choose the longest match possible at each input point. If necessary, substantial lookahead is performed on the input, but the input stream will be backed up to the end of the current partition, so that the user has general freedom to manipulate it. Lex can generate analyzers in either C or Ratfor, a language which can be translated automatically to portable Fortran. It is available on the PDP-11 UNIX, Honeywell GCOS, and IBM OS systems. This manual, however, will only discuss generating analyzers in C on the UNIX system, which is the only supported form of Lex under UNIX Version 7. Lex is designed to simplify interfacing with Yacc, for those with access to this compiler-compiler system."

An input language may be as complex as a programming language, or as simple as a sequence of numbers. Unfortunately, usual input facilities are limited, difficult to use, and often are lax about checking their inputs for validity. Yacc provides a general tool for describing the input to a computer program. The Yacc user specifies the structures of his input, together with code to be invoked as each such structure is recognized. Yacc turns such a specification into a subroutine that handles the input process; frequently, it is convenient and appropriate to have most of the flow of control in the user\u2019s application handled by this subroutine. The input subroutine produced by Yacc calls a user-supplied routine to return the next basic input item. Thus, the user can specify his input in terms of individual input characters, or in terms of higher level constructs such as names and numbers. The user-supplied routine may also handle idiomatic features such as comment and continuation conventions, which typically defy easy grammatical specification."

An image obtained by optical means is modeled as a product of the illumtination and reflectance components. The illumination part is lowpass and the reflectance part which reveals the edge and texture details, is highpass. The homomorphic system as applied to image processing consists of a logarithmic point transformation followed by linear filtering. Homomorphic processing achieves a simultaneous dynamic range reduction and contrast enhancenment. A matrix quantizer operating on such processed images is shown to achieve bit rates as low as 0.16 bpp with acceptable quality."
