                "text": "Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system."

In the final product the tantalum is passivated, as by thermal oxidation, so that the said film is substantially tantalum oxide throughout, except where such film underlies a pair of conductive terminal pads. The terminal pads are spaced on the substrate, so that the resistive path therebetween is defined through the nickel-chromium thin film - via the thin metallic tantalum film interfacing between the nickel-chromium film and conductive pads. The overlying tantalum oxide provides a very high degree of environmental protection with respect to the Ni-Cr film, whereby the product not only displays the desirably low TCR characteristics of Ni-Cr, but is also highly resistant to moisture and other environmental factors. The product also exhibits outstanding resistance to the adverse effects of electrolysis supported by the presence of moisture. The various films, including a gold film from which the terminal pads are derived, may be deposited upon the inert substrate by sequential sputtering during a single evacuation of a vacuum chamber. Desired resistive patterns may then be formed by photo-etching, subsequent to which oxidation of accessible portions of the tantalum film can be effected by heating in an appropriate atmosphere."
