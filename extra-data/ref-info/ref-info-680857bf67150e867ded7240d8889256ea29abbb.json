Formula extraction is first done by location of its most significant symbols, then extension to adjoining symbols using contextual rules until delimitation of the whole formula space. Mathematical symbol labelling is realised from models created at the learning stage using fuzzy logic. From the experiments, we found that the average rate of primary labelling of mathematical symbols is about 95.3%. The obtained results have demonstrated the applicability of our system since 90% of mathematical formulas are well extracted from documents printed with high quality."

Automatic recognition of mathematical expressions is one of the key vehicles in the drive towards transcribing documents in scientific and engineering disciplines into electronic form. This problem typically consists of two major stages, namely, symbol recognition and structural analysis. In this survey paper, we will review most of the existing work with respect to each of the two major stages of the recognition process. In particular, we try to put emphasis on the similarities and differences between systems. Moreover, some important issues in mathematical expression recognition will be addressed in depth. All these together serve to provide a clear overall picture of how this research area has been developed to date."

This hierarchy in the text has been introduced by means of the notion of mathematical object, that we characterise by a set of definitions. A prior segmentation phase of mathematical objects in text is performed, using character matching techniques and propagating the labelling process of mathematical objects around \"special characters\" initially recognised. Complex and dynamical tree representations are proposed for mathematical expressions detected in the text, and a dynamical set of priority rules has been defined that guides this automatic process. Finally the recognition of the elementary objects obtained permits to achieve the encoding of a mathematical expression."

In the detection stage, a connected component initially recognized into some category is judged as a candidate of touched characters if its feature values deviate from the standard feature values of the category. In the segmentation stage, two component characters of the candidate are decided by the comparison with touching character images synthesized from two single character images. Experimental results showed the effectiveness on the accuracy improvement of the recognition of mathematical expressions."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

The method is robust against the recognition errors of characters and the variation of the printing styles of the documents. The outline is as follows: we first construct a network with vertices representing the characters (symbols), linked with each other by several edges with labels and costs representing the possible relations of the pair of characters. The network has multiple edges with different labels and costs representing the ambiguity of the decision of the relation of character pairs. Then, we output the spanning tree of the network with minimum cost which corresponds to the recognition result of the structure of the mathematical formula, using not only the local costs initially attached to the network but the costs reflecting global structure of the formula. The advantage of this method is that local errors of the recognition are recovered automatically by the total cost of the recognition tree."

In the construction of networks, we regard a matrix as a network of elements connected each other by links representing their relative relations, and consider its horizontally projected network and vertically projected one. In the analysis, we obtain the areas of variable block pattern elements generating the minimum rectangular area of the matrix by solving the simultaneous system of equations given by the two projected networks.

                "text": "Speaker: Gerhard O. Michler Institute for Experimental Mathematics Essen University Ellernstrasse 29 45326 Essen, Germany In this lecture a detailed report was given on the results obtained in a digital library project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 1997 to 2000. The following text is taken from the introduction of the authors\u2019 article \u201cReport on the Retrodigitization Project Archiv der Mathematik\u201c which is to appear in Archiv der Mathematik in 2001. Nowadays many mathematical journals are published electronically, in general in portable document format (PDF). For example, the servers of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) contain at present more than 4700 articles published electronically from 1996 to date in the journals of the AMS that are accessible and searchable online to subscribers via the internet address: www.ams.org/journals. The PDF-format offers many advantages over the traditional paper format of a printed article. Authorized users can also link from journal articles references to the reviews in the Mathematical Reviews of the AMS, and in due course from there to the original quoted articles, if available in PDF. The online access also allows to make printouts of wanted articles at the user\u2019s printer and to view abstracts of recently posted articles to be published shortly. In view of the vaste literature in mathematics the search functions provided by the software of a distributed digital library for specific articles and/or specific results or concepts explained in such an article are very useful for researchers and graduate students. They also would like to have such a comfortable access to the back issues of the mathematical journals published only in paper format. The proofs of many important old theorems have never been incorporated into standard textbooks because they are still too complicated to be derived from generally known theoretical results. Therefore modern research articles have to quote arguments, methods, partial and final results of old papers. Thus it is desirable to retrodigitize the back issues of a mathematical journal and combine them with the electronically published recent issues in such a way that all the volumes of the resulting digital journal are searchable and linked to \u201cMathematical Reviews\u201c or \u201cZentralblatt Mathematik\u201c. Through these review journals the retrodigitized volumes could then be linked to all other mathematical journals belonging to a distributed digital mathematical library. In particular, an authorized user of such a library would be able to read on screen an original article and a cited article or a review at the same time. This retrodigitization task is very demanding and requires a deep understanding of mathematics, computer science and the support of the publisher. Using the IBM digital library database and the MILESS software developed by the Computer Center of Essen University we have been able to construct a prototype of a searchable and retrievable digital library \u201cArchiv der Mathematik\u201c. It contains 1) the retrodigitized volumes 60 (1993) 67 (1996) in MVD format, 2) the electronically published volumes 68 (1997) 73 (1999) in PDF format. The cited journal articles of the references of all 13 volumes are recognized automatically as well as the layout of the first page of each article. Thus it is possible to produce the bibliographic data including the ISSN of all journal articles of the 13 volumes and their references in XML format. In particular, all these articles and the cited journal articles of their references can be linked automatically to MathSciNet or Zentralblatt MATH. The methods developed in this pilot project can be adjusted for the retrodigitization of other mathematical journals and older back issues of \u201cArchiv der Mathematik\u201c."
