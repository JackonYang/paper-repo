                "text": "This paper addresses the problem of computing cues to the three-dimensional structure of surfaces in the world directly from the local structure of the brightness pattern of either a single monocular image or a binocular image pair. It is shown that starting from Gaussian derivatives of order up to two at a range of scales in scale-space, local estimates of (i) surface orientation from monocular perspective texture foreshortening, (ii) surface orientation or curvature from monocular texture gradients, and (iii) surface orientation from the binocular disparity gradient can be computed without iteration or search, and by using essentially the same basic mechanism. The methodology is based on a multi-scale descriptor of image structure called the windowed second moment matrix, which is computed with adaptive selection of both scale levels and spatial positions. Notably, this descriptor comprises two scale parameters, a local scale describing the amount of smoothing used in derivative computations, and an integration scale determining over how large a region in space the statistics of local descriptors is accumulated. Experimental results for both synthetic and natural images are presented, and the relation with models of biological vision is brie y discussed.

Frisby at University of She eld for kindly providing several of the images used in the paper. This work was partially performed under the ESPRIT-BRA project INSIGHT.

Indeed, human stereopsis may possess a mechanism that specifically makes use of these orientation and spatial frequency disparities, in addition to the usual cue of horizontal disparity. In machine vision algorithms, orientation and spatial frequency disparities are a source of error in finding stereo correspondence because one seeks to find features or areas which are similar in the two views when, in fact, they are systematically different. In other words, it is common to treat as noise what is useful signal."

This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping."

It is shown how the imposition of such a limit can provide a suitable balance between the twin requirements of disambiguating power and the ability to deal with a wide range of surfaces. Next, the design of a very simple stereo algorithm called PMF is described. In conjunction with certain other constraints used in many other stereo algorithms, PMF employs a limit on allowable disparity gradients of 1, a value that coincides with that reported for human stereoscopic vision. The excellent performance of PMF is illustrated on a series of natural and artificial stereograms. Finally, the differences between the theoretical justification for the use of disparity gradients for solving the stereo correspondence problems presented in the paper and others that exist in the stereo algorithm literature are discussed."

The so-called structure-from-motion problem is to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections. For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration. Results of a numerical experiment are discussed."

The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "A composite thin film resistor is disclosed, including an electrically inert substrate upon which is deposited a nickel-chromium alloy thin film, and an overlying second thin film - which is initially deposited as metallic tantalum. In the final product the tantalum is passivated, as by thermal oxidation, so that the said film is substantially tantalum oxide throughout, except where such film underlies a pair of conductive terminal pads. The terminal pads are spaced on the substrate, so that the resistive path therebetween is defined through the nickel-chromium thin film - via the thin metallic tantalum film interfacing between the nickel-chromium film and conductive pads. The overlying tantalum oxide provides a very high degree of environmental protection with respect to the Ni-Cr film, whereby the product not only displays the desirably low TCR characteristics of Ni-Cr, but is also highly resistant to moisture and other environmental factors. The product also exhibits outstanding resistance to the adverse effects of electrolysis supported by the presence of moisture. The various films, including a gold film from which the terminal pads are derived, may be deposited upon the inert substrate by sequential sputtering during a single evacuation of a vacuum chamber. Desired resistive patterns may then be formed by photo-etching, subsequent to which oxidation of accessible portions of the tantalum film can be effected by heating in an appropriate atmosphere."
