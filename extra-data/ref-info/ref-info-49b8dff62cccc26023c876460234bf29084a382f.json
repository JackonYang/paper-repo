Under the assumption that the data lie on a submanifold in a high dimensional space, we develop an algorithmic framework to classify a partially labeled data set in a principled manner. The central idea of our approach is that classification functions are naturally defined only on the submanifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the Laplace-Beltrami operator one produces a basis (the Laplacian Eigenmaps) for a Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the submanifold. To recover such a basis, only unlabeled examples are required. Once such a basis is obtained, training can be performed using the labeled data set.Our algorithm models the manifold using the adjacency graph for the data and approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator by the graph Laplacian. We provide details of the algorithm, its theoretical justification, and several practical applications for image, speech, and text classification."

                "text": "We consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost performance of a learning algorit,hrn when only a small set of labeled examples is available. In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

While regular Support Vector Machines (SVMs) try to induce a general decision function for a learning task, Transductive Support Vector Machines take into account a particular test set and try to minimize misclassi cations of just those particular examples. The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes an algorithm for training TSVMs e ciently, handling 10,000 examples and more."

The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems."

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry: and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two \"related\" objects. We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem. We provide the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric-all distances are the same-our methods provide a 2-approximation."

This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The approach combines high performance and efficiency with theoretical understanding and improved robustness. In particular, it is highly effective without greedy heuristic components. The SVM approach is computationally efficient in training and classification, and it comes with a learning theory that can guide real-world applications. Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines gives a complete and detailed description of the SVM approach to learning text classifiers, including training algorithms, transductive text classification, efficient performance estimation, and a statistical learning model of text classification. In addition, it includes an overview of the field of text classification, making it self-contained even for newcomers to the field. This book gives a concise introduction to SVMs for pattern recognition, and it includes a detailed description of how to formulate text-classification tasks for machine learning."

The really strange story is that most of them (myself included) still believe that developing a linguistically principled approach to text categorization is an interesting research problem. This will also emerge in the discussion of the book that is the focus of this review. Learning to Classify Texts Using Support Vector Machines by Thorsten Joachims proposes a theory for automatic learning of text categorization models that has been repeatedly shown to be very successful. At the same time, the approach proposed is based on a rather rough linguistic generalization of (what apparently is) a language-dependent task: topic text classification (TC). The result is twofold: on the one hand, a learning theory, based on statistical learnability principles and results, that avoids the limitations of the strong empiricism typical of most text classification research; and on the other hand, the application of a naive linguistic model, the bag-of-words representation, to linguistic objects (i.e., the documents) that still achieves impressive accuracy."

In this paper we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words, using which the simultaneous clustering problem can be posed as a bipartite graph partitioning problem. To solve the partitioning problem, we use a new spectral co-clustering algorithm that uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. The spectral algorithm enjoys some optimality properties; it can be shown that the singular vectors solve a real relaxation to the NP-complete graph bipartitioning problem. We present experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algorithm works well in practice."

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-pateh competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optima] partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection."

It is shown that the second smallest eigenvalue of a matrix derived from the netlist gives a provably good approximation of the optimal ratio cut partition cost. It is also demonstrated that fast Lanczos-type methods for the sparse symmetric eigenvalue problem are a robust basis for computing heuristic ratio cuts based on the eigenvector of this second eigenvalue. Effective clustering methods are an immediate by-product of the second eigenvector computation and are very successful on the difficult input classes proposed in the CAD literature. The intersection graph representation of the circuit netlist is considered, as a basis for partitioning, a heuristic based on spectral ratio cut partitioning of the netlist intersection graph is proposed. The partitioning heuristics were tested on industry benchmark suites, and the results were good in terms of both solution quality and runtime. Several types of algorithmic speedups and directions for future work are discussed. >"
