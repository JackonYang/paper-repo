In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

This approach can be applied in a preprocessing step in order to highlight the different kind of information filled in the form and to determine the appropriate treatment. Features used for the classification are relative to the text orientation and to its character morphology. Eight classes are extracted among numeric, alphabetic, vertical, horizontal, capitals, etc. Classifiers are multi-layered perceptrons considering firstly global features and refining the classification at each step by looking for more precise features. The recognition rate of the classifiers for 3. 500 cells issued from 19 forms is about 91%."
