This is a key step inmost problems of computer vision and, so far, no general method exists to solve it. Our methodology is able to handle most of the commonly used assumptions in a unique formulation, independent of the domain of application and type of features. It performs correspondence and outlier rejection in a single step and achieves global optimality with feasible computation. Feature selection and correspondence are first formulated as an integer optimization problem. This is a blunt formulation, which considers the whole combinatorial space of possible point selections and correspondences. To find its global optimal solution, we build a concave objective function and relax the search domain into its convex-hull. The special structure of this extended problem assures its equivalence to the original one, but it can be optimally solved by efficient algorithms that avoid combinatorial search. This methodology can use any criterion provided it can be translated into cost functions with continuous second derivatives."

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

An efficient matching algorithm, which assumes affine approximation to the prospective viewing transformation, is proposed. The algorithm has an offline model preprocessing (shape representation) phase which is independent of the scene information and a recognition phase based on efficient indexing. It has a straightforward parallel implementation. The algorithm was successfully tested in recognition of industrial objects appearing in composite occluded scenes. >"

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

                "text": "This paper describes a visual object detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without rounding. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>"

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

Our dataset is 44,773 face images, obtained by applying a face finder to approximately half a million captioned news images. This dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets, because it contains faces captured \"in the wild\" in a variety of configurations with respect to the camera, taking a variety of expressions, and under illumination of widely varying color. Each face image is associated with a set of names, automatically extracted from the associated caption. Many, but not all such sets contain the correct name. We cluster face images in appropriate discriminant coordinates. We use a clustering procedure to break ambiguities in labelling and identify incorrectly labelled faces. A merging procedure then identifies variants of names that refer to the same individual. The resulting representation can be used to label faces in news images or to organize news pictures by individuals present. An alternative view of our procedure is as a process that cleans up noisy supervised data. We demonstrate how to use entropy measures to evaluate such procedures."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

We represent the statistics of both object appearance and \"non-object\" appearance using a product of histograms. Each histogram represents the joint statistics of a subset of wavelet coefficients and their position on the object. Our approach is to use many such histograms representing a wide variety of visual attributes. Using this method, we have developed the first algorithm that can reliably detect human faces with out-of-plane rotation and the first algorithm that can reliably detect passenger cars over a wide range of viewpoints."

The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

The results demonstrate the superiority of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality, using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as \u2018lines\u2019 and \u2018edges\u2019 are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points \u2018local energy\u2019 is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90\u00b0: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

All growths were performed in an MOVPE reactor operating at a pressure of 200 mBar and temperature of 630 degrees C. Typical growth rates ranged from 4-7 AA/sec. Reagents used were trimethyl and triethyl group III and hydride group V precursors."
