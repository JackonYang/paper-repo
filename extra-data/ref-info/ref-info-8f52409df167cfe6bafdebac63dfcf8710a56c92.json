The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

While the T-Recs results of the processing steps so far look pretty good on documents like articles which might occasionally contain the one or the other table (amongst regular paragraphs), the identification of tables gets confused by logical objects such as recipient address, date or company specific printing within business letters heads if those layout objects occur in a horizontal (left-of, right-o]) neighborship. To increase the precision z for correctly recognized tables in the above mentioned domain of business letters, we developed an additional processing step with has the purpose to determine clusters of cells that show up more evident features of a table than just the left-of, right-of relation between some blocks."

However, there are many cases where knowledge of both the language and layout is required in order to establish the boundaries of the basic textual blocks. This paper describes a number of these cases and proposes the application of a general method combining knowledge about language with knowledge about the spatial arrangement of text.

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The logical structure of a document conveys semantic information that is beyond the document's character string contents. To capture this additional semantics, document understanding must relate the document's physical layout to its logical structure. This work provides a formal deenition of the logical structure of text-intensive documents. A generic framework using a hierarchy of textons is described for the interpretation of any text-intensive document logical structure. The recursive deenition of textons provides a powerful and exible tool that is not restricted by the size or complexity of the document. Frames are analogously used as recursive constructs for the physical structure description. To facilitate the reverse engineering process which is required to derive the logical structure, we describe DAFS| a Document Attribute Format Specii-cation and demonstrate how our framework can serve as a conceptual framework for enhancements of DAFS."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."
