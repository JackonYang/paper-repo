We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes."

These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization, and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure, such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower computational cost."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

A model includes parts\u2019 appearance, as well as location and scale relations between parts. The object class is generatively modeled using a simple Bayesian network with a central hidden node containing location and scale information, and nodes describing object parts. The model\u2019s parameters, however, are optimized to reduce a loss function of the training error, as in discriminative methods. We show how boosting techniques can be extended to optimize the relational model proposed, with complexity linear in the number of parts and the number of features per image. This efficiency allows our method to learn relational models with many parts and features. The method has an advantage over purely generative and purely discriminative approaches for learning from sets of salient features, since generative method often use a small number of parts and features, while discriminative methods tend to ignore geometrical relations between parts. Experimental results are described, using some bench-mark data sets and three sets of newly collected data, showing the relative merits of our method in recognition and localization tasks.\n"

The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

Visual recognition algorithms learn models from a set of training examples. Generative models learn their representations by considering data from a single class. Generative models are popular in computer vision for many reasons, including their ability to elegantly incorporate prior knowledge and to handle correspondences between object parts and detected features. However, generative models are often inferior to discriminative models during classification tasks. We study a discriminative approach to learning object categories which maintains the representational power of generative learning, but trains the generative models in a discriminative manner. The discriminatively trained models perform better during classification tasks as a result of selecting discriminative sets of features. We conclude by proposing a multi-class object recognition system which initially trains object classes in a generative manner, identifies subsets of similar classes with high confusion, and finally trains models for these subsets in a discriminative manner to realize gains in classification performance."

We develop a simple texture descriptor that outperforms the state of the art. We test our animal models on two datasets; images taken by professional photographers from the Corel collection, and assorted images from the Web returned by Google. We demonstrate quite good performance on both datasets. Comparing our results with simple baselines, we show that for the Google set, we can recognize objects from a collection demonstrably hard for object recognition."

Without assuming a priori knowledge of scale, pose or appearance, this problem is extremely challenging and demands the use of all possible sources of information. We develop a framework which can incorporate arbitrary pairwise constraints between body parts, such as scale compatibility, relative position, symmetry of clothing and smooth contour connections between parts. We detect candidate body parts from bottom-up using parallelism, and use various pairwise configuration constraints to assemble them together into body configurations. To find the most probable configuration, we solve an integer quadratic programming problem with a standard technique using linear approximations. Approximate IQP allows us to incorporate much more information than the traditional dynamic programming and remains computationally efficient. 15 hand-labeled images are used to train the low-level part detector and learn the pairwise constraints. We show test results on a variety of images."

In previous work we have shown how weak odometric data can be used to improve learning topological models, overcoming the common problems of the standard Baum-Welch algorithm. Odometric data typically contain directional information, which imposes two difficulties: First, the cyclicity of the data requires the use of special circular distributions. Second, small errors in the heading of the robot result in large displacements in the odometric readings it maintains. The cumulative rotational error leads to unreliable odometric readings. In the paper we present solutions to these problems by using a circular distribution and relative coordinate systems. We validate their effectiveness through experimental results from a model-learning application."

The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures. We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted full body configurations."

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing, shallow parsing has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and extensive comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to achieve performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on the CoNLL task, and better than any reported single model. Improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results. We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy models."
