The approach extends traditional Markov random field (MRF) models by learning potential functions over extended pixel neighborhoods. Field potentials are modeled using a Products-of-Experts framework that exploits nonlinear functions of many linear filter responses. In contrast to previous MRF approaches all parameters, including the linear filters themselves, are learned from training data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this Field of Experts model with two example applications, image denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approximate inference scheme. While the model is trained on a generic image database and is not tuned toward a specific application, we obtain results that compete with and even outperform specialized techniques."

It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes, and demonstrate how using this density as \"prior knowledge\" can be used to develop a classifier based on only a single training example for each class."

The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

While the orientation of a receptive field in space determines the selectivity of the neuron to image structures at a particular orientation, a receptive fieldUs orientation in space-time characterizes important additional properties such as velocity and direction selectivity. Previous studies have focused on explaining the spatial receptive field properties of visual neurons by relating them to the statistical structure of static natural images. In this report, we examine the possibility that the distinctive spatiotemporal properties of visual cortical neurons can be understood in terms of a statistically efficient strategy for encoding natural time varying images. We describe an artificial neural network that attempts to accurately reconstruct its spatiotemporal input data while simultaneously reducing the statistical dependencies between its outputs. The network utilizes spatiotemporally summating neurons and learns efficient sparse distributed representations of its spatiotemporal input stream by using recurrent lateral inhibition and a simple threshold nonlinearity for rectification of neural responses. When exposed to natural time varying images, neurons in a simulated network developed localized receptive fields oriented in both space and space-time, similar to the receptive fields of neurons in the primary visual cortex."

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the \"semantic\" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves."

Yet a general and tractable computational model of this ability to untangle the underlying factors of perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter, 1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell & Sejnowski, 1995; Hinton, Dayan, Frey, & Neal, 1995; Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Hinton & Ghahramani, 1997) are either insufficiently rich to capture the complex interactions of perceptually meaningful factors such as phoneme and speaker accent or letter and font, or do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present a general framework for learning to solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations of factor interactions but can nonetheless be fit to data using efficient algorithms based on the singular value decomposition and expectation-maximization. We report promising results on three different tasks in three different perceptual domains: spoken vowel classification with a benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation of fonts to unseen letters, and translation of faces to novel illuminants."

Image analogies are based on a simple multi-scale autoregression, inspired primarily by recent results in texture synthesis. By choosing different types of source image pairs as input, the framework supports a wide variety of \u201cimage filter\u201d effects, including traditional image filters, such as blurring or embossing; improved texture synthesis, in which some textures are synthesized with higher quality than by previous approaches; super-resolution, in which a higher-resolution image is inferred from a low-resolution source; texture transfer, in which images are \u201ctexturized\u201d with some arbitrary source texture; artistic filters, in which various drawing and painting styles are synthesized based on scanned real-world examples; and texture-by-numbers, in which realistic scenes, composed of a variety of textures, are created using a simple painting interface."

The linear model coefficients are straightforward to estimate, and they provide reliable estimates of the optical flow of smooth surfaces. Here we explore the use of parameterized motion models that represent much more varied and complex motions. Our goals are threefold: to construct linear bases for complex motion phenomena; to estimate the coefficients of these linear models; and to recognize or classify image motions from the estimated coefficients. We consider two broad classes of motions: i) generic \u201cmotion features\u201d such as motion discontinuities and moving bars; and ii) non-rigid, object-specific, motions such as the motion of human mouths. For motion features we construct a basis of steerable flow fields that approximate the motion features. For object-specific motions we construct basis flow fields from example motions using principal component analysis. In both cases, the model coefficients can be estimated directly from spatiotemporal image derivatives with a robust, multi-resolution scheme. Finally, we show how these model coefficients can be use to detect and recognize specific motions such as occlusion boundaries and facial expressions."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

                "text": "This thesis presents a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position- and scale-invariant representations of objects in the visual world. The model relies on a set of control neurons to dynamically modify the synaptic strengths of intra-cortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (V1) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial relationships (i.e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex, thus enabling attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. The representation in V1 is modeled as a multiscale stack of sample nodes with progressively lower resolution at higher eccentricities. Large changes in the size of the attentional window are accomplished by switching between different levels of the multiscale stack, while positional shifts and small changes in scale are accomplished by translating and rescaling the window within a single level of the stack. The control signals for setting the position and size of the attentional window are hypothesized to originate from neurons in the pulvinar and in the deep layers of visual cortex. The dynamics of these control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that can be realized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In pre-attentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level \"saliency map\" representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions."

It is shown that performing independent component analysis (ICA) on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with qualitatively similar spatio-temporal properties. Whereas the independent components of video resemble moving edges or bars, the independent component filters, i.e. the analogues of receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids windowed by steady Gaussian envelopes. Contrary to earlier ICA results on static images, which gave only filters at the finest possible spatial scale, the spatio\u2013temporal analysis yields filters at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Filters centred at low spatial frequencies are generally tuned to faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies."

When a familiar object is in an unusual orientation, the deciding factor in the choice of the canonical object-based frame may be the fact that relative to this frame the object has a familiar shape description. This may suggest that we first hypothesise an object-based frame and then test the resultant shape description for familiarity. However, it is possible to organise the interactions between units in a parallel network so that the pattern of activity in the network simultaneously converges on a representation of the shape and a representation of the object-based frame of reference. The connections in the network are determined by the constraints inherent in the image formation process."

Non-CRF inhibition is exhibited by 80% of the orientation-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex of monkeys and has been shown to influence human visual perception as well. Essentially, the response of an edge detector at a certain point is suppressed by the responses of the operator in the region outside the supported area. We combine classical edge detection with isotropic and anisotropic inhibition, both of which have counterparts in biology. We also use a biologically motivated method (the Gabor energy operator) for edge detection. The resulting operator responds strongly to isolated lines, edges, and contours, but exhibits weak or no response to edges that are part of texture. We use natural images with associated ground truth contour maps to assess the performance of the proposed operator for detecting contours while suppressing texture edges. Our method enhances contour detection in cluttered visual scenes more effectively than classical edge detectors used in machine vision (Canny edge detector). Therefore, the proposed operator is more useful for contour-based object recognition tasks, such as shape comparison, than traditional edge detectors, which do not distinguish between contour and texture edges. Traditional edge detection algorithms can, however, also be extended with surround suppression. This study contributes also to the understanding of inhibitory mechanisms in biology."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

This compulation can be implemented in a parallel network of neuron-like processors, but the network has a tendency to make errors of a peculiar kind: When presented with several shapes it sometimes perceives one shape in the position of another. The parameters can be carefully tuned to avoid these \"illusory conjunctions\" in normal circumstances, but they reappear if the visual input is replaced by a random mask before the network has settled down. Treisman and Schmidt (1982) have shown that people make similar errors."

                "text": "T h e Boltzmann machine is a nonlinear network of stochastic binary processing units t ha t interact pairwise through symmetric connection strengths. In a third-order Boltzmann machine, triples of units interact through symmetric conjunctive interactions. The Boltzmann learning algorithm is generalized t o higher-order interactions. The rate of learning for internal representations in a higher-order Boltzmann machine should be much faster t han for a second-order Boltzmann machine based on pairwise interactions. I N T R O D U C T I O N Thousands of hours of practice are required by humans t o become experts in domains such as chess, mathematics and physics1. Learning in these domains requires the mastery of a large number of highly interrelated ideas, and a deep understanding requires generalization as well as memorization. There are two traditions in the literature on learning in neural network models. One class of models is based on the problem of content-addressable memory and emphasizes a fast, one-shot form of learning. The second class of models uses slow, incremental learning, which requires many repetitions of examples. I t is difficult in humans t o s tudy fast and slow learning in isolation. In some amnesics, however, the long-term retention of facts is severely impaired, but the slow acquisition of skills, including cognitive skills, is spared2. Thus, it is possible tha t separate memory mechanisms are used t o implement fast learning and slow learning. Long practice is required t o become a n expert, bu t expert performance is swift and difficult to analyze; with more practice there is faster performance1. Why is slow learning so slow? One possibility is t h a t the expert develops internal representations tha t allow fast parallel searches for solutions t o problems in the task domain, in contrast t o a novice who must apply knowledge piecemeal. An internal representation is a mental model of the task domain; t h a t is, internal degrees of freedom between the sensory inputs and motor outputs t h a t efficiently encode the variables relevant t o the solution of the problem. This approach can be made more precise by specifying neural network models and showing how they incorporate internal representations. L E A R N I N G IN NETWORK M O D E L S Network models of fast learning include linear correlation-matrix m o d e l ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ l ~ and the more recent nonlinear autoassociative m o d e ~ s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ' ~ . These models use the Hebb learning rule t o store information t h a t can be retrieved by the completion of partially specified input patterns. New patterns are stored by imposing the pattern on the network and altering the connection strengths between the pairs of units that are above threshold. The information that is stored therefore concerns the correlations, .or second-order relationships between the components of the pattern. The internal model is built from correlations. Network models of slow learning include the perceptronll and adaline12. These networks can classify input patterns given only examples of inputs and desired outputs. The connection strengths are changed incrementally during the training and the network gradually converges to a set of weights tha t solves the problem if such as set of weights exists. Unfortunately, there are many difficult problems that cannot be solved with these networks, such as the prediction of parity'3. The perceptron and adaline are limited because they have only one layer of modifiable connection strengths and can only implement linear discriminant functions. Higher-order problems like parity cannot be solved by storing the desired patterns using the class of contentaddressable algorithms based on the Hebb learning rule. These models are limited because the metric of similarity is based on Hamming distance and only correlations can be used t o access patterns. The first network model to demonstrably learn t o solve higher-order problems was the Boltzmann machine, which overcame the limitations of previous network models by introducing hidden units14*15116. Hidden units are added t o the network t o mediate between the input and output units; they provide the extra internal degrees of freedom needed t o form internal representations. The Boltzmann learning algorithm incrementally modifies internal connections in the network to build higher-order pattern detectors. The hidden units can be recruited t o form internal representations for any problem; however, the learning may require an extremely large number of training examples and can be excessively slow. One way t o speed up the learning is to use hidden units that have higher-order interactions with other units. THIRD-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Consider a Boltzmann machine with a cubic global energy function: where si is the state of the i t h binary unit and w;p is a weight between triples of units. This type of interaction generalizes the pairwise interactions in Hopfield networkslo and Boltzmann machines, which contribute a quadratic term t o the energy. Fig. 1 shows an interpretation of the cubic term as conjunctive synapses. Each unit in the network updates its binary state asynchronously with probability where T is a parameter the i t h unit is given by analagous t o the temperature and the total input to If wijk is symmetric on all pairs of indices then the energy of the network is nonincreasing. It can be shown that in equilibrium the probabilities of global states P, follow a Boltzmann distribution Fig. 1. Third-order interactions between three units. In the diagram the lines between units represent reciprocal interactions that are activated only when the third unit is in the on state. The third unit acts presynaptically to conjunctively control the painvise interactions. There are two forms of the Boltzmann learning algorithm, one for networks with inputs and outputs treated identically, and a second for networks where the input units are always clamped15. The former learning algorithm will be generalized for third-order interactions. The learning metric on weight space remains the same: where P , is the probability of a global state with both the inputs and outputs clamped, and Pd, is the probability of a global state when the network is allowed to run freely. I t can be shown that the gradient of G is given by where p i jk is the ensemble average probability of three units all being in the on state when the input and output units are clamped, and pi;k is the corresponding probability when the network is running freely. T o minimize G , it is sufficient to measure the time averaged triple co-occurence probabilities when the network is in equilibrium under the two conditions and t o change each weight according to where c scales the size of each weight change. HIGHER-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Define the energy of a k -th order Boltzmann machine as where w 7172 . . . 7t is a k -dimensional weight indices. The G matrix can be minimized by matrix symmetric on all pairs of gradient descent: where P ~ , ~ . . . is the probability of the k-tuple co-occurence of the I (s 71 ,S 72 , . . s 7r ) when the inputs and outputs are clamped, and p 7172. . . 7L is the corresponding probability when the network is freely running. In general, the energy for a Boltzmann machine is the sum over all orders of interaction and the learning algorithm is a linear combination of terms from each order. This is a Markov random field with polynomial interactions17."

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing.

                "text": "delineating the absolute indigeneity of amino acids in fossils. As AMS iechniques are refined to handle smaller samples, it may also become possible to date individual amino acid enantiomers by the \u00b0C method. If one enantiomer is entirely derived from the other by racemization during diagenesis, the individual Dp. and L-enantiomers for a given amino acid should have identical \u201cC ages. Older, more poorly preserved fossils may not always prove amenable to the determination of amino acid indigeneity by the stable isotope method, as the prospects for complete replacement of indigenous amino acids with non-indigenous amino acids increases with time. As non-indigenous amino acids undergo racemization, the enantiomers may have identical isotopic compositions and still not be related to the original organisms. Such a circumstance may, however, become easier to recognize as more information becomes available concerning the distribution and stable isotopic composition of the amino acid constituents of modern representatives of fossil organisms. Also, AMS dates on individual amino acid enantiomers may, in some cases, help to clarify indigeneity problems, in particular when stratigraphic controls can be used to estimate a general age range for the fossil in question. Finally, the development of techniques for determining the stable isotopic compasition of amino acid enantiomers may enable us to establish whether non-racemic amino acids in some carbonaceous meteorites\u201d are indigenous, or result in part from terrestrial contamination.

The model makes use of a set of Gaussian processes to model the relationship to the inputs in a nonparametric fashion. Conditional dependencies between the responses can be captured through a linear mixture of the driving processes. This feature becomes important if some of the responses of predictive interest are less densely supplied by observed data than related auxiliary ones. We propose an efficient approximate inference scheme for this semiparametric model whose complexity is linear in the number of training data points."
