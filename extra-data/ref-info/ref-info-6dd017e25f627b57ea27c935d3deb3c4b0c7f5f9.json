Recognition of mathematical expressions has been an attractive problem for the pattern recognition community because of the presence of enormous uncertainties and ambiguities as encountered during parsing of the two-dimensional structure of expressions. The goal of this competition is to bring out a state of the art for the related research. Three labs come together to organize the event and six other research groups participated the competition. The competition defines a standard format for presenting information, provides a training set of 921 expressions and supplies the underlying grammar for understanding the content of the training data. Participants were invited to submit their recognizers which were tested with a new set of 348 expressions. Systems are evaluated based on four different aspects of the recognition problem. However, the final rating of the systems is done based on their correct expression recognition accuracies. The best expression level recognition accuracy (on the test data) shown by the competing systems is 19.83% whereas a baseline system developed by one of the organizing groups reports an accuracy 22.41% on the same data set."

The proposed technique involves two major stages: symbol recognition and structural analysis. Combination of two different classifiers have been used to achieve high accuracy for the recognition of symbols. Several online and offline features are used in the structural analysis phase to identify the spatial relationships among symbols. A context-free grammar has been designed to convert the input expressions into their corresponding T/sub E/X strings which are subsequently converted into MathML format. Contextual information has been used to correct several structure interpretation errors. A new method for evaluating performance of the proposed system has been formulated. Experiments on a dataset of considerable size strongly support the feasibility of the proposed system."

Numerous approaches for recognizing handwritten math symbols have been published, but most of them are either an online approach or a hybrid approach. There is an absence of a study focused on offline features for handwritten math symbol recognition. Furthermore, many papers provide results difficult to compare. In this paper we assess the performance of several well-known offline features for this task. We also test a novel set of features based on polar histograms and the vertical repositioning method for feature extraction. Finally, we report and analyze the results of several experiments using recurrent neural networks on a large public database of online handwritten math expressions. The combination of online and offline features significantly improved the recognition rate."

We represent MEs in Context Free Grammars (CFGs) and employ the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm to parse 2D structure of on-line handwritten MEs and select the best interpretation in terms of symbol segmentation, recognition and structure analysis. We propose a method to learn structural relations from training patterns without any heuristic decisions by using two SVM models. We employ stroke order to reduce the complexity of the parsing algorithm. Moreover, we revise structure analysis. Even though CFG does not resolve ambiguities in some cases, our method still gives users a list of candidates that contain expecting result. We evaluate our method in the CROHME 2013 database and demonstrate the improvement of our system in recognition rate as well as processing time."

We compare the performance of our approach using four different classification methods: AdaBoost. M1 with C4.5 decision trees, Random Forests and Support-Vector Machines with linear and Gaussian kernels. Despite the fact that timing information can be extracted from on-line data, our feature set is based on shape description for greater tolerance to variations of the drawing process. Our main datasets come from the Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME) 2012 and 2013. Class representation bias in CROHME datasets is mitigated by generating samples for underrepresented classes using an elastic distortion model. Our results show that generation of synthetic data for underrepresented classes might lead to improvements of the average per-class accuracy. We also tested our system using the Math Brush dataset achieving a top-1 accuracy of 89.87% which is comparable with the best results of other recently published approaches on the same dataset."

The collected database consists of 419 flowcharts labeled at the stroke and symbol levels. In addition, an isolated database of graphical and text symbols was extracted from these collected flowcharts. Then, we tackle the problem of online handwritten flowchart recognition from two different points of view. Firstly, we consider that flowcharts are correctly segmented, and we propose different classifiers to perform two tasks, text/non-text separation and graphical symbol recognition. Tested with the extracted isolated test database, we achieve up to 90% and 98% in text/non-text separation and up to 93.5% in graphical symbols recognition. Secondly, we propose a global approach to perform flowchart segmentation and recognition. For this latter, we adopt a global learning schema and a recognition architecture that considers a simultaneous segmentation and recognition. Global architecture is trained and tested directly with flowcharts. Results show the interest of such global approach, but regarding the complexity of flowchart segmentation problem, there is still lot of space to improve the global learning and recognition methods."

Then, the symbol recognition step needs to cope with the identification of wrong segmented symbols (false hypotheses). However, previous works on symbol recognition consider only correctly segmented symbols. In this work, we focus on the problem of mathematical symbol recognition where false hypotheses need to be identified. We extract symbol hypotheses from complete handwritten mathematical expressions and train artificial neural networks to perform both symbol classification of true hypotheses and rejection of false hypotheses. We propose a new shape context-based symbol descriptor: fuzzy shape context. Evaluation is performed on a publicly available dataset that contains 101 symbol classes. Results show that the fuzzy shape context version outperforms the original shape context. Best recognition and false acceptance rates were obtained using a combination of shape contexts and online features: 86% and 17.5% respectively. As false rejection rate, we obtained 8.6% using only online features."

A series of experiments are presented in which a Support Vector Machine is used with these new features to classify spatial relationships of five types in the MathBrush corpus (horizontal, superscript, subscript, below, and inside (e.g. in a square root)). The normalized geometric features provide an improvement over previously published results, while the shape-based features provide a natural representation with results comparable to those for the geometric features. Combining the features produced a very small improvement in accuracy."

The handwritten mathematical expression is preprocessed and rendered to an image. Then for each stroke, we compute three kinds of shape context features (stroke pair, local neighborhood and global shape contexts) with different scales, 21 stroke pair geometric features and symbol classification scores for the current stroke and stroke pair. The stroke pair shape context features covers the current stroke and the following stroke in time series. The local neighborhood shape context features includes the current stroke and its three nearest neighbor strokes in distance while the global shape context features covers the expression. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction. We use AdaBoost with confidence weighted predictions for classification. The method does not use any language model. To our best knowledge, there is no previous work which uses shape context features for symbol segmentation. Experiment results show the new symbol segmentation method achieves good recall and precision on the CROHME 2012 dataset."

In document recognition, these target objects (e.g. symbols) are frequently comprised of multiple primitives (e.g. connected components, or strokes for online handwritten data), but current metrics do not characterize errors at the primitive level, from which object-level structure is obtained. Primitive label graphs are directed graphs defined over primitives and primitive pairs. We define new metrics obtained by Hamming distances over label graphs, which allow classification, segmentation and parsing errors to be characterized separately, or using a single measure. Recall and precision for detected objects may also be computed directly from label graphs. We illustrate the new metrics by comparing a new primitive-level evaluation to the symbol-level evaluation performed for the CROHME 2012 handwritten math recognition competition. A Python-based set of utilities for evaluating, visualizing and translating label graphs is publicly available."

The method is robust against the recognition errors of characters and the variation of the printing styles of the documents. The outline is as follows: we first construct a network with vertices representing the characters (symbols), linked with each other by several edges with labels and costs representing the possible relations of the pair of characters. The network has multiple edges with different labels and costs representing the ambiguity of the decision of the relation of character pairs. Then, we output the spanning tree of the network with minimum cost which corresponds to the recognition result of the structure of the mathematical formula, using not only the local costs initially attached to the network but the costs reflecting global structure of the formula. The advantage of this method is that local errors of the recognition are recovered automatically by the total cost of the recognition tree."

While recognition and retrieval of textual information is fairly mature, with wide-spread availability of optical character recognition and text-based search engines, recognition and retrieval of graphics such as images, figures, tables, diagrams, and mathematical expressions are in comparatively early stages of research. This paper surveys the state of the art in recognition and retrieval of mathematical expressions, organized around four key problems in math retrieval (query construction, normalization, indexing, and relevance feedback), and four key problems in math recognition (detecting expressions, detecting and classifying symbols, analyzing symbol layout, and constructing a representation of meaning). Of special interest is the machine learning problem of jointly optimizing the component algorithms in a math recognition system, and developing effective indexing, retrieval and relevance feedback algorithms for math retrieval. Another important open problem is developing user interfaces that seamlessly integrate recognition and retrieval. Activity in these important research areas is increasing, in part because math notation provides an excellent domain for studying problems common to many document and graphics recognition and retrieval applications, and also because mature applications will likely provide substantial benefits for education, research, and mathematical literacy."
