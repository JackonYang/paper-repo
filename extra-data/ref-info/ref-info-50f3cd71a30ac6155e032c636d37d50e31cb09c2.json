This is extremely challenging because of variation in pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

In previous work the Pictorial Structure Model approach has proven particularly successful, and is appealing because of its moderate computational cost. However, the accuracy of resulting pose estimates has been limited by the use of simple representations of limb appearance. We propose strong discriminatively trained limb detectors combining gradient and color segmentation cues. Our main contribution is a novel method for capturing coherent appearance properties of a limb using efficient color segmentation applied to every limb hypothesis during inference. The approach gives state-of-the-art results improving significantly on the \u201citerative image parsing\u201d method, and shows significant promise for combination with other models of pose and appearance."

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use by other researchers."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

Pose accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the part detectors but more accurate detectors are likely to be also more computationally expensive. We propose to use multiple, heterogeneous part detectors with varying accuracy and computation requirements, ordered in a hierarchy, to achieve more accurate and efficient pose estimation. For inference, we propose an algorithm to localize articulated objects by exploiting an ordered hierarchy of detectors with increasing accuracy. The inference uses branch and bound method to search for each part and use kinematics from neighboring parts to guide the branching behavior and compute bounds on the best part estimate. We demonstrate our approach on a publicly available People dataset and outperform the state-of-art methods. Our inference is 3 times faster than one based on using a single, highly accurate detector."

Interactions are modeled as occlusions between people. First, we propose an occlusion probability predictor, based on the location of persons automatically detected in the image, and incorporate the predictions as occlusion priors into our multi-person PS model. Moreover, our model includes an inter-people exclusion penalty, preventing body parts from different people from occupying the same image region. Thanks to these elements, our model has a global view of the scene, resulting in better pose estimates in group photos, where several persons stand nearby and occlude each other. In a comprehensive evaluation on a new, challenging group photo datasets we demonstrate the benefits of our multi-person model over a state-of-the-art single-person pose estimator which treats each person independently."

Numerous models have been proposed over the years and often address different special cases, such as pedestrian detection or upper body pose estimation in TV footage. This paper shows that such specialization may not be necessary, and proposes a generic approach based on the pictorial structures framework. We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using belief propagation. We demonstrate that such a model is equally suitable for both detection and pose estimation tasks, outperforming the state of the art on three recently proposed datasets."

While such models allow efficient learning and inference, they fail to capture additional dependencies between body parts, other than kinematic constraints between connected parts. In this paper, we consider the use of multiple tree models, rather than a single tree model for human pose estimation. Our model can alleviate the limitations of a single tree-structured model by combining information provided across different tree models. The parameters of each individual tree model are trained via standard learning algorithms in a single tree-structured model. Different tree models can be combined in a discriminative fashion by a boosting procedure. We present experimental results showing the improvement of our approaches on two different datasets. On the first dataset, we use our multiple tree framework for occlusion reasoning. On the second dataset, we combine multiple deformable trees for capturing spatial constraints between non-connected body parts."

                "text": "Detecting objects in cluttered scenes and estimating articulated human body parts are two challenging problems in computer vision. The difficulty is particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g. playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however, that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013 recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."

In this paper we develop a new algorithm for detecting people using poselets. Unlike that work which used 3D annotations of keypoints, we use only 2D annotations which are much easier for naive human annotators. The main algorithmic contribution is in how we use the pattern of poselet activations. Individual poselet activations are noisy, but considering the spatial context of each can provide vital disambiguating information, just as object detection can be improved by considering the detection scores of nearby objects in the scene. This can be done by training a two-layer feed-forward network with weights set using a max margin technique. The refined poselet activations are then clustered into mutually consistent hypotheses where consistency is based on empirically determined spatial keypoint distributions. Finally, bounding boxes are predicted for each person hypothesis and shape masks are aligned to edges in the image to provide a segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, the resulting system is the current best performer on the task of people detection and segmentation with an average precision of 47.8% and 40.5% respectively on PASCAL VOC 2009."

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

Typically, one fits a model by maximizing the likelihood of the part labels. Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector). Our model is general enough to find other articulated objects; we use it to recover poses of horses in the challenging Weizmann database."

To reduce the search required for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features, relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation of a face."

Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection.

We cast the problem as inference in a generative model of the image. Under this model, limb detection is expensive due to the very large number of \npossible configurations each part can assume. We make the following contributions to reduce this cost: (i) using efficient sampling from a pictorial structure proposal distribution to obtain reasonable configurations; (ii) identifying a large set of frames where correct configurations can be inferred, and using temporal tracking elsewhere. Results are reported for signing footage with changing background, challenging image conditions, and different signers; and we show that the method is able to identify the true arm and hand locations. The results exceed the state-of-the-art for the length and stability of continuous limb tracking."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

We can create such an object detector by taking the architecture of the Viola-Jones detector cascade and training it with a new variant of boosting that we call MIL-Boost. MILBoost uses cost functions from the Multiple Instance Learning literature combined with the AnyBoost framework. We adapt the feature selection criterion of MILBoost to optimize the performance of the Viola-Jones cascade. Experiments show that the detection rate is up to 1.6 times better using MILBoost. This increased detection rate shows the advantage of simultaneously learning the locations and scales of the objects in the training set along with the parameters of the classifier."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

We do this by packaging linear SVMs into a probabilistic formulation and embedding them in the mixture of experts model. The weights of the mixture model are generated by the gating network dependent on the input data. The new mixture of linear SVMs can be then trained efficiently using the EM algorithm. Unlike previous SVM-based mixture of expert models, which use a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the burden of training for large scale data sets, the main purpose of our approach is to improve the efficiency for testing. Experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve the efficiency of linear classifiers in the prediction phase while still maintaining the classification performance of nonlinear classifiers."

                "text": "the selection of symmetric factorial designs, that is, a design where all factors have the same number of levels. Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."
