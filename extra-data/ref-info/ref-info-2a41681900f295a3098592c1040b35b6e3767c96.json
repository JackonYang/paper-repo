We present IRM (Integrated Region Matching), a novel similarity measure for region-based image similarity comparison. The targeted image retrieval systems represent an image by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by features reflecting color, texture, shape, and location properties. The IRM measure for evaluating overall similarity between images incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region-matching scheme. Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, the overall similarity approach reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation, helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems. The IRM has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system. The application to a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images shows exceptional robustness to image alterations such as intensity variation, sharpness variation, color distortions, shape distortions, cropping, shifting, and rotation. Compared with several existing systems, our system in general achieves more accurate retrieval at higher speed."

We present here an implementation of NeTra, a prototype image retrieval system that uses color, texture, shape and spatial location information in segmented image regions to search and retrieve similar regions from the database. A distinguishing aspect of this system is its incorporation of a robust automated image segmentation algorithm that allows object- or region-based search. Image segmentation significantly improves the quality of image retrieval when images contain multiple complex objects. Images are segmented into homogeneous regions at the time of ingest into the database, and image attributes that represent each of these regions are computed. In addition to image segmentation, other important components of the system include an efficient color representation, and indexing of color, texture, and shape features for fast search and retrieval. This representation allows the user to compose interesting queries such as \u201cretrieve all images that contain regions that have the color of object A, texture of object B, shape of object C, and lie in the upper of the image\u201d, where the individual objects could be regions belonging to different images. A Java-based web implementation of NeTra is available at http://vivaldi.ece.ucsb.edu/Netra."

This paper describes WBIIS (Wavelet-Based Image Indexing and Searching), a new image indexing and retrieval algorithm with partial sketch image searching capability for large image databases. The algorithm characterizes the color variations over the spatial extent of the image in a manner that provides semantically meaningful image comparisons. The indexing algorithm applies a Daubechies' wavelet transform for each of the three opponent color components. The wavelet coefficients in the lowest few frequency bands, and their variances, are stored as feature vectors. To speed up retrieval, a two-step procedure is used that first does a crude selection based on the variances, and then refines the search by performing a feature vector match between the selected images and the query. For better accuracy in searching, two-level multiresolution matching may also be used. Masks are used for partial-sketch queries. This technique performs much better in capturing coherence of image, object granularity, local color/texture, and bias avoidance than traditional color layout algorithms. WBIIS is much faster and more accurate than traditional algorithms. When tested on a database of more than 10 000 general-purpose images, the best 100 matches were found in 3.3 seconds."

Unlike text-based retrieval, where keywords are successfully used to index into documents, content-based image retrieval poses up front the fundamental questions how to extract useful image features and how to use them for intuitive retrieval. We present a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of images for the purpose of image retrieval, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search. We summarize the appearance of images by distributions of color or texture features, and we define a metric between any two such distributions. This metric, which we call the \"Earth Mover''s Distance\" (EMD), represents the least amount of work that is needed to rearrange the mass is one distribution in order to obtain the other. We show that the EMD matches perceptual dissimilarity better than other dissimilarity measures, and argue that it has many desirable properties for image retrieval. Using this metric, we employ Multi-Dimensional Scaling techniques to embed a group of images as points in a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances reflect image dissimilarities as well as possible. Such geometric embeddings exhibit the structure in the image set at hand, allowing the user to understand better the result of a database query and to refine the query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user can quickly zoom in to the portion of the image space of interest. We also apply these techniques to other modalities such as mug-shot retrieval."

However, since the features in trxture, color, and shape are generated using dfierent computation methods and thus may requ-wedihent similarity measurements, the integration of the retrieval on heterogeneous features is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we present a semanticsbased clustering approach, termed SemQuery, to support visual queries on heterogeneous features of images. Using thii approach, the database images are classified based on their heterogeneous features. Each semantic image cluster contains a set of subclustem that are represented by the het~ogeneous features that the images contain. A database image is included into a feature subclnster only if the image containsall the features under the same cluster. We also designed a multi-layer model to merge the results of basic queries on individual features. A visual query processing strategy is then presented to support visual queries on heterogeneous features. ExTerirnental analysis is conducted and presented to demonstratee the effectiveness and efficiency oft he proposed approach."

Based on these groupings, effective indices can be built for an image database. The authors show how a specific high-level classification problem (city vs. landscape classification) can be solved from relatively simple low-level features suited for the particular classes. They have developed a procedure to qualitatively measure the saliency of a feature for classification problem based on the plot of the intra-class and inter-class distance distributions. They use this approach to determine the discriminative power of the following features: color histogram, color coherence vector DCT coefficient, edge direction histogram, and edge direction coherence vector. They determine that the edge direction-based features have the most discriminative power for the classification problem of interest. A weighted k-NN classifier is used for the classification. The classification system results in an accuracy of 93.9% when evaluated on an image database of 2,716 images using the leave-one-out method."

With the explosive growth of information that is available through the WWW, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the users to find the information of interest. Therefore, search engines are becoming very popular and useful. However, most of the popular search engines today are textual. Although most Web pages have images, the current image search engines on the WWW are primitive.For traditional text retrieval the only way to search for relevant documents is by specifying keywords. However, for multimedia retrieval it is essential that the user is provided with various options for retrieving the target image. AMORE allows the user to retrieve images of interest using various techniques.The effectiveness of an information retrieval engine is also dependent on the user interface to show the retrieved images. In AMORE, the retrieved images are shown using thumbnails. Like traditional WWW search engines the user can browse through pages of results. We also allow the user to click on an interesting thumbnail and retrieve similar images. This visual navigation strategy is helpful in quickly retrieving the target images. To help the user if many images are retrieved we have also developed a Query Result Visualization Environment. This interface allows the search results to be organized in various ways. We believe that the integration of information retrieval with visualization is helpful for the user's retrieval tasks."

QBIC allows queries on large image and video databases based on example images, user-constructed sketches and drawings, selected color and texture patterns, camera and object motion, and other graphical information. Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means. This article describes the QBIC system and demonstrates its query capabilities. QBIC technology is part of several IBM products. >"

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

In contrast, most currently available computer vision systems fall far short of human performance in this task, and further, they are generally not capable of being able to assert the correctness of their judgments. In computerized stereo matching systems, correctness of the similarity/identity-matching is almost never guaranteed. In this paper, we explore the question of the extent to which judgments of similarity/identity can be made essentially error-free in support of obtaining a relatively dense depth model of a natural outdoor scene. We argue for the necessity of simultaneously producing a crude scene-specific semantic \"overlay\". For our experiments, we designed a wavelet-based stereo matching algorithm and use \"classification-trees\" to create a primitive semantic overlay of the scene. A series of mutually independent filters has been designed and implemented based on the study of different error sources. Photometric appearance, camera imaging geometry and scene constraints are utilized in these filters. When tested on different sets of stereo images, our system has demonstrated above 97 correctness on asserted matches. Finally, we provide a principled basis for relatively dense depth recovery."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l(2) and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l(2) Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented."

Image content is represented by attributed relational graphs holding features of objects and relationships between objects. The method relies on the assumption that a fixed number of \"labeled\" or \"expected\" objects (e.g., \"heart\", \"lungs\", etc.) are common in all images of a given application domain in addition to a variable number of \"unexpected\" or \"unlabeled\" objects (e.g., \"tumor\", \"hematoma\", etc.). The method can answer queries by example, such as \"find all X-rays that are similar to Smith's X-ray\". The stored images are mapped to points in a multidimensional space and are indexed using state-of-the-art database methods (R-trees). The proposed method has several desirable properties: (a) Database search is approximate, so that all images up to a prespecified degree of similarity (tolerance) are retrieved. (b) It has no \"false dismissals\" (i.e., all images qualifying query selection criteria are retrieved). (c) It is much faster than sequential scanning for searching in the main memory and on the disk (i.e., by up to an order of magnitude), thus scaling-up well for large databases."

This paper describes a novel multiresolution image segmentation algorithm for low DOF images. The algorithm is designed to separate a sharply focused object-of-interest from other foreground or background objects. The algorithm is fully automatic in that all parameters are image independent. A multi-scale approach based on high frequency wavelet coefficients and their statistics is used to perform context-dependent classification of individual blocks of the image. Unlike other edge-based approaches, our algorithm does not rely on the process of connecting object boundaries. The algorithm has achieved high accuracy when tested on more than 100 low DOF images, many with inhomogeneous foreground or background distractions. Compared with he state of the art algorithms, this new algorithm provides better accuracy at higher speed."

We consider the images as points in a metric space in which we wish to move around so as to locate image neighborhoods of interest, based on color information. The data base images are mapped to distributions in color space, these distributions are appropriately compressed, and then the distances between all pairs I; J of images are computed based on the work needed to rearrange the mass in the compressed distribution representing I to that of J . We also propose the use of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques to embed a group of images as points in a twoor three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances are preserved as much as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group. In particular, displays of 2-d MDS embeddings can be used to organize and re ne the results of a nearest-neighbor query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user is able to quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest."

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling.

                "text": "Digital library access is driven by features but features are often context dependent and noisy and their relevance for a query is not always obvious This paper describes an approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive to improve its generalization ability"

We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."
