This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question, \u201cWhat is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?\u201d Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets. After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available software and provides fully automated parameter selection."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \u03c72 kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

While this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. In the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. This progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. In this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. These include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. Furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by Boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. All methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. The key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. Furthermore the Boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. We provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently."

This makes medoid shift considerably faster than mean shift, contrarily to what previously believed. We then exploit kernel methods to extend both mean shift and the improved medoid shift to a large family of distances, with complexity bounded by the effective rank of the resulting kernel matrix, and with explicit regularization constraints. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, medoid shift fails to cluster data points belonging to the same mode, resulting in over-fragmentation. We propose remedies for this problem, by introducing a novel, simple and extremely efficient clustering algorithm, called quick shift, that explicitly trades off under- and over-fragmentation. Like medoid shift, quick shift operates in non-Euclidean spaces in a straightforward manner. We also show that the accelerated medoid shift can be used to initialize mean shift for increased efficiency. We illustrate our algorithms to clustering data on manifolds, image segmentation, and the automatic discovery of visual categories."

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \\cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes."
