As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them in order to make a decision on whether to buy the product. In this project, we aim to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we are only interested in the specific features of the product that customers have opinions on and also whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting or rewriting a subset of the original sentences from the reviews to capture their main points as in the classic text summarization. In this paper, we only focus on mining opinion/product features that the reviewers have commented on. A number of techniques are presented to mine such features. Our experimental results show that these techniques are highly effective."

It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web."

Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful."

Nevertheless, certain cues can often help suggest the selection of sentences for inclusion in a summary. This paper presents our analysis of news-article summaries generated by sentence selection. Sentences are ranked for potential inclusion in the summary using a weighted combination of statistical and linguistic features. The statistical features were adapted from standard IR methods. The potential linguistic ones were derived from an analysis of news-wire summaries. To evaluate these features we use a normalized version of precision-recall curves, with a baseline of random sentence selection, as well as analyze the properties of such a baseline. We illustrate our discussions with empirical results showing the importance of corpus-dependent baseline summarization standards, compression ratios and carefully crafted long queries."

The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle nuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews."

These sorts of technologies are built around the assumptions that (1) events reported as facts in news stories should be \"understood\" as facts; (2) the style of a story, i.e., the way in which a story is told, is not of interest; and, (3) the source of a story should not influence its analysis. These assumptions are obviously unrealistic. Everyone knows that one should not believe everything in the news. But, by making these simplifying assumptions most existing story understanding systems function as gullible \"readers.\" The focus of my current research is to build a less gullible story understander by encoding in it a means to recognize point of view. The techniques that I am developing will be useful, not only for information retrieval tasks which demand a search for credible stories, but also in future entertainment technologies which will be capable of finding and then assembling together into a unified presentation a set of texts or video clips to tell a story from an ensemble of points of view."

Association rule mining finds all the rules existing in the database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. For association rule mining, the target of discovery is not pre-determined, while for classification rule mining there is one and only one predetermined target. In this paper, we propose to integrate these two mining techniques. The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs). An efficient algorithm is also given for building a classifier based on the set of discovered CARs. Experimental results show that the classifier built this way is, in general, more accurate than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5. In addition, this integration helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems."

In particular, this paper proposes an approach to multi-perspective question answering that views the task as one of opinion-oriented information extraction. We first describe an annotation scheme developed for the low-level representation of opinions, and note the results of interannotator agreement studies using the opinion-based annotation framework. Next, we propose the use of opinion-oriented \u201cscenario templates\u201d to act as a summary representation of the opinions expressed in a document, a set of documents, or an arbitrary text segment. Finally, we outline an approach for the automatic construction of opinion-based summary representations and describe how they might be used to support a variety of multi-perspective question answering tasks."

The grammatical properties discussed are preferred phrase structures: technical terms consist mostly of noun phrases containing adjectives, nouns, and occasionally prepositions; rerely do terms contain verbs, adverbs, or conjunctions. The discourse properties are patterns of repetition that distinguish noun phrases that are technical terms, especially those multi-word phrases that constitute a substantial majority of all technical vocabulary, from other types of noun phrase. The paper presents a terminology indentification algorithm that is motivated by these linguistic properties. An implementation of the algorithm is described; it recovers a high proportion of the technical terms in a text, and a high proportaion of the recovered strings are vaild technical terms. The algorithm proves to be effective regardless of the domain of the text to which it is applied."

We offer an alternative perspective on this problem, by tackling the complementary task of content characterisation; our motivation for doing so is to avoid some of the fundamental shortcomings of summarisation technologies today. Traditionally, the document summarisation task has been tackled either as a natural language processing problem, with an instantiated meaning template being rendered into coherent prose, or as a passage extraction problem, where certain fragments (typically sentences) of the source document are deemed to be highly representative of its content, and thus delivered as meaningful \u201capproximations\u201d of it. Balancing the conflicting requirements of depth and accuracy of a summary, on the one hand, and document and domain independence, on the other, has proven a very hard problem. This paper describes a novel approach to content characterisation of text documents. It is domain- and genre-independent, by virtue of not requiring an in-depth analysis of the full meaning. At the same time, it remains closer to the core meaning by choosing a different granularity of its representations (phrasal expressions rather than sentences or paragraphs), by exploiting a notion of discourse contiguity and coherence for the purposes of uniform coverage and context maintenance, and by utilising a strong linguistic notion of salience, as a more appropriate and representative measure of a document\u2019s \u201caboutness\u201d."

This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

Larger texts can then be replaced by important text excerpts, thereby simplifying the retrieval task and improving retrieval effectiveness. Passage-level evidence about the use of words in local contexts is also useful for resolving language ambiguities and improving retrieval output. Two main text decomposition strategies are introduced in this study, including a chronological decomposition into {\\em text segments}, and semantic decomposition into {\\em text themes}. The interaction between text segments and text themes is then used to characterize text structure, and to formulate specifications for information retrieval, text traversal, and text summarization."

There are numerous applications for which subjectivity tagging is relevant, including information extraction and information retrieval. This paper identifies strong clues of subjectivity using the results of a method for clustering words according to distributional similarity (Lin 1998), seeded by a small amount of detailed manual annotation. These features are then further refined with the addition of lexical semantic features of adjectives, specifically polarity and gradability (Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown 1997), which can be automatically learned from corpora. In 10-fold cross validation experiments, features based on both similarity clusters and the lexical semantic features are shown to have higher precision than features based on each alone."

A method is described for coercing sentence meanings into a metaphoric model such that the only semantic interpretation needed in order to determine the directionality of a sentence is done with respect to the model. This interpretation method is designed to be an integrated component of a hybrid information access system."

A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus."

At the heart of the debate are fundamental questions concerning the nature of language, the role of data in building a model or theory, and the impact of the competence-performance distinction on the field of computational linguistics. Currently, there is an increasing realization in both camps that the two approaches have something to offer in achieving common goals. The eight contributions in this book explore the inevitable \"balancing act\" that must take place when symbolic and statistical approaches are brought together -- including basic choices about what knowledge will be represented symbolically and how it will be obtained, what assumptions underlie the statistical model, what principles motivate the symbolic model, and what the researcher gains by combining approaches. The topics covered include an examination of the relationship between traditional linguistics and statistical methods, qualitative and quantitative methods of speech translation, study and implementation of combined techniques for automatic extraction of terminology, comparative analysis of the contributions of linguistic cues to a statistical word grouping system, automatic construction of a symbolic parser via statistical techniques, combining linguistic with statistical methods in automatic speech understanding, exploring the nature of transformation-based learning, and a hybrid symbolic/statistical approach to recovering from parser failures."

The base and lower mounting plate are further formed to be both insertable through the mounting aperture in the support surface from the exterior thereof. The lower mounting plate and upper mounting means are adapted to be clamped to the support surface by a nut threaded on the upper portion of the base. The nut is formed with a hemispherical lower portion and the upper mounting means is formed with a correspondingly shaped seat at its upper end communicating with the bore therein so that the mast can be securely mounted on the support surface at a predetermined angle thereto."

The algorithm is compared with three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs' syntax-based algorithm, Strube's S-list approach, and the BFP Centering algorithm. All four methods were implemented in a system and tested on an annotated subset of the Treebank corpus consisting of 2026 pronouns. The noteworthy results were that Hobbs and LRC performed the best."

We identify document genre is an important factor in retrieving useful documents and focus on the novel document genre dimension of subjectivity. We investigate three approaches to automatically classifying documents by genre: traditional bag of words techniques, part-of-speech statistics, and hand-crafted shallow linguistic features. We are particularly interested in domain transfer: how well the learned classifiers generalize from the training corpus to a new document corpus. Our experiments demonstrate that the part-of-speech approach is better than traditional bag of words techniques, particularly in the domain transfer conditions."
