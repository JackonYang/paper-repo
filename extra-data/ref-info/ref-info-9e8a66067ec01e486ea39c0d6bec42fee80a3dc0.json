Currently, extensive manual labor is used to annotate and organize such collections, because handwriting recognition approaches provide only poor results on old documents. In this work, we present a novel retrieval approach for historical document collections, which does not require recognition. We assume that word images can be described using a vocabulary of discretized word features. From a training set of labeled word images, we extract discrete feature vectors, and estimate the joint probability distribution of features and word labels. For a given feature vector (i.e. a word image), we can then calculate conditional probabilities for all labels in the training vocabulary. Experiments show that this relevance-based language model works very well with a mean average precision of 89% for 4-word queries on a subset of George Washington's manuscripts. We also show that this approach may be extended to general shapes by using the same model and a similar feature set to retrieve general shapes in two different shape datasets."

However, automatic conversion of handwritten manuscripts to digital form allowing eecient storage and retrieval of the original documents is a challenging problem. Word spotting is a scheme to index such data. The important steps in this scheme are segmentation of a document page into words and creation of lists containing instances of the same word by word image matching. We have developed a novel methodology for segmenting handwritten document images by analyzing the extent of \\blobs\" in a scale space representation of the image. The algorithm was been applied to around 30 grey level images randomly picked from diierent sections of the George Washington corpus of 6,400 handwritten document images. An accuracy of 77 ? 96 percent was observed with an average accuracy of around 87 percent. The algorithm works well in the presence of noise, shine through and other artifacts which may arise due aging and degradation of the page over a couple of centuries or through the man made processes of photocopying and scanning. end ital-ics mode"

Since optical character recognition (OCR) works poorly with handwriting, a scheme based on matching word images called word spotting has been suggested previously for indexing such documents. The important steps in this scheme are segmentation of a document page into words and creation of lists containing instances of the same word by word image matching. \n \nWe have developed a novel methodology for segmenting handwritten document images by analyzing the extent of \"blobs\" in a scale space representationof the image. We believe this is the first application of scale space to this problem. The algorithm has been applied to around 30 grey level images randomly picked from Different sections of the George Washington corpus of 6,400 handwritten document images. An accuracy of 77-96 percent was observed with an average accuracy of around 87 percent. The algorithm works well in the presence of noise, shine through and other artifacts which may arise due aging and degradation of the page over a couple of centuries or through the man made processes of photocopying and scanning."

However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents)."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. We argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. This suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. However, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. Furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. Instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. We estimate models for each document individually. Our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. One advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model. We have implemented our model and tested it empirically. Our approach significantly outperforms standard tf.idf weighting on two different collections and query sets."

Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language. The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework. We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary. We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9. The model achieves performance around 95% of the strong mono-lingual baseline in terms of average precision. In initial precision, our model outperforms the mono-lingual baseline by 20%. The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

We describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models which aim to describe such data, culminating in correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation, a latent variable model that is effective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type. We conduct experiments on the Corel database of images and captions, assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood, automatic annotation, and text-based image retrieval."
