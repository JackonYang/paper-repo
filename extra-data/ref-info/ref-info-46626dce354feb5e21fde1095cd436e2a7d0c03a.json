This problem is challenging due to the high dimensional state space of body poses, the presence of pose ambiguity, and the need to segment the human body in an image. We use an image generative approach by modeling the human kinematics, the shape and the clothing probabilistically. These models are used for deriving a good likelihood measure to evaluate samples in the solution, space. We adopt a data-driven MCMC framework for searching the solution space efficiently. Our observation data include the face, head-shoulders contour, skin color blobs, and ridges; and they provide evidences on the positions of the head, shoulders and limbs. To translate these inferences into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of 'proposal maps', which is an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates during the MCMC search. As experimental results show, the proposed technique estimates the human 3D pose accurately on various test images."

The kinematic constraints implied by the model's joints have a probabilistic structure which is well described by a graphical model. Inference in this model is complicated by the hand's many degrees of freedom, as well as multimodal likelihoods caused by ambiguous image measurements. We use nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) to develop a tracking algorithm which exploits the graph's structure to control complexity, while avoiding costly discretization. \n \nWhile kinematic constraints naturally have a local structure, self- occlusions created by the imaging process lead to complex interpendencies in color and edge-based likelihood functions. However, we show that local structure may be recovered by introducing binary hidden variables describing the occlusion state of each pixel. We augment the NBP algorithm to infer these occlusion variables in a distributed fashion, and then analytically marginalize over them to produce hand position estimates which properly account for occlusion events. We provide simulations showing that NBP may be used to refine inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences."

Without assuming a priori knowledge of scale, pose or appearance, this problem is extremely challenging and demands the use of all possible sources of information. We develop a framework which can incorporate arbitrary pairwise constraints between body parts, such as scale compatibility, relative position, symmetry of clothing and smooth contour connections between parts. We detect candidate body parts from bottom-up using parallelism, and use various pairwise configuration constraints to assemble them together into body configurations. To find the most probable configuration, we solve an integer quadratic programming problem with a standard technique using linear approximations. Approximate IQP allows us to incorporate much more information than the traditional dynamic programming and remains computationally efficient. 15 hand-labeled images are used to train the low-level part detector and learn the pairwise constraints. We show test results on a variety of images."

The human body configuration is modeled by a Markov network and the estimation problem is to infer pose parameters from image cues such as appearance, shape, edge, and color. From a set of hand labeled images, we accumulate prior knowledge of 2D body shapes by learning their low-dimensional representations for inference of pose parameters. A data driven belief propagation Monte Carlo algorithm, utilizing importance sampling functions built from bottom-up visual cues, is proposed for efficient probabilistic inference. Contrasted to the few sequential statistical formulations in the literature, our algorithm integrates both top-down as well as bottom-up reasoning mechanisms, and can carry out the inference tasks in parallel. Experimental results demonstrate the potency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating 2D human pose from single images."

Unlike traditional kinematic tree representations, our model of the body is a collection of loosely-connected limbs. Conditional probabilities relating the 3D pose of connected limbs are learned from motion-captured training data. Similarly, we learn probabilistic models for the temporal evolution of each limb (forward and backward in time). Human pose and motion estimation is then solved with non-parametric belief propagation using a variation of particle filtering that can be applied over a general loopy graph. The loose-limbed model and decentralized graph structure facilitate the use of low-level visual cues. We adopt simple limb and head detectors to provide \"bottom-up\" information that is incorporated into the inference process at every time-step; these detectors permit automatic initialization and aid recovery from transient tracking failures. We illustrate the method by automatically tracking a walking person in video imagery using four calibrated cameras. Our experimental apparatus includes a marker-based motion capture system aligned with the coordinate frame of the calibrated cameras with which we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our 3D person tracker."

While such models can effectively represent the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure, they do not capture additional constraints such as coordination of the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss an important source of information about human body pose, as limb coordination is necessary for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being evident in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this paper, we consider the use of undirected graphical models that augment a tree structure with latent variables in order to account for coordination between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor models, since they are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional correlations in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree structure. These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure and thus a variant of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can be applied for efficient estimation. We present some experimental results contrasting common-factor models with tree models, and quantify the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: besides the difficulty of matching an imperfect, highly flexible, self-occluding model to cluttered image features, realistic body models have at least 30 joint parameters subject to highly nonlinear physical constraints, and at least a third of these degrees of freedom are nearly unobservable in any given monocular image. For image matching we use a carefully designed robust cost metric combining robust optical flow, edge energy, and motion boundaries. The nonlinearities and matching ambiguities make the parameter-space cost surface multimodal, ill-conditioned and highly nonlinear, so searching it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers, and describe a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled sampling and robust continuous optimization subject to physical constraints and model priors. Our experiments on challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modeling, joint and self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable monocular 3D motion estimation."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

Moving people are modeled with the assumption that, while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c) recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image. We use this segmentation approach to build limb and torso detectors, the outputs of which are assembled into human figures. We present quantitative results on torso localization, in addition to shortlisted full body configurations."

We define a \"card-board person model\" in which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences."

                "text": "In many applications of graphical models arising in computer vision, the hidden variables of interest are most naturally specified by continuous, non-Gaussian distributions. There exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional variables typically of interest, discrete inference becomes infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accommodate an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model, allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features."

As the state-space of a model grows, the dependencies between the dimensions lead to an exponential growth in computation when performing inference. Many common computer vision problems naturally map onto the graphical model framework; the representation is a graph where each node contains a portion of the state-space and there is an edge between two nodes only if they are not independent conditional on the other nodes in the graph. When this graph is sparsely connected, belief propagation algorithms can turn an exponential inference computation into one, which is linear in the size of the graph. However belief propagation is only applicable when the variables in the nodes are discrete-valued or jointly represented by a single multivariate Gaussian distribution, and this rules out many computer vision applications. This paper combines belief propagation with ideas from particle filtering; the resulting algorithm performs inference on graphs containing both cycles and continuous-valued latent variables with general conditional probability distributions. Such graphical models have wide applicability in the computer vision domain and we test the algorithm on example problems of low-level edge linking and locating jointed structures in clutter."

We pose this problem as a \"model-based segmentation\" problem in which human shape models are used to interpret the foreground in a Bayesian framework. The solution is obtained by using an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that uses domain knowledge as proposal probabilities. Knowledge of various aspects including human shape, human height, camera model, and image cues including human head candidates, foreground/background separation are integrated in one theoretically sound framework. We show promising results and evaluations on some challenging data."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

The algorithm uses a continuation principle, based on annealing, to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently. A mechanism for achieving a soft partitioning of the search space is described and implemented, and shown to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance. Likewise, the introduction of a crossover operator is shown to improve the effectiveness of the search for kinematic trees (such as a human body).
