This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

Therefore, good paper-computer interfaces are necessary to transform paper documents into an electronic form, which allows the use of a filing and retrieval system. An electronic document page is an optically scanned and digitized representation of a printed page. Document analysis is the problem of interpreting and labeling the constitutents of the document. Although there are very reliable optical character recognition (OCR) methods, the process could be very inefficient. To prune the search space and to become more efficient, some search supporting methods have to be developed. This article proposes an approach to identify the layout of a document page by dividing it recursively into nested rectangular areas. The procedure is used as a basis for a document layout model, which is able to control an automatic interpretation mechanism for deriving a high level representation of the contents of a document. We have implemented our method in Common Lisp on a Symbolies 3640 Workstation and have run it for a large population of office documents. The results obtained have been very encouraging and have convincingly confirmed the soundness of our approach."

The principal components of the method are extraction of logical structure elements using a rectangular set operation and generation of hierarchical links of the logical structure between the extracted document elements. It is shown experimentally that the logical structure of a technical paper can be extracted.<<ETX>>"

In particular, the two problems of incorporating illustrations and laying out tables are treated in depth. The notion of style, a way of maintaining consistency in a document, runs throughout the thesis. It helps manage the complexities of formatting both illustrations and tables. The thesis reviews the history of document composition systems, including early computer typesetting systems, document compilers, and integrated document composition systems. The concept of graphical style is introduced to extend the more traditional notion of document style to illustrations. The observation that graphical style does not adequately deal with the layout problem for illustrations leads to the investigation of a more concentrated layout problem for the special case of table formatting. A grid system is used to describe the table layout arrangement and a constraint solver provides the general layout engine for formatting tables as well as the basis for future interactive table design tools. Further research based on the style and table formatting models can be extended to mathematical typesetting and full page layout. A glossary of typesetting terms and an index to the thesis are provided to help the reader deal with the typographic terminology used in the thesis."
