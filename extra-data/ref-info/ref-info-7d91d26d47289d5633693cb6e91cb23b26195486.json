Employing a kinematic hand model, the DigitEyes system has demonstrated tracking performance at speeds of up to 10 Hz, using line and point features extracted from gray scale images of unadorned, unmarked hands.

The coordinates of these objects are fed to a computer, the second level of the system, that analyses the movement of these objects with the aid of a set of rules representing the knowledge of the context. The system was extensively tested on the field and the main results are reported. The whole system can work as a controlling device in robotics or as a general real-time image processor as well as an automatic movement analyser in biomechanics, orthopedic and neurological medicine."

We have developed a set of techniques for analyzing the patterns generated by people walking across the field of view. After change detection, the XYT pattern can be fit with a smooth spatiotemporal surface. This surface is approximately periodic, reflecting the periodicity of the gait. The surface can be expressed as a combination of a standard parameterized surface-the canonical walk-and a deviation surface that is specific to the individual walk.<<ETX>>"

The need for this book is twofold. First, although linear estimation theory is relatively well known, it is largely scattered in the journal literature and has not been collected in a single source. Second, available literature on the continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial, and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor as he felt was consistent with the prime objective\" to explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise that everyone knows how to average. As a result, the author only requires of the reader background in advanced calculus, theory of ordinary differential equations, and matrix analysis."
