Forty\u2010five percent of the neurons in striate cortex responded best to oriented line stimuli moving over their receptive fields; they were classified as simple (17%), complex (25%) and hypercomplex (3%). Of all preferred orientations horizontal was most common. Fifty\u2010five percent of receptive fields were cicularly symmetric: these were on\u2010center (25%), off\u2010center (7%) and homogeneous on\u2010off in type (23%). Optimal stimulus velocities were much higher than those reported in the cat, mostly varying between 20\u00b0 and 300\u00b0/sec. The field of vision common to the two eyes projected to more than one\u2010third of the striate cortex. Although the contralateral eye provided the dominating influence on cells in this binocular area, more than two\u2010thirds of cells could also be driven through the ipsilateral eye. The topography of area 17 was similar to that found in other mammals: the upper visual field projected posteriorly, the most nasal part mapped onto the lateral border. Here the projection did not end at the vertical meridian passing through the animal's long axis, but proceeded for at least 10\u00b0 into the ipsilateral hemifield of vision, so that at least 20\u00b0 of visual field were represented in both hemispheres. The magnification in area 17 was rather uniform throughout the visual field. In an area latral to area 17 (18a) the fields were projected in condensed mirror image fashion with respect to the arrangement of area 17. Medial to area 17 a third visual area (area 18) was again related to 17 as a condensed mirror image."

                "text": "THE RECEPTORS AND NERVE CELLS that make up the visual pathway must convey and interpret information on both the form and the color of retinal images. In higher mammals little is known about the degree to which nerve cells are specialized for handling these types of information. In a visual stimulus the importance of spatial attributes, and especially of dark-light contours, first became obvious with the discovery by Hartline (20 ) of lateral inhibition in the Limulus, a type of study that was extended to mammals when Kuffler (28) demonstrated t,hat the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells in the cat are subdivided into a center and an opponent surround. The opponent principle, in which spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory regions are pitted against each other, has now been observed for retinal ganglion cells in the frog (1), the lizard (9), the rabbit (3), the rat (4), the ground squirrel (33), and the monkey (24). Similar effects have been seen in the lateral genie ulate bod .y and visual cortex in the cat (23, 25, 26), and also recently at these levels in the monkey. In 1958 De Valois and his collaborators (15) observed geniculate cells in the macaque monkey that were excited by one set of wavelengths and inhibited by another, making it apparent that in higher mammals the spectral composition of the stimulus was also an important variable. Similar opponent-color effects have since been described in the primate at the level of the retin .a1 ganglion cell (24), and in the visual cortex (34). I n the cat the absence or rarity of oppon .ent-color mecha nisms (19, 36 > may be related to an inferior ability to discriminate color (31, 32, 40); indeed since Svaetichin\u2019s (41) original observation of opponent-color responses in the fish retina (Spotentials), similar response patterns have been seen only in animals thought to have good color vision. Given the existence of two opponent mechanisms system, one for the spatial variable and the other for in the monkey visual color, it is natural to ask whether these occupy the same channels, or are confined to separate groups of cells. In the goldfish it is clear from the work of Wagner, MacNichol, and Wolbarsht (43, 45) that opponent-color and opponent-spatial"

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

This of course has a psychophysical parallel in the greatly heightened visual acuity in the foveal region compared with the periphery. From all ofthis it is only to be expected that the neural machinery necessary to take care of one square degree of fovea should be much more massive than that subserving the same area of visual field periphery. In the retina the difference is obvious histologically. Figure 7, plate 5, shows that near the primate fovea the ganglion cell layer is many cells thick, whereas peripherally there are not enough cells to make up a single continuous layer (Van Buren 1963). In the cortex one might similarly expect a relative thickening in parts subserving regions of visual field in or near the fovea, but if there is any at all it is so subtle that careful control of plane of sectioning would be required to be certain of it: certainly there is no variation in thickness remotely approaching what is seen in the layer of retinal ganglion cells. The cortex, in fact, finds an entirely different way of devoting proportionately more machinery to central visual field areas than to peripheral. The amount of retinal surface devoted to a degree of visual-field is of course constant; it must be for obvious optical reasons. In the cortex the corresponding amount of surface is far from constant, being large in the foveal region and falling off progressively as eccentricity increases. This variation in magnification (mm cortex/degree visual field) was first systematically analysed by Daniel & Whitteridge (1961). Magnification in fact seems to vary with eccentricity in such a way as to guarantee a uniform thickness of cortex (Hubel & Wiesel 1974b)."

These are termed 'circularly symmetric', 'simple', 'complex' and' hypercomplex'. We assume that cells at each stage receive their major input from cells at the previous stage, with the circularly symmetric cells receiving their inputs predominantly from geniculate cells. Circularly symmetric cells, as their name implies, show no preference to any particular orientation of lines, and, indeed, seem similar in their properties to geniculate cells. Simple cells are the first in the hierarchy to show orientation specificity, so that the rearrangements responsible for orientation specificity are presumed to take place between the circularly symmetric and the simple cells. A simple cell responds to an optimally oriented line in some narrowly defined position: even a slight displacement of the line to a new position, without change in orientation, renders the line ineffective. A complex cell, on the contrary, is probably just as specific in its orientation requirements as the simple cell, but is far less particular about the exact positioning of the line. Such a cell will respond wherever a line is projected within a rectangle such as that of figure 3; if the cell responds to a dark or light line (rather than to an edge), increasing the line's thickness beyond some value that is far less than the width of the receptive field renders it ineffective. Thus a patch of light as large as the entire receptive field evokes no response at all. This is equivalent to saying that diffuse light is ineffective. As mentioned above, sweeping the line over the receptive field usually evokes a sustained discharge from the cell. Hypercomplex cells, finally, resemble complex cells in all respects but one: extending a line beyond the region from which responses are evoked produces a marked reduction or complete abolition of the response. A few years ago Bishop & Henry (1972) described in cat cortex a type of cell whose properties resembled those of sim pIe cells, except that extending the line led to a drop in the response.

If, however, one eye of a newborn kitten is sewn shut and the visual cortex recorded from 3 months later, only a small fraction of cells can be driven from the deprived eye (8) . In contrast, many cells in the latera .I geniculate are driven normally from the d ,eprived eye (7 ), suggesting that the abnormality occurs somewhere between geniculate cells and cortex. Since clear receptive-field orientations and directional preferences to movement are seen in cortical cells of newborn visually inexperienced kittens, the deprivation effects presumably represent some sort of disruption of innately determined connections, rather than a failure of postnatal development related to lack of experience. In these experiments the use of monocular deprivation made it possible to compare adjacent geniculate layers, and also to compare the two eyes in their ability to influence cortical cells, so that each animal acted, in a sense, as its own control. The results led us to expect that depriving both eyes for similar periods would lead to an almost total unresponsiveness of cortical cells to stimulation of either eye. That should be so, provided the effects of depriving one eye were independent of whether or not the other eye was simultaneously deprived. It seemed worthwhile to test such an assumption, since any interdependence of the two pathways would be of considerable interest. We accordingly raised kittens with both eyes covered by lid suture, and recorded from the striate cortex when the animals had reached an age of 23-43 months."

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field. We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1959)."

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico\u2010cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate, cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers."

Receptive fields of these units were mapped out, in the light-adapted state, with small sports of light. In their general arrangement geniculate receptive fields resembled those of retinal ganglion cells, having an excitatory ('on') centre and inhibitory ('off') preriphery, or reverse. The two portions of a receptive field were mutually antagonistic; the decrease in centre responses cauded by inclusion of peripheral portions of receptive fields was termed peripheral suppression. Cells recorded in layers A and B of the lateral geniculate body were driven from the contralateral eye; cells in layer A1 from the ipsilateral eye. In penetrations normal to the layers receptive fields of cells in a single layer were close together or superimposed, and from one layer to the next occupied exactly homologous positions in the two retinas. Binocular interaction was not observed in any of the cells studied. All three layers of the lateral geniculate contained both 'on'-centre and 'off'-centre units. Cells in layers A and A1 were similar both in their firing patterns and in average receptive field size. Cells in layer B were more sluggish in their responses to light stimuli, and tended to have larger receptive field centres. Cells with receptive fields within or near the area centralis tended to have smaller field centres and stronger suppression by the receptive field periphery than cells with their fields situated in more peripheral regions of the retina."

Recordings were made from area 17 in two macaque monkeys three and four weeks of age, whose eyes had been closed near the time of birth. The first monkey was born normally, but one day elapsed before eye closure could be done. The second was delivered by Cesarean section and the lids sutured shut immediately. The results in these two animals were very similar; in both, highly ordered sequences of orientation shifts were present, and were in no obvious way different from those seen in the adult. For example, average values for the size of orientation shifts, for the horizontal component of the distance between shifts, and for the slopes of orientation vs. track distance curves, were all similar to adult values. This indicates that the ordered column system is innately determined and not the result of early visual experience. In these two monkeys and a third one, sutured at two days and examined at 38 days, most of the cells seemed normal by adult standards, with simple, complex or hypercomplex receptive fields, showing about the same range in orientation specificity as is found in adults. About 10\u201315% of cells showed abnormalities similar to those seen in monkeys binocularly deprived of vision for longer periods. Furthermore, all three deprived monkeys showed a decided lack of cells that could be influenced from both eyes, whereas a normal three\u2010week\u2010old control animal seemed similar to the adult, with binocular cells comprising over half of the total population. A monkey deprived by binocular closure from the third to the seventh week also showed a diminution in number of binocularly influenced cells, suggesting that the deprivation from birth resulted in a deterioration of innate connections subserving binocular convergence. To be sure that the abnormalities in the deprived animals represented a deterioration of connections, we recorded from 23 cells in a normal two\u2010day\u2010old monkey: here the ocular dominance distribution of cells was about the same as in the adult, and the response characteristics of the cells were normal by adult standards."

                "text": "Ocular dominance columns were examined by a variety of techniques in juvenile macaque monkeys in which one eye had been removed or sutured closed soon after birth. In two monkeys the removal was done at 2 weeks and the cortex studied at 1\\frac{1}{2} years. Physiological recordings showed continuous responses as an electrode advanced along layer IVC in a direction parallel to the surface. Examination of the cortex with the Fink-Heimer modification of the Nauta method after lesions confined to single lateral-geniculate layers showed a marked increase, in layer IVC, in the widths of columns belonging to the surviving eye, and a corresponding shrinkage of those belonging to the removed eye. Monocular lid closures were made in one monkey at 2 weeks of age, for a period of 18 months, in another at 3 weeks for 7 months, and in a third at 2 days for 7 weeks. Recordings from the lateral geniculate body showed brisk activity from the deprived layers and the usual abrupt eye transitions at the boundaries between layers. Cell shrinkage in the deprived layers was moderate - far less severe than that following eye removal, more marked ipsilaterally than contralaterally, and more marked the earlier the onset of the deprivation. In autoradiographs following eye injection with a mixture of tritiated proline and tritiated fucose the labelling of terminals was confined to geniculate layers corresponding to the injected eye. Animals in which the open eye was injected showed no hint of invasion of terminals into the deprived layers. Similarly in the tectum there was no indication of any change in the distribution of terminals from the two eyes. The autoradiographs of the lateral geniculates provide evidence for several previously undescribed zones of optic nerve terminals, in addition to the six classical subdivisions. In the cortex four independent methods, physiological recording, transneuronal autoradiography, Nauta degeneration, and a reduced-silver stain for normal fibres, all agreed in showing a marked shrinkage of deprived-eye columns and expansion of those of the normal eye, with preservation of the normal repeat distance (left-eye column plus right-eye column). There was a suggestion that changes in the columns were more severe when closure was done at 2 weeks as opposed to 3, and more severe on the side ipsilateral to the closure. The temporal crescent representation in layer IVC of the hemisphere opposite the closure showed no obvious adverse effects. Cell size and packing density in the shrunken IVth layer columns seemed normal. In one normal monkey in which an eye was injected the day after birth, autoradiographs of the cortex at 1 week indicated only a very mild degree of segregation of input from the two eyes; this had the form of parallel bands. Tangential recordings in layer IVC at 8 days likewise showed considerable overlap of inputs, though some segregation was clearly present; at 30 days the segregation was much more advanced. These preliminary experiments thus suggest that the layer IVC columns are not fully developed until some weeks after birth. Two alternate possibilities are considered to account for the changes in the ocular dominance columns in layer IVC following deprivation. If one ignores the above evidence in the newborn and assumes that the columns are fully formed at birth, then after eye closure the afferents from the normal eye must extend their territory, invading the deprived-eye columns perhaps by a process of sprouting of terminals. On the other hand, if at birth the fibres from each eye indeed occupy all of lay IVC, retracting to form the columns only during the first 6 weeks or so, perhaps by a process of competition, then closure of one eye may result in a competitive disadvantage of the terminals from that eye, so that they retract more than they would normally. This second possibility has the advantage that it explains the critical period for deprivation effects in the layer IV columns, this being the time after birth during which retraction is completed. It would also explain the greater severity of the changes in the earlier closures, and would provide an interpretation of both cortical and geniculate effects in terms of of competition of terminals in layer IVC for territory on postsynaptic cells."

These three neuron groups show different distributions in depth from pia to white matter and differ in their relationship to zones of concentrated termination of geniculo\u2010cortical axons. The neuron type most closely related to the laminae receiving a heavy geniculo\u2010cortical projection is the spinous stellate cell. This cell type is restricted to lamina IV. Included in this zone is the broadest band of geniculo\u2010cortical axon projection (lamina IVC), the horizontal fiber band (lamina IVB) comprising the major portion of the stria of Gennari (receiving little or no thalamic projection) and the narrow band of thalamo\u2010cortical fiber termination which occurs superficial to the stria of Gennari (lamina IVA). Pyramidal neuron cell bodies are almost totally excluded from lamina IVC and the apical dendrites of lower pyramidal neurons bear many fewer spines in lamina IVC than in laminae V and VI. The basal dendrites of upper pyramidal cells spread superficial and deep to lamina IVA rather than within it. Spine\u2010free stellate neurons occur at all cortical levels and sparselyspined varieties have not been impregnated in lamina IV, but occur in the other laminae."

He described a woman suffering from blindness of the lower left quadrants of both visual fields who was subsequently found to have a lesion limited to the dorsal half of the right LGN. Actually these early observations are not in accord with the later experimental studies on primates by Brouwer and subsequent workers (see below). Further early human clinico-pathological observations were made by Wilbrand & Saenger (1904), Ronne (1913, 1914) and Winkler (1912), but the extreme rarity of sufficiently restricted lesions, particularly in the nucleus itself, made it unlikely that the details of the retinotopic projection in the LGN would be unravelled in this way. By enucleating the eye of a cat and studying the distribution of the secondary degeneration in each LGN, Minkowski (1913) provided the first direct experimental evidence that the crossed and uncrossed optic fibres were distributed differently in the nucleus (cf. Minkowski, 1920) and that the binocular part of a visual field projected only to the medial part. The first detailed study of the retinotopic projection in the LGN was, however, carried out by Brouwer and his colleagues (Brouwer, Zeeman & Houwer, 1923). By making small retinal lesions and subsequently studying the degenerating fibres in Marchi preparations they established the quadrantic projections ofthe retina in the rabbit and cat and the quadrantic and intraquandrantic projections of the central and peripheral retinal segments in the monkey (Brouwer & Zeeman, 1925, 1926; Overbosch, 1927). Further details in respect to the monkey were added by Brody (1934), Penman"

However, the precise disposition of its component laminae in a three-dimensional sense is difficult to grasp by reference to sections, even when these are available in several planes. To overcome this difficulty, and in order to facilitate further studies of this visual centre, it was decided to make a wax reconstruction model. The serial sections of the geniculate body were also used for making a computation of its cell content. Further, in order to arrive at an estimate of the number of cells Which project on to a unit area of the visual cortex, a preliminary operation had been carried out in which a small lesion of known dimensions was made in the striate area. This led to a circumscribed area of retrograde degeneration in the lateral geniculate body from which it was possible to estimate the number of cells affected."

First, relay cells of the LGNd have either onor off-center receptive fields (16), because each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either onor off-center retinal ganglion cells (6, 16). Second, retinal ganglion cells fall into two groups (X-cells and Y-cells) according to whether they sum the influences of the center and surround regions of their receptive fields linearly or nonlinearly (8). Most LGNd relay cells can be similarly classified because most receive direct excitatory drive from either Xor Y-type retinal ganglion cells (6). Third, each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either fastor slow-conducting retinal afferents, and its own axon is correspondingly either fast or slow conducting (6, 36). The two latter parameters are closely correlated since Y-cells have been shown to have fast axons and Xcells, slow axons (6, 11). The on/off organization is independent of the other two parameters, however. Roth Y-cells and Xcells can have either onor off-center fields. This report examines several features of the LGNd relay in the normal cat, extending previous concepts and establishing a spectrum of normal properties against which the properties of the LGNd in deprived cats (described in the following paper (3W can be compared. First, the separate relay in the LGNd of the Xand Y-cell activity of the retina is described. Second, several properties of Xand Y-cells of the LGNd were observed to vary con-"

The results suggest that connections between geniculate and striate cortex, and between cortical cells, must be highly specific (5). Indeed, cells in the striate cortex respond in such a characteristic way that departures from the normal adult physiology should be easily recognizable. In the present study we have made similar experiments in kittens ranging in age from l-3 weeks. Our purpose was to learn the age at which cortical cells have normal, adult-type receptive fields, and to find out whether such fields exist even in animals that have had no patterned visual stimulation."

All fields mapped with white light had a concentric arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated 'on' centre surrounded by an antagonistic 'off' periphery, or the reverse. The smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina) and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2 degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an 'on' response and light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an 'off' response. Transition between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this wave-length evoked only feebel 'off' responses. Very weak responses were obtained to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long wavelengths. (Author)"

The first retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are generated around E30 preceding by a few days the onset of genesis of neurones destined for the dorsal lateral geniculate body (LGd) and superior colliculus (SC) both of which begin at E36. Production of neurons destined for the primary visual cortex (area 17) begins at approximately E43 and ends by E102. Neurons destined for layer IV, the major target of axons from the LGd, are generated between E70 and E85. The prenatal development of visual connections was studied by the autoradiographic method of anterograde axoplasmic transport in foetuses killed 14 days after unilateral eye injection of a mixture of [3H]proline and [3H]fucose. Initially, in the LGd and in the SC projections from both eyes overlap. Segregation of the axons and/or terminals from the two eyes occurs in the LGd and SC during the middle period of gestation. Transneuronal transport of tritium shows that although LGd axons form the optic radiation before E78, these fibres do not yet enter the developing cortical plate at this foetal age. During the second half of gestation, geniculocortical axons carrying input from each eye invade the cortex but are not yet segregated into ocular dominance columns. Rather, grains are distributed uniformly over the entire layer IV at E124. Three weeks before birth, at E144, segregation of afferents into sublayers IVA and IVC is apparent, and the first hint of ocular dominance columns is displayed by slight differences in grain counts in alternating areas of layer IV. These results show that all neurons in the primate visual system have been generated, reached their final positions and formed their basic connections subserving ocular dominance before birth, i.e. before visual experience. In the SC and LGD, monocular segregation is well established during the middle period of gestation, whereas in the cortex it has begun, but is not fully developed at birth."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

However, these changes were seen in the medial parts of the contralateral lamina A only. The lateral parts, which extend beyond the border of lamina A1 and which project to the monocular parts of the visual cortex showed no change. These results show that some geniculate cells are not affected by deprivation.

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

                "text": "Appreciation of the form of the retinal image depends upon a correspondence between the distribution of light on the retina and the distribution of activity among the fibers of the optic nerve. This correspondence may be studied directly by recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers in response to illuminating various parts of the retina. A given optic nerve fiber responds to light only if a particular region of the retina receives illumination. This region is termed the receptive field of that fiber. In a previous paper describing the responses in single optic nerve fibers from the cold-blooded vertebrate eye (Hartline, 1938) it was noted that the receptive fields of the optic nerve fibers are of small but appreciable extent, and that their locations on the retina are fixed. It is the purpose of the present paper to describe further the characteristics of receptive fields, and to discuss some of the spatial factors involved in the excitation of the fibers of the optic nerve. METHOD. The method for recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers from the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates has been described in the previous paper (lot. cit.). An eye is excised, cut open, and small bundles of optic nerve fibers are dissected from the anterior surface of the exposed retina. The action potentials in these bundles are amplified and recorded with an oscillograph. When such a bundle has been split successfully , until only a single active fiber remains, the retina must be searched with a small spot of light to determine the region supplying that fiber. This search is aided by noting the direction, on the retina, from which the nerve fibers in the small bundle come, and by using large spots of light at first to locate the approximate position of the sensitive region. The optical system employed in these experiments has likewise been described. A spot of light of suitable size is projected upon the exposed retina; the coordinates of its position, referred to an arbitrary point of origin on the retina, are obtained from readings of crossed micrometers which control its location. The micrometer readings are reduced to millimeters on the retina by multiplying them by the magnification of the optical system (0.32 or 0.15). Sharpness of focus of the spot on the retina 690"

After injection, the animals were sacrificed at varying time intervals from 4\u00bd minutes to 32 days. Serial sections of the brain were subjected to radioautography. The optic fibers were thereby traced to their known terminations and to a small thalamic cell cluster to which we found no reference in the literature. Significant differential radioactivity was detectable in the contralateral optic lobe as early as six hours postinjection, suggesting a flow, whether intra\u2010 or extraaxonal, of at least 10\u201322 mm/day."
