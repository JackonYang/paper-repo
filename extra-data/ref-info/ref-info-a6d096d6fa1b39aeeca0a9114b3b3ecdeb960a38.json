If S_{n} denotes the subject's capital after n bets at 27 for 1 odds, and if it is assumed that the subject knows the underlying probability distribution for the process X , then the entropy estimate is \\hat{H}_{n}(X)=(1-(1/n) \\log_{27}S_{n}) \\log_{2} 27 bits/symbol.

Moreover, if X is ergodic, then by the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem \\hat{H}_{n}(X)\\rightarrowH(X) with probability one.
