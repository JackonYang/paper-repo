We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors."

The optimal decision surface of a SVM is constructed from its support vectors which are conventionally determined by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem. However, solving a large optimization problem is challenging since it is computationally intensive and the memory requirement grows with square of the training vectors. In this paper, we propose a geometric method to extract a small superset of support vectors, which we call guard vectors, to construct the optimal decision surface. Specifically, the guard vectors are found by solving a set of linear programming problems. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed method is more efficient than conventional methods using QPs and requires much less memory."

Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm."

The basic problem treated is one that does not allow classification violations. The problem is converted to a problem of computing the nearest point between two convex polytopes. The suitability of two classical nearest point algorithms, due to Gilbert, and Mitchell et al., is studied. Ideas from both these algorithms are combined and modified to derive our fast algorithm. For problems which require classification violations to be allowed, the violations are quadratically penalized and an idea due to Cortes and Vapnik and Friess is used to convert it to a problem in which there are no classification violations. Comparative computational evaluation of our algorithm against powerful SVM methods such as Platt's sequential minimal optimization shows that our algorithm is very competitive."

SMO differs from most SVM algorithms in that it does not require a quadratic programming solver. In this work, we generalize SMO so that it can handle regression problems. However, one problem with SMO is that its rate of convergence slows down dramatically when data is non-sparse and when there are many support vectors in the solution\u2014as is often the case in regression\u2014because kernel function evaluations tend to dominate the runtime in this case. Moreover, caching kernel function outputs can easily degrade SMO's performance even more because SMO tends to access kernel function outputs in an unstructured manner. We address these problems with several modifications that enable caching to be effectively used with SMO. For regression problems, our modifications improve convergence time by over an order of magnitude."

The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms."

In particular, we emphasize the importance of establishing and maintaining symmetric quasidefiniteness of the reduced KKT system. We show that the industry standard MPS format can be nicely formulated in such a way to provide quasidefiniteness. Computational results are included for a variety of linear and quadratic programming problems."
