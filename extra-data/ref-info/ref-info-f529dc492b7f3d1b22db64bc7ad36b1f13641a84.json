We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model."

                "text": "Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task."

The SICK data set was used in SemEval-2014 Task 1, and it freely available for research purposes."

Our model significantly outperforms the rivals on the task of reconstructing AN vectors not seen in training. A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show moreover that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task."

However, they cannot capture the compositional meaning of longer phrases, preventing them from a deeper understanding of language. We introduce a recursive neural network (RNN) model that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Our model assigns a vector and a matrix to every node in a parse tree: the vector captures the inherent meaning of the constituent, while the matrix captures how it changes the meaning of neighboring words or phrases. This matrix-vector RNN can learn the meaning of operators in propositional logic and natural language. The model obtains state of the art performance on three different experiments: predicting fine-grained sentiment distributions of adverb-adjective pairs; classifying sentiment labels of movie reviews and classifying semantic relationships such as cause-effect or topic-message between nouns using the syntactic path between them."

                "text": "A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent' upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are representod by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only cerhain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case. is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. The amino acid sequences of a number of proteins have been compared to determine whether the relationships existing between them could have occurred by chance. Generally, these sequences are from proteins haring closely related functions and are so similar that simple visual comparisons can reveal sequence coincidence. Because the method of visual comparison is tedious and because the determination of the significance of a given result usually is left to intuitive rationalization, computer-based statistical approaches have been proposed (Fitch, 1966; Xeedleman 6 Blair, 1969). Direct comparison of two sequences, based on the presence in both of corresponding amino acids in a n identical array, is insuEcient to establish the full genetic relationships between the two proteins. Allowance for gaps (Braunitzer, 1965) greatly mnltiplies the number of comparisons t.hat can be made but int.roduces unnecessary and partial comparisons. The smallest unit of comparison is a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. The maximum match can be defined as the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of another protein while allowing for all possible deletions."

These days, WEKA enjoys widespread acceptance in both academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April 2000. This paper provides an introduction to the WEKA workbench, reviews the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable release, briefly discusses what has been added since the last stable version (Weka 3.4) released in 2003."
