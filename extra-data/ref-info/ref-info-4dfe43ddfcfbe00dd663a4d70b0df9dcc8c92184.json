But knowledge evolves over time; facts have associated validity intervals. Therefore, ontologies should include time as a first-class dimension. In this paper, we introduce Timely YAGO, which extends our previously built knowledge base YAGO with temporal aspects. This prototype system extracts temporal facts from Wikipedia infoboxes, categories, and lists in articles, and integrates these into the Timely YAGO knowledge base. We also support querying temporal facts, by temporal predicates in a SPARQL-style language. Visualization of query results is provided in order to better understand of the dynamic nature of knowledge."

YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques."

Machine learning systems, such as Kylin, use these infoboxes as training data, accurately extracting even more semantic knowledge from natural language text. But in order to realize the full power of this information, it must be situated in a cleanly-structured ontology. This paper introduces KOG, an autonomous system for refining Wikipedia's infobox-class ontology towards this end. We cast the problem of ontology refinement as a machine learning problem and solve it using both SVMs and a more powerful joint-inference approach expressed in Markov Logic Networks. We present experiments demonstrating the superiority of the joint-inference approach and evaluating other aspects of our system. Using these techniques, we build a rich ontology, integrating Wikipedia's infobox-class schemata with WordNet. We demonstrate how the resulting ontology may be used to enhance Wikipedia with improved query processing and other features."

We evaluate against a manual gold standard and show that both category disambiguation and taxonomy restructuring perform with high accuracy. Besides, we assess these methods on automatically generated datasets and show that we are able to effectively enrich WordNet with a large number of instances from Wikipedia. Our approach produces an integrated resource, thus bringing together the fine-grained classification of instances in Wikipedia and a well-structured top-level taxonomy from WordNet."

It explains how machine learning can be used to identify significant terms within unstructured text, and enrich it with links to the appropriate Wikipedia articles. The resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well, with recall and precision of almost 75%. This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or \"real world\" documents.\n This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text. Any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing, clustering, retrieval, and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics."

                "text": "Recent research has made significant advances in automatically constructing knowledge bases by extracting relational facts (e.g., Bill Clinton-presidentOf-US) from large text corpora. Temporally scoping such relational facts in the knowledge base (i.e., determining that Bill Clinton-presidentOf-US is true only during the period 1993 - 2001) is an important, but relatively unexplored problem. In this paper, we propose a joint inference framework for this task, which leverages fact-specific temporal constraints, and weak supervision in the form of a few labeled examples. Our proposed framework, CoTS (Coupled Temporal Scoping), exploits temporal containment, alignment, succession, and mutual exclusion constraints among facts from within and across relations. Our contribution is multi-fold. Firstly, while most previous research has focused on micro-reading approaches for temporal scoping, we pose it in a macro-reading fashion, as a change detection in a time series of facts' features computed from a large number of documents. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other work that has used joint inference for temporal scoping. We show that joint inference is effective compared to doing temporal scoping of individual facts independently. We conduct our experiments on large scale open-domain publicly available time-stamped datasets, such as English Gigaword Corpus and Google Books Ngrams, demonstrating CoTS's effectiveness."

This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs."

So far, however, the multilingual nature of Wikipedia has largely been neglected. This paper investigates how entities from all editions of Wikipedia as well as WordNet can be integrated into a single coherent taxonomic class hierarchy. We rely on linking heuristics to discover potential taxonomic relationships, graph partitioning to form consistent equivalence classes of entities, and a Markov chain-based ranking approach to construct the final taxonomy. This results in MENTA (Multilingual Entity Taxonomy), a resource that describes 5.4 million entities and is presumably the largest multilingual lexical knowledge base currently available."

Most IE work has focussed on identifying static facts, encoding them as binary relations. This is unfortunate, because the vast majority of facts are fluents, only holding true during an interval of time. It is less helpful to extract PresidentOf(Bill-Clinton, USA) without the temporal scope 1/20/93 - 1/20/01. This paper presents TIE, a novel, information-extraction system, which distills facts from text while inducing as much temporal information as possible. In addition to recognizing temporal relations between times and events, TIE performs global inference, enforcing transitivity to bound the start and ending times for each event. We introduce the notion of temporal entropy as a way to evaluate the performance of temporal IE systems and present experiments showing that TIE outperforms three alternative approaches."

It is eventually represented in a proprietary flat text file format and a core comprises 10 million facts and formulas. We present a translation of YAGO into the Bernays-Schonfinkel Horn class with equality. A new variant of the superposition calculus is sound, complete and terminating for this class. Together with extended term indexing data structures the new calculus is implemented in Spass-YAGO. YAGO can be finitely saturated by Spass-YAGO in about 1 hour. We have found 49 inconsistencies in the original generated ontology which we have fixed. Spass-YAGO can then prove non-trivial conjectures with respect to the resulting saturated and consistent clause set of about 1.4 GB in less than one second."

It was created in the context of the SemEval 2007 workshop and uses the TimeML annotation language. The evaluation consists of three subtasks of temporal annotation: anchoring an event to a time expression in the same sentence, anchoring an event to the document creation time, and ordering main events in consecutive sentences. In this paper we describe the TempEval task and the systems that participated in the evaluation. In addition, we describe how further task decomposition can bring even more structure to the evaluation of temporal relations."

The ongoing information explosion highlights the need to enable machines to better understand electronic text in natural human language. The challenge lies in how to transfer human knowledge to machines. Much work has been devoted to creating universal ontologies for this purpose. However, none of the existing ontologies has the necessary depth and breadth to offer \u201cuniversal understanding.\u201d In this paper, we present a universal, probabilistic ontology that is more comprehensive than any of the existing ontologies. It contains 2.7 million concepts harnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages and two years\u2019 worth of search log data. Unlike traditional knowledge bases that treat knowledge as black and white, it enables probabilistic interpretations of the information it contains. The probabilistic nature then enables it to incorporate heterogeneous information in a natural way. We present details of how the core ontology is constructed, and how it models knowledge\u2019s inherent uncertainty, ambiguity, and inconsistency. We also discuss potential applications, e.g., understanding user intent, that can benefit from the taxonomy."

However, the world is dynamic: periodic events like sports competitions need to be interpreted with their respective timepoints, and facts such as coaching a sports team, holding political or business positions, and even marriages do not hold forever and should be augmented by their respective timespans. This paper addresses the problem of automatically harvesting temporal facts with such extended time-awareness. We employ pattern-based gathering techniques for fact candidates and construct a weighted pattern-candidate graph. Our key contribution is a system called PRAVDA based on a new kind of label propagation algorithm with a judiciously designed loss function, which iteratively processes the graph to label good temporal facts for a given set of target relations. Our experiments with online news and Wikipedia articles demonstrate the accuracy of this method."

However, the majority of the work in this community has focused more on the thematic aspects of information and has paid less attention to its spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we present an integrative ontology-based framework incorporating the thematic, spatial, and temporal dimensions of information. This framework is built around the RDF metadata model. Our ultimate goal is to provide an information system which allows searching and analysis of relationships in any or all of the three dimensions of space, time, and theme. Toward this end, we present an upper-level ontology combining concepts and relationships from both the thematic and spatial dimensions and show how to incorporate temporal semantics into this ontology. We also introduce the notion of a thematic context linking entities of differing dimensions and define a set of query operators built upon these contexts."

Several systems have been proposed to link spots on Web pages to entities in Wikipedia. They are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity. Two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies, but in limited ways. We propose a general collective disambiguation approach. Our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains. We give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities. Optimizing the overall entity assignment is NP-hard. We investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing, rounding integer linear programs, and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters. In experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated Web pages and tens of thousands of spots, our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms."

While images of famous entities are abundant on the Internet, they are much harder to retrieve for less popular entities such as notable computer scientists or regionally interesting churches. Querying the entity names in image search engines yields large candidate lists, but they often have low precision and unsatisfactory recall. In this paper, we propose a principled model for finding images of rare or ambiguous named entities. We propose a set of efficient, light-weight algorithms for identifying entity-specific keyphrases from a given textual description of the entity, which we then use to score candidate images based on the matches of keyphrases in the underlying Web pages. Our experiments with a variety of entity categories show the high precision-recall quality of our approach."

                "text": "Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER\u2019s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract assertions."

SOFIE can parse natural language documents, extract ontological facts from them and link the facts into an ontology. SOFIE uses logical reasoning on the existing knowledge and on the new knowledge in order to disambiguate words to their most probable meaning, to reason on the meaning of text patterns and to take into account world knowledge axioms. This allows SOFIE to check the plausibility of hypotheses and to avoid inconsistencies with the ontology. The framework of SOFIE unites the paradigms of pattern matching, word sense disambiguation and ontological reasoning in one unified model. Our experiments show that SOFIE delivers high-quality output, even from unstructured Internet documents."

                "text": "The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities like Wikipedia and the advances in automated information extraction from Web pages enable the construction of large knowledge bases with facts about entities and their relationships. The facts can be represented in the RDF data model, as so-called subject-property-object triples, and can thus be queried by structured query languages like SPARQL. In principle, this allows precise querying in the database spirit. However, RDF data may be highly diverse and queries may return way too many results, so that ranking by informativeness measures is crucial to avoid overwhelming users. Moreover, as facts are extracted from textual contexts or have community-provided annotations, it can be beneficial to consider also keywords for formulating search requests. This paper gives an overview of recent and ongoing work on ranked retrieval of RDF data with keyword-augmented structured queries. The ranking method is based on statistical language models, the state-of-the-art paradigm in information retrieval. The paper develops a novel form of language models for the structured, but schema-less setting of RDF triples and extended SPARQL queries. 1 Motivation and Background Entity-Relationship graphs are receiving great attention for information management outside of mainstream database engines. In particular, the Semantic-Web data model RDF (Resource Description Format) is gaining popularity for applications on scientific data such as biological networks [14], social Web2.0 applications [4], large-scale knowledge bases such as DBpedia [2] or YAGO [13], and more generally, as a light-weight representation for the \u201cWeb of data\u201d [5]. An RDF data collection consists of a set of subject-property-object triples, SPO triples for short. In ER terminology, an SPO triple corresponds to a pair of entities connected by a named relationship or to an entity connected to the value of a named attribute. As the object of a triple can in turn be the subject of other triples, we can also view the RDF data as a graph of typed nodes and typed edges where nodes correspond to entities and edges to relationships (viewing attributes as relations as well). Some of the existing RDF collections contain more than a billion triples. As a simple example that we will use throughout the paper, consider a Web portal on movies. Table 1 shows a few sample triples. The example illustrates a number of specific requirements that RDF data poses for querying: Copyright 2010 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient representation model for time- dependent uncertainty in combination with first-order inference rules and recursive queries over RDF-like knowledge bases. In the spirit of data lineage, the intensional (i.e., rule-based) structure of query answers is reflected by Boolean formulas that capture the logical dependencies of each derived answer fact back to its extensional roots (i.e., base facts). Our approach incorporates simple weight aggregations for begin, end and during evidences for base facts, but also generalizes the common possible- worlds semantics known from probabilistic databases to histogram-like confidence distributions for derived facts. In particular, we show that adding time to the latter probabilistic setting adds only a light overhead in comparison to a time-unaware probabilistic setting."

This paper describes the key information extraction (IE) challenges that we have run into, and sketches our solutions. We discuss in particular developing a declarative IE language, optimizing for this language, generating IE provenance, incorporating user feedback into the IE process, developing a novel wiki-based user interface for feedback, best-effort IE, pushing IE into RDBMSs, and more. Our work suggests that IE in managing unstructured data can open up many interesting research challenges, and that these challenges can greatly benefit from the wealth of work on managing structured data that has been carried out by the database community."

Often, the analytical process requires uncovering and analyzing complex thematic relationships between disparate people, places and events. Fundamentally new query operators based on the graph structure of Semantic Web data models, such as semantic associations, are proving useful for this purpose. However, these analysis mechanisms are primarily intended for thematic relationships. In this paper, we describe a framework built around the RDF metadata model for analysis of thematic, spatial and temporal relationships between named entities. We discuss modeling issues and present a set of semantic query operators. We also describe an efficient implementation in Oracle DBMS and demonstrate the scalability of our approach with a performance study using a large synthetic dataset from the national security domain."

This representation of relational world knowledge is usually considerably better than completely unstructured, free-format text. At the same time, unlike manually-created knowledge bases, relational information mined from \"organic\" Web tables need not be constrained by availability of precious editorial time. Unfortunately, in the absence of any formal, uniform schema imposed on Web tables, Web search cannot take advantage of these high-quality sources of relational information. In this paper we propose new machine learning techniques to annotate table cells with entities that they likely mention, table columns with types from which entities are drawn for cells in the column, and relations that pairs of table columns seek to express. We propose a new graphical model for making all these labeling decisions for each table simultaneously, rather than make separate local decisions for entities, types and relations. Experiments using the YAGO catalog, DB-Pedia, tables from Wikipedia, and over 25 million HTML tables from a 500 million page Web crawl uniformly show the superiority of our approach. We also evaluate the impact of better annotations on a prototype relational Web search tool. We demonstrate clear benefits of our annotations beyond indexing tables in a purely textual manner."

We propose a methodology for the automatic construction of a large-scale multilingual lexical database where words of many languages are hierarchically organized in terms of their meanings and their semantic relations to other words. This resource is bootstrapped from WordNet, a well-known English-language resource. Our approach extends WordNet with around 1.5 million meaning links for 800,000 words in over 200 languages, drawing on evidence extracted from a variety of resources including existing (monolingual) wordnets, (mostly bilingual) translation dictionaries, and parallel corpora. Graph-based scoring functions and statistical learning techniques are used to iteratively integrate this information and build an output graph. Experiments show that this wordnet has a high level of precision and coverage, and that it can be useful in applied tasks such as cross-lingual text classification."

We particularly address the needs for building and maintaining business ontologies, where the time aspects of relations between companies, between companies and products, and between companies and customers are important. For example, the date on which a company acquired another company or when a new CEO took over is crucial information for business-intelligence applications. Our methods are geared for extracting business relations and their time information from three kinds of sources: Wikipedia infoboxes, Reuter\u2019s news feeds, and news pages provided by Google. All techniques are integrated into the TOB framework for timely business ontologies. Our experiments show that we can achieve fairly high precision for the extracted information."

Unlike many taxonomy learning approaches in the literature, our novel algorithm learns both concepts and relations entirely from scratch via the automated extraction of terms, definitions and hypernyms. This results in a very dense, cyclic and possibly disconnected hypernym graph. The algorithm then induces a taxonomy from the graph. Our experiments show that we obtain high-quality results, both when building brand-new taxonomies and when reconstructing WordNet sub-hierarchies."

Since ontologies are a centerpiece of most approaches , we believe that for an accurate evaluation of tools for quality, scalability and performance, the research community needs a freely available ontology with a large description base. If the use of tools is to be for advanced semantic applications, such as those in business intelligence and national security, then instances in the knowledge base should be highly interconnected. Thus, we propose and describe a Semantic W Eb Technology evaluation Ontology (SWETO) test-bed. In particular, we address the requirements of a test-bed to support research in semantic analytics, as well as the steps in its development, including, ontology creation, semi-automatic data extraction, and entity disambiguation."

For example, when RDF triples are extracted automatically by information extraction programs, there is a need to represent where the triples came from, what their temporal validity is, and how certain we are that the triple is correct. Today, there is no theoretically clean and practically scalable mechanism that spans these different needs - reification is the only solution propose to date, and its implementations have been ugly. In this paper, we present Annotated RDF (or aRDF for short) in which RDF triples are annotated by members of a partially ordered set (with bottom element) that can be selected in any way desired by the user. We present a formal declarative semantics (model theory) for annotated RDF and develop algorithms to check consistency of aRDF theories and to answer queries to aRDF theories. We show that annotated RDF supports users who need to think about the uncertainty, temporal aspects, and provenance of the RDF triples in an RDF database. We develop a prototype aRDF implementation and show that our algorithms work efficiently even on real world data sets containing over 10 million triples."

Stateof-the-art approaches combine pattern-based gathering of fact candidates with constraint-based reasoning. However, they still face major challenges regarding the trade-offs between precision, recall, and scalability. Techniques that scale well are susceptible to noisy patterns that degrade precision, while techniques that employ deep reasoning for high precision cannot cope with Web-scale data.\n This paper presents a scalable system, called PROSPERA, for high-quality knowledge harvesting. We propose a new notion of ngram-itemsets for richer patterns, and use MaxSat-based constraint reasoning on both the quality of patterns and the validity of fact candidates.We compute pattern-occurrence statistics for two benefits: they serve to prune the hypotheses space and to derive informative weights of clauses for the reasoner. The paper shows how to incorporate these building blocks into a scalable architecture that can parallelize all phases on a Hadoop-based distributed platform. Our experiments with the ClueWeb09 corpus include comparisons to the recent ReadTheWeb experiment. We substantially outperform these prior results in terms of recall, with the same precision, while having low run-times."

Bootstrapping systems significantly reduce the number of training examples, but they usually apply heuristic-based methods to combine a set of strict hard rules, which limit the ability to generalize and thus generate a low recall. Furthermore, existing bootstrapping methods do not perform open information extraction (Open IE), which can identify various types of relations without requiring pre-specifications. In this paper, we propose a statistical extraction framework called Statistical Snowball (StatSnowball), which is a bootstrapping system and can perform both traditional relation extraction and Open IE.\n StatSnowball uses the discriminative Markov logic networks (MLNs) and softens hard rules by learning their weights in a maximum likelihood estimate sense. MLN is a general model, and can be configured to perform different levels of relation extraction. In StatSnwoball, pattern selection is performed by solving an l1-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation, which enjoys well-founded theories and efficient solvers. We extensively evaluate the performance of StatSnowball in different configurations on both a small but fully labeled data set and large-scale Web data. Empirical results show that StatSnowball can achieve a significantly higher recall without sacrificing the high precision during iterations with a small number of seeds, and the joint inference of MLN can improve the performance. Finally, StatSnowball is efficient and we have developed a working entity relation search engine called Renlifang based on it."

Each nugget is a document sentence fragment that encodes open-domain factual information associated to some entity. The entities are dates (e.g., 1971) when the events captured by the nuggets must have occurred. The nuggets are extracted from the unstructured text of Web documents, based on lightweight text processing. Since per-document time stamps are available only in restricted collections such as news articles, but not in arbitrary Web documents, the extraction of the relevant dates relies on simple, local text analysis. The resulting time-stamped text nuggets have immediate applications in Web search, as direct results for queries asking about the date of an event explicitly (e.g., \"When was the transistor invented\") or implicitly (e.g., \"Golden Gate Bridge built\")."

However, it is frequently the case that even for a fixed subject and property, the value varies with time. As a consequence, efforts have been made to annotate RDF triples with \"valid time\" intervals. However, to date, no proposals exist for efficient indexing of such temporal RDF databases. It is clearly beneficial to store RDF data in a relational DB - however, standard relational indexes are inadequately equipped to handle RDF's graph structure. In this paper, we propose the tGRIN index structure that builds a specialized index for temporal RDF that is physically stored in an RDBMS. Past efforts to store RDF in relational stores include Jena2 from HP, Sesame from OpenRDF.org, and 3store from the University of Southampton. We show that even when these efforts are augmented with well known temporal indexes like R+ trees, SR-trees, ST-index, and MAP21, the tGRIN index exhibits superior performance. In terms of index build time, tGRIN takes two thirds or less of the time used by any other system, and it uses a comparable amount of memory and less disk space than Jena, Sesame and 3store. More importantly, tGRIN can answer queries three to six times faster for average query graph patterns and five to ten times faster for complex queries than these systems."

In particular, we propose an approach and a set of design principles for such an agent, describe a partial implementation of such a system that has already learned to extract a knowledge base containing over 242,000 beliefs with an estimated precision of 74% after running for 67 days, and discuss lessons learned from this preliminary attempt to build a never-ending learning agent."

Header rows exist in few cases and even when they do, the attribute names are typically useless. We describe a system that attempts to recover the semantics of tables by enriching the table with additional annotations. Our annotations facilitate operations such as searching for tables and finding related tables. \n \nTo recover semantics of tables, we leverage a database of class labels and relationships automatically extracted from the Web. The database of classes and relationships has very wide coverage, but is also noisy. We attach a class label to a column if a sufficient number of the values in the column are identified with that label in the database of class labels, and analogously for binary relationships. We describe a formal model for reasoning about when we have seen sufficient evidence for a label, and show that it performs substantially better than a simple majority scheme. We describe a set of experiments that illustrate the utility of the recovered semantics for table search and show that it performs substantially better than previous approaches. In addition, we characterize what fraction of tables on the Web can be annotated using our approach."

One problematic area for access to digital library resources has been the search for time periods or events. If there is a capability to search for time, it is usually a date search - a standardized and precise form but unfortunately rarely used in common chronological expressions. For example, a user interested in the \"Vietnam war\", \"Clinton administration\" or the \"Elizabethan period\" must either know the corresponding dates, or rely on simple keyword matching for those period names. We consider the ability to interpret user statements of periods or eras as ranges of dates and to associate them with particular locations an important feature of an information system. This paper describes the time period directory, a metadata infrastructure for named time periods linking them with their geographic location as well as a canonical time period range"

This paper presents a framework to incorporate temporal reasoning into RDF, yielding temporal RDF graphs. We present a semantics for these kinds of graphs which includes the notion of temporal entailment and a syntax to incorporate this framework into standard RDF graphs, using the RDF vocabulary plus temporal labels. We give a characterization of temporal entailment in terms of RDF entailment and show that the former does not yield extra asymptotic complexity with respect to nontemporal RDF graphs. We also discuss temporal RDF graphs with anonymous timestamps, providing a theoretical framework for the study of temporal anonymity. Finally, we sketch a temporal query language for RDF, along with complexity results for query evaluation that show that the time dimension preserves the tractability of answers"

This problem is compounded by representation languages such as OWL that are biased towards binary relations; even when the relationships that vary with time are binary, the time the relationship holds typically requires a third argument. We discuss the standard approach to this problem, and contrast it to a new alternative based on a four-dimensionalist (perdurantist) ontology, which allows us to use more of the expressive power of description logics. The technique is usable in other logics as well."

A query system based on this database would offer the same breadth as a Web search engine, but with much more sophisticated query tools than are common today. Unfortunately, these domain-independent Web extractors are usually not modelindependent; e.g., an extractor that only finds binary relations from text will be blind to relational data found in tables. Because a topic area often has a data model that is a natural fit (e.g., population statistics are usually in tables, while biographical facts about Einstein are embedded in text), even a high-quality domain-independent extractor will miss a substantial amount of data. Our omnivore system attempts to build a comprehensive Web database by running multiple domain-independent extractors in parallel over a Web crawl, then combining their outputs into a single large entity-relationship database. Each item in the database describes a single real-world entity, and can contain information drawn from a number of popular Web data models. The user can correct flaws in the database, and can query it using either a structured query language or a search-like interface. Due to the Web\u2019s sheer size, users cannot be expected to know the result set\u2019s metadata a priori, so omnivore automatically chooses an output model and schema when it renders results. In this paper we outline the omnivore architecture and provide specific details about our current prototype."

                "text": "The World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstructured documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. We extracted 14.1 billion HTML tables from Google's general-purpose web crawl, and used statistical classification techniques to find the estimated 154M that contain high-quality relational data. Because each relational table has its own \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, each such table can be considered a small structured database. The resulting corpus of databases is larger than any other corpus we are aware of, by at least five orders of magnitude. \n \nWe describe the WEBTABLES system to explore two fundamental questions about this collection of databases. First, what are effective techniques for searching for structured data at search-engine scales? Second, what additional power can be derived by analyzing such a huge corpus? \n \nFirst, we develop new techniques for keyword search over a corpus of tables, and show that they can achieve substantially higher relevance than solutions based on a traditional search engine. Second, we introduce a new object derived from the database corpus: the attribute correlation statistics database (AcsDB) that records corpus-wide statistics on co-occurrences of schema elements. In addition to improving search relevance, the AcsDB makes possible several novel applications: schema auto-complete, which helps a database designer to choose schema elements; attribute synonym finding, which automatically computes attribute synonym pairs for schema matching; and join-graph traversal, which allows a user to navigate between extracted schemas using automatically-generated join links."

Since then, 100+ skyline-related papers have been published; however, we discovered that one of the most intuitive and practical type of skyline queries, namely, group-by skyline queries remains unaddressed. Group-by skyline queries find the skyline for each group of tuples. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on processing group-by skyline queries in the context of relational engines. Specifically, we examine the composition of a query plan for a group-by skyline query and develop the missing cost model for the BBS algorithm. Experimental results show that our techniques are able to devise the best query plans for a variety of group-by skyline queries. Our focus is on algorithms that can be directly implemented in today's commercial database systems without the addition of new access methods (which would require addressing the associated challenges of maintenance with updates, concurrency control, etc.)."

One system that does set expansion is SEAL (set expander for any language), which expands entities automatically by utilizing resources from the Web in a language independent fashion. In a previous study, SEAL showed good set expansion performance using three seed entities; however, when given a larger set of seeds (e.g., ten), SEAL's expansion method performs poorly. In this paper, we present iterative SEAL (iSEAL), which allows a user to provide many seeds. Briefly, iSEAL makes several calls to SEAL, each call using a small number of seeds. We also show that iSEAL can be used in a \"bootstrapping\" manner, where each call to SEAL uses a mixture of user-provided and self-generated seeds. We show that the bootstrapping version of iSEAL obtains better results than SEAL even when using fewer user-provided seeds. In addition, we compare the performance of various ranking algorithms used in iSEAL, and show that the choice of ranking method has a small effect on performance when all seeds are user-provided, but a large effect when iSEAL is bootstrapped. In particular, we show that random walk with restart is nearly as good as Bayesian sets with user-provided seeds, and performs best with bootstrapped seeds."

This enables RDF statements that describe graphs, which is beneficial in many Semantic Web application areas. As a case study, we explore the application area of Semantic Web publishing: Named Graphs allow publishers to communicate assertional intent, and to sign their graphs; information consumers can evaluate specific graphs using task-specific trust policies, and act on information from those Named Graphs that they accept. Graphs are trusted depending on: their content; information about the graph; and the task the user is performing. The extension of RDF to Named Graphs provides a formally defined framework to be a foundation for the Semantic Web trust layer."

The \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d nature of RDF and the flexible pattern-matching capabilities of its query language SPARQL entail efficiency and scalability challenges for complex queries including long join paths. This paper presents the RDF-3X engine, an implementation of SPARQL that achieves excellent performance by pursuing a RISC-style architecture with streamlined indexing and query processing. The physical design is identical for all RDF-3X databases regardless of their workloads, and completely eliminates the need for index tuning by exhaustive indexes for all permutations of subject-property-object triples and their binary and unary projections. These indexes are highly compressed, and the query processor can aggressively leverage fast merge joins with excellent performance of processor caches. The query optimizer is able to choose optimal join orders even for complex queries, with a cost model that includes statistical synopses for entire join paths. Although RDF-3X is optimized for queries, it also provides good support for efficient online updates by means of a staging architecture: direct updates to the main database indexes are deferred, and instead applied to compact differential indexes which are later merged into the main indexes in a batched manner. Experimental studies with several large-scale datasets with more than 50 million RDF triples and benchmark queries that include pattern matching, manyway star-joins, and long path-joins demonstrate that RDF-3X can outperform the previously best alternatives by one or two orders of magnitude."

The GiST allows new data types to be indexed in a manner supporting queries natural to the types; this is in contrast to previous work on tree extensibility which only supported the traditional set of equality and range predicates. In a single data structure, the GiST provides all the basic search tree logic required by a database system, thereby unifying disparate structures such as B+-trees and R-trees in a single piece of code, and opening the application of search trees to general extensibility. To illustrate the flexibility of the GiST, we provide simple method implementations that allow it to behave like a B+-tree, an R-tree, and an RD-tree, a new index for data with set-valued attributes. We also present a preliminary performance analysis of RD-trees, which leads to discussion on the nature of tree indices and how they behave for various datasets."

                "text": "On behalf of the organizing committee, we wholeheartedly welcome you to the ACM Eighteenth International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2009). We hope this conference proves to be interesting and beneficial. \n \nCIKM 2009 was originally planned to be held in Beijing, China. However, due to unforeseen reasons, CIKM 2009 had to be moved to Hong Kong in early December 2009, and the organizing committee was re-invited. This late re-organization of the conference caused many troubles and much burden in terms of preparation and financial costs. Despite the shortened time period and financial problems, David Cheung, the newly invited General co-Chair, and his local team worked very diligently to carefully prepare an outstanding program for everyone. \n \nSince its inception, the CIKM conference has provided a unique international forum for the presentation, discussion, and dissemination of research findings in data management, information retrieval, and knowledge management. The conference has been a leading forum in which experts from academia, industry, and the government gather to exchange ideas, research achievements, and technical developments in multidisciplinary research areas. \n \nCIKM has rapidly grown to become one of the world's most recognized conferences in the field. CIKM 2009 has received a record high number of submissions in the history of CIKM, as can be seen from the following statistics: - 1153 abstracts submitted - 847 full papers submitted - 123 papers accepted for presentation as full papers (14.5% acceptance rate) and an additional 171 were accepted for poster presentation. \n \nIn addition to regular research tracks, CIKM 2009 features 3 keynote speakers, 4 pre-conference tutorials, 11 workshops, 18 industrial papers, 24 demo papers, and 1 panel. We are proud of our program and acknowledge the tireless efforts of people who materialized this program. \n \nFirst of all, we are honored to have 3 distinguished keynote speakers: Kyu-Young Whang, Edward Chang, and Clement Yu. We deeply appreciate their time and commitment to attend our conference and share their cutting-edge research experiences and insightful comments in their research topics."

The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA."

The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the stan- d ardWaldconfid ence interval has previously been remarkedon in the literature (Blyth andStill, Agresti andCoull, Santner andothers). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Waldinter- val are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects andcannot be trusted . This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and con- text. Each interval is examinedfor its coverage probability andits length. Basedon this analysis, we recommendthe Wilson interval or the equal- tailedJeffreys prior interval for small n andthe interval suggestedin Agresti andCoull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval."

It is a fact that these coefficients occasionally yield unexpected results in situations known as the paradoxes of kappa. This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized pi and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics."

We study the design of algorithms and data structures that can exploit the flash memory devices better. For this, we characterize the performance of NAND flash based storage devices, including many solid state disks. We show that these devices have better random read performance than hard disks, but much worse random write performance. We also analyze the effect of misalignments, aging and past I/O patterns etc. on the performance obtained on these devices. We show that despite the similarities between flash memory and RAM (fast random reads) and between flash disk and hard disk (both are block based devices), the algorithms designed in the RAM model or the external memory model do not realize the full potential of the flash memory devices. We later give some broad guidelines for designing algorithms which can exploit the comparative advantages of both a flash memory device and a hard disk, when used together."
