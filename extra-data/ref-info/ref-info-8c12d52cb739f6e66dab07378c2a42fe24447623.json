The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

                "text": "This thesis develops a mathematical basis for understanding the structure of on-line handwritten documents and explores some of the related problems in detail. With the increase in popularity of portable computing devices, such as PDAs and handheld computers, non-keyboard based methods for data entry are receiving more attention in the research communities and commercial sector. The most promising options are pen-based and speech-based inputs. Pen-based input devices generate handwritten documents which have on-line or dynamic (temporal) information encoded in them. Digitizing devices like Smart-Boards and computing platforms, which use pen-based input such as the IBM Thinkpad TransNote and Tablet PCs, create on-line documents. As these devices become available and affordable, large volumes of digital handwritten data will be generated and the problem of archiving and retrieving such data becomes an important concern. This thesis addresses the problem of on-line document understanding, which is an essential component of an effective retrieval algorithm. \nThis thesis describes a mathematical model for representation of on-line handwritten data based on the mechanics of the writing process. The representation is used for extracting various properties of the handwritten data, which forms the basis for understanding the higher level structure of a document. A principled approach to the problem of document segmentation is presented using a parsing technique based on stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). The parser generates a segmentation of the handwritten page, which is optimal with respect to a proposed compactness criterion. Additional properties of a region are identified based on the nature and layout of handwritten strokes in the region. An algorithm to identify ruled and unruled tables is presented. The thesis also proposes a set of features for identification of scripts within the text regions and develops an algorithm for script classification. \nThe thesis presents a matching algorithm, which computes a similarity measure between the query and handwriting samples in a database. The query and database samples could be either words or sketches, which are automatically identified by the document segmentation algorithm. We also address the related problem of document security, where on-line handwritten signatures are used to watermark on-line and off-line documents. The use of a biometric trait, such as signature, for watermarking allows the recipient of a document to verify the identity of the author in addition to document integrity."

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective table detection method via visual separators and geometric content layout information, targeting at PDF documents. The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore, we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale Chinese e-Book production."

In this paper we report a very simple but extremely powerful approach to detect tables present in document pages. The algorithm relies on the observation that the tables have distinct columns which implies that gaps between the fields are substantially larger than the gaps between the words in text lines. This deceptively simple observation has led to the design of a simple but powerful table detection system with low computation cost. Moreover, mathematical foundation of the approach is also established including formation of a regular expression for ease of implementation."

First, we separate text components (machine-print, handwriting) from the rest of the page using an SVM classifier. We then employ a correlation-based approach to measure the coherence between adjacent text lines which may be part of the same table, solving the resulting page decomposition problem using dynamic programming.

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The algorithm for table detection is based on identifying the unique table start pattern and table trailer pattern. We have formulated perceptual attributes to characterize the patterns. The performance of our table detection system is tested on a set of document images picked from UW-III (University of Washington) dataset, UNLV dataset, video images of NPTEL videos, and our own dataset. Our approach demonstrates improved detection for different types of table layouts, with or without ruling lines. We have obtained correct table localization on pages with multiple tables aligned side-by-side."

This paper proposes a novel digital image binarization scheme for low quality historical documents allowing further content exploitation in an efficient way. The proposed scheme consists of five distinct steps: a pre-processing procedure using a low-pass Wiener filter, a rough estimation of foreground regions using Niblack\u2019s approach, a background surface calculation by interpolating neighboring background intensities, a thresholding by combining the calculated background surface with the original image and finally a post-processing step in order to improve the quality of text regions and preserve stroke connectivity. The proposed methodology works with great success even in cases of historical manuscripts with poor quality, shadows, nonuniform illumination, low contrast, large signal- dependent noise, smear and strain. After testing the proposed method on numerous low quality historical manuscripts, it has turned out that our methodology performs better compared to current state-of-the-art adaptive thresholding techniques."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables, and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies the decisions that are made by a table recognizer, and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

In this paper we experiment with different ways of combining the components of an HMM for document analysis applications, in particular for finding tables in text. We show: a) how to integrate different document structure finders into the HMM; b) that transition probabilities should vary along the chain to embed general knowledge axioms of our field, c) some emission energies can be selectively ignored, and d) emission and transition probabilities can be weighed differently. We conclude these changes increase the expressiveness and usability of HMMs in our field."
