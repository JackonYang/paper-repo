It is tempting to apportion determination among the factors by using the terms Pi A,L of equation (6) as measures of determination, and this has been done by some authors, e.g. Kirchevsky (1927) who independently reached a somewhat similar viewpoint on the interpretation of systems of correlated variables in other respects."
