Automatic generation of object recognition programs requires several key components to be developed: object models to describe the geometric and photometric properties of an object to be recognized, sensor models to predict object appearances from the object model under a given sensor, strategy generation using the pred,icted appearances to produce an recognition strategy, and program generation converting the recognition strategy into an executable code. This paper concentrates on sensor modeling and its relationship with strategy generation, because we regard it as the bottle neck to automatic generation of object recognition programs. We consider two aspects of sensor characteristics: sensor detectability and sensor reliability. Sensor detectability specifies what kinds of features can be detected and in what condition the features are detected; sensor reliability is a confidence for the detected features. We define the configuration space to represent sensor characteristics. We propose a representation method for sensor detectability and rcliability in the configuration space. Finally, we investigate how to use the proposed sensor modcl in automatic generation of an objcct recognition program."

In contrast to the traditional approach, we formulate the recognition problem as one of matching visual appearance than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illummation conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties of an object and are constant, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. We present a new compact representation of object appearance that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of Images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This large image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a hypersurface. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image onto the eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the hypersurface it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the hypersurface determines the object's pose in the image. We have conducted experiments usmg several objects with complex appearance characteristics. These results suggest the proposed appearance representation to be a valuable tool for a variety of machine vision applications."

The object recognition problem is addressed as the problem of best describing a match between a hypothesized object and an image. The normalized correlation coefficient is used as a measure of the match. Templates are generated on-line during the search by transforming model images. Simulated annealing reduces the search time by orders of magnitude with respect to an exhaustive search. The algorithm is applied to the problem of how landmarks, e.g., traffic signs, can be recognized by a navigating robot. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm with real-world images of complicated scenes with traffic signs. False positive matches occur only for templates with very small information content. To avoid false positive matches, we propose a method to select model images for robust object recognition by measuring the information content of the model images. The algorithm works well in noisy images for model images with high information content.<<ETX>>"

While some systems, especially template-based ones, have been quite successful on expressionless, frontal views of faces with controlled lighting, not much work has taken face recognizers beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal is to build a face recognizer that works under varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle face relations in depth. Building on successful template-based systems, our basic approach is to represent faces with templates from multiple model views that cover different poses from the viewing sphere. To recognize a novel view, the recognizer locates the eyes and nose features, uses these locations to geometrically register the input with model views, and then uses correlation on model templates to find the best match in the data base of people. Our system has achieved a recognition rate of 98% on a data base of 62 people containing 10 testing and 15 modeling views per person.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations. Three alternative methods of determining the transformation that matches a model to a given image are proposed. >"

In this paper, we introduce a vectorized image representation, which is a feature-based representation where correspondence has been established with respect to a reference image. This representation has two components: (1) shape, or (x, y) feature locations, and (2) texture, defined as the image grey levels mapped onto the standard reference image. This paper explores an automatic technique for ``vectorizing'''' face images. Our face vectorizer alternates back and forth between computation steps for shape and texture, and a key idea is to structure the two computations so that each one uses the output of the other. A hierarchical coarse-to-fine implementation is discussed, and applications are presented to the problems of facial feature detection and registration of two arbitrary faces."

Objects are represented in terms of canonic 2D models which can be used to determine the identity, location and orientation of an unknown object. The reduction in dimensionality is achieved by factoring the space of all possible perspective projections of an object into a set of characteristic views, where each such view defines a characteristic-view domain within which all projections are topologically identical and related by a linear transformation. The characteristic views of an object can then be hierarchically structured for efficient classification. The line-junction labelling constraints are used to match a characteristic view to a given unknown-object projection, and determination of the unknown-object projection-to-characteristic view transformation then provides information about the identity as well as the location and orientation of the object."

We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

Two types of density estimates are derived for modeling the training data: a multivariate Gaussian (for a unimodal distributions) and a multivariate Mixture-of-Gaussians model (for multimodal distributions). These probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition. This learning technique is tested in experiments with modeling and subsequent detection of human faces and non-rigid objects such as hands.<<ETX>>"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

But what if we only have one real view available, such as a scanned passport photo-can we still recognize faces under different poses? Given one real view at a known pose, it is still possible to use the view-based approach by exploiting prior knowledge of faces to generate virtual views, or views of the face as seen from different poses. To represent prior knowledge, we use 2D example views of prototype faces under different rotations. We develop example-based techniques for applying the rotation seen in the prototypes to essentially \"rotate\" the single real view which is available. Next, the combined set of one real and multiple virtual views is used as example views for a view-based, pose-invariant face recognizer. Oar experiments suggest that among the techniques for expressing prior knowledge of faces, 2D example-based approaches should be considered alongside the more standard 3D modeling techniques.<<ETX>>"

The single-output neuron is trained to be either a 0 or a 1. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, 1/2. The set of inputs that produce an output of 1/2 forms the classification boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the sharpness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pair locations are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and are presented to the oracle for proper classification. These new data are used to further refine the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power security assessment is given"

These descriptors can be constructed using the methods of invariant theory, which are briefly surveyed. A range of applications of invariant descriptors in 3D model-based vision is demonstrated. First, a model-based vision system that recognizes curved plane objects irrespective of their pose is demonstrated. Curves are not reduced to polyhedral approximations but are handled as objects in their own right. Models are generated directly from image data. Once objects have been recognized, their pose can be computed. Invariant descriptors for 3D objects with plane faces are described. All these ideas are demonstrated using images of real scenes. The stability of a range of invariant descriptors to measurement error is treated in detail. >"

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

It concentrates on the task of learning whether three clumps of points in a 256x256 image form an equilateral triangle. We argue that feed-forward networks for solving this task would not scale well to images of this size. One reason for this is that local information does not contribute to the solution: it is necessary to compute relational information such as the distances between points. Our solution implements a mechanism for dynamically extracting the locations of the point clusters. It consists of an efficient focus of attention mechanism and a cluster detection scheme. The focus of attention mechanism allows the system to select any circular portion of the image in constant time. The cluster detector directs the focus of attention to clusters in the image. These two mechanisms are used to sequentially extract the relevant coordinates. With this new representation (locations of the points) very few training examples are required to learn the correct function. The resulting network is also very compact: the number of required weights is proportional to the number of input pixels."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of non-overlapping parts previously described in [Grimson & Lozano--P\u00e9rez 84] and [Gaston & Lozano-P\u00e9rez 84]."

This study, however, demonstrates that these networks, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and k nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers, all provide similar low error rates on a large handwritten digit database. The backpropagation network is overall superior in memory usage and classification time but can provide false positive classifications when the input is not a digit. The backpropagation network also has the longest training time. The RBF classifier requires more memory and more classification time, but less training time. When high accuracy is warranted, the RBF classifier can generate a more effective confidence judgment for rejecting ambiguous inputs. The simple kNN classifier can also perform handwritten digit recognition, but requires a prohibitively large amount of memory and is much slower at classification. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the algorithm and fast training characteristics makes the kNN classifier an attractive candidate in hardware-assisted classification tasks. These results on a large, high input dimensional problem demonstrate that practical constraints including training time, memory usage, and classification time often constrain classifier selection more strongly than small differences in overall error rate."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of non-overlapping parts previously developed by the authors."

A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition.

The first phase determines the set of surfaces involved in the parcellation of viewing space around the object. Three types of surfaces are involved: object planes, in which the faces of the object lie, auxiliary planes, defined by the visual interaction of edge-vertex pairs, and auxiliary quadric surfaces, defined by the visual interaction of edge triplets. Auxiliary planes and surfaces in a sense enumerate the potential self-occlusions of the object. A list is constructed for each type of surface. Next the algorithm constructs the geometric incidence lattice representing the arrangement of object planes, and distinguishes each 3-face (node) as representing either object or viewing space. The auxiliary planes and surfaces are then added to the lattice. Each 3-face (node) in the lattice has visibility attributes which identify the potentially visible object features from viewpoints within it. These attributes are updated throughout the process of building the lattice. Finally, the lattice is traversed to make a final update of the visibility attributes and merge neighboring 3-faces which have the same visible features. The resulting structure represents the perspective projection aspect graph."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

Generalization results are reported as a function of training set size and network capacity. Given a large training set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For those developing hand-printed character recognition systems, these results suggest that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. Benefits of reducing the number of net connections, other than improving generalization, are discussed."

Curves corresponding to various visual events partition the Gaussian sphere into regions where the image structure is stable. A catalogue of these events for piecewise-smooth objects is available from singularity theory. For a solid bounded by rational parametric patches and their intersection curves, it is shown that each visual event is characterized by a system of n polynomials in n + 1 variables whose solutions can be found by numerical curve tracing methods. Combining these methods with ray tracing, it is possible to characterize the stable image structure within each region. Results from a preliminary implementation are presented."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The question of generalization of network performance from a finite training set to unseen data is clearly of crucial importance. In this article we first show that the generalization error can be decomposed into two terms: the approximation error, due to the insufficient representational capacity of a finite sized network, and the estimation error, due to insufficient information about the target function because of the finite number of samples. We then consider the problem of learning functions belonging to certain Sobolev spaces with gaussian radial basis functions. Using the above-mentioned decomposition we bound the generalization error in terms of the number of basis functions and number of examples. While the bound that we derive is specific for radial basis functions, a number of observations deriving from it apply to any approximation technique. Our result also sheds light on ways to choose an appropriate network architecture for a particular problem and the kinds of problems that can be effectively solved with finite resources, i.e., with a finite number of parameters and finite amounts of data."

This framework quantitatively embodies 'Occam's razor'. Over-complex and under-regularised models are automatically inferred to be less probable, even though their flexibility allows them to fit the data better. \nWhen applied to 'neural networks', the Bayesian framework makes possible (1) objective comparison of solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of type of weight decay terms (or regularisers); (4) on-line techniques for optimising weight decay (or regularisation constant) magnitude; (5) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (6) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output. In the case of classification models, it is shown that the careful incorporation of error bar information into a classifier's predictions yields improved performance. \nComparisons of the inferences of the Bayesian framework with more traditional cross-validation methods help detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. \nThe relationship of the Bayesian learning framework to 'active learning' is examined. Objective functions are discussed which measure the expected informativeness of candidate data measurements, in the context of both interpolation and classification problems. \nThe concepts and methods described in this thesis are quite general and will be applicable to other data modelling problems whether they involve regression, classification or density estimation."

This is particularly true in areas where the problems do not lend themselves to systematic programming, such as pattern recognition in natural environments. The feasibility of learning an unknown function from examples depends on two questions: 1. Do the examples convey enough information to determine the function? 2. Is there a speedy way of constructing the function from the examples? These questions contrast the roles of information and complexity in learning. While the two roles share some ground, they are conceptually and technically different. In the common language of learning, the information question is that of generalization and the complexity question is that of scaling. The work of Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) provides the key tools for dealing with the information issue. In this review, we develop the main ideas of this framework and discuss how complexity fits in."

We introduce a method that generalizes learning from examples to learning from hints. A canonical representation of hints is defined and illustrated for new types of hints. All the hints are represented to the learning process by examples, and examples of the function are treated on equal footing with the rest of the hints. During learning, examples from different hints are selected for processing according to a given schedule. We present two types of schedules; fixed schedules that specify the relative emphasis of each hint, and adaptive schedules that are based on how well each hint has been learned so far. Our learning method is compatible with any descent technique that we may choose to use."

                "text": "ion planning It may be possible to take a coarser view of the problem space, as though we could back off and see the general features while omitting the details. This is one form of planning (a different form than embodied in Heuristic DENDRAL, to be described shortly). We will call it abstraction to keep the terminology clear. In the terms of our paradigm of problem solving, abstraction can be achieved by defining a new set of problem-state descriptions, based on a language that is an abstrac34 APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTRY tion of the basic language in the sense that one problem-state description in the abstraction language corresponds to many problem-state descriptions in the basic language. The new view of the problem space now offers a diminished set of states and therefore reduces the complexity of the problem. Transformations for the abstraction language defme the connectivity of the abstracted space. If the problem solver can discover a path from initial state to goal state in the abstracted space, he has not solved the original problem but has established a plan. Each step of the plan then becomes a problem in the original space, but the combined complexity of all these problems may be less than the complexity of the original problem. Working backward For some problems the number of alternatives to be searched is fewer if we begin at the goal state and, running the transformations in reverse as it were, search for the initial state. This situation might be the case if there is only one goal state but a multitude of initial states. Working backward is a time-honored procedure in mathematics and logic. Of course it is of no use for problems in which the transformations are not reversible, or when the definition of goal state is in terms to which the transformations cannot apply, as with chess. One would be hard put to play chess by working backward from a definition of checkmate, looking for the initial board configuration. 3.2.2.2 Heuristic generation Generate and test If there is a procedure that can generate candidate solution, goal states in our present terminology, it may be possible to solve problems by the sequential enumeration and checking of potential solutions. This method is frequently called generate and test. Note that in this paradigm it is not the states of the problem space that are generated. Indeed there need not be a problem space of the sort we have been discussing. Here we need only a space of solutions that can be generated for consideration. This paradigm is thus fundamentally different from searching the space of problem states (state-space search). Analogs of the heuristic search methods described above apply to heuristic generation. Statistical information concerning the distribution of solutions (perhaps by categories defined in a \u201csecondary solution description language\u201d) may be used to guide generation, If some measure of goodness is computable from a proposed solution, then a hill-climbing procedure could be used to determine ways of modifying one proposal in appropriate ways. Similarly, if an abstracted description of, the set of solutions can be constructed, it may be possible to search first for the\u2019correct solution class, and then search within that class. These methods do not exhaust the possibilities, but they provide enough structure for our discussion. 3.2.3 Multiple Sources of Knowledge Much more problem-solving power can be achieved if there is more than one source of information that can be used. For this reason purely syntactic problem solvers are inherently less powerful than those that employ semantic information as well. The secret ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 35 is not that semantic information is more important, but that two sources of guidance are better than one. Jigsaw puzzles are an appropriate image to make this procedure clear. The problem of finding the one arrangement of all the pieces that yields the desired picture may be a very difficult and large combinatorial task. If the puzzle were done with the pieces face down, analogous to having only the \u201csyntactic\u201d information of piece contours, the true difficulty of the problem would become apparent. If all the pieces were of the same shape, squares or hexagons, the problem could only be solved from the \u201csemantic\u201d information of colors and pictured objects and would also be very difficult. Jigsaw puzzles are tractable because both these sources of information are available and can be played off against one another. In terms of the paradigm of state-space search, different sources of information correspond to different problem-state languages. Several of the search heuristics defmed above rely on these secondary languages. Hill climbing needs a language in which to define its gradient of \u201cwarmth,\u201d and statistically guided search is based on a rather general but blurry-visioned search for descriptors that have some correlational information. Abstraction planning is another way of bringing to bear different views of the problem space. On a more general level, apart from any of these methods, is the representation problem. A problem has in general many possible representations. It may be possible to choose two or more (rather than just one) in such a way that progress in one statespace search can be transferred to another. Thus those transitions that are difficult in one representation may be bypassed by using a second and vice versa. In the context of heuristic generation, multiple sources of knowledge have the effect of limiting generation to the intersection of the solution sets delimited by each source."

We consider training such networks in a completely supervised manner, but abandon this approach in favor of a more computationally efficient hybrid learning method which combines self-organized and supervised learning. Our networks learn faster than backpropagation for two reasons: the local representations ensure that only a few units respond to any given input, thus reducing computational overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather than nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence. Unlike many existing methods for data analysis, our network architecture and learning rules are truly adaptive and are thus appropriate for real-time use."

In particular, we show how the VC dimension is affected by the introduction of a hint. We also derive a new quantity that defines a VC dimension for the hint itself. This quantity is used to estimate the number of examples needed to \"absorb\" the hint. We carry out the analysis for two types of hints, invariances and catalysts. We also describe how the same method can be applied to other types of hints."

These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses.\nOur methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosystems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory. In particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography.\nWe also apply our results to obtain strong intractability results for approximating a generalization of graph coloring."

The estimation of dynamical facial muscle contractions from video sequences of expressive human faces is considered.

Positive results are shown for significant subclasses that allow not only propositional predicates but also some relations. The algorithms are extended so as to be provably tolerant to a certain quantifiable error rate in the examples data. It is further shown that under certain restrictions on these subclasses the learning algorithms are well suited to implementation on neural networks of threshold elements. The possible importance of disjunctions of conjunctions as a knowledge representation stems from the observations that on the one hand humans appear to like using it andon the other, that there is circumstantial evidence that significantly larger classes may not be learnable in polynomial time. An NP-completeness result corroborating the latter is also presented."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learned using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. Although inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be learned, we show that there are some important nontrivial classes of propositional concepts that can be learned in a realistic sense."

Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering.

In particular, we formalize and develop algorithmic solutions to the following two questions: (1) How do we identify a bug in a program that behaves incorrectly? (2) How do we fix a bug, once one is identified? \nWe develop interactive diagnosis algorithms that identify a bug in a program that behaves incorrectly, and implement them in Prolog for the diagnosis of Prolog programs. Their performance suggests that they can be the backbone of debugging aids that go far beyond what is offered by current programming environments. \nWe develop an inductive inference algorithm that synthesizes logic programs from examples of their behavior. The algorithm incorporates the diagnosis algorithms as a component. It is incremental, and progresses by debugging a program with respect to the examples. The Model Inference System is a Prolog implementation of the algorithm. Its range of applications and efficiency is comparable to existing systems for program synthesis from examples and grammatical inference. \nWe develop an algorithm that can fix a bug that has been identified, and integrate it with the diagnosis algorithms to form an interactive debugging system. By restricting the class of bugs we attempt to correct, the system can debug programs that are too complex for the Model Inference System to synthesize."
