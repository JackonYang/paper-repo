                "text": "The Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform is known to have certain properties which make it \"optimal\" for many \"mean-square\" signal processing applications [1]-[4]. Recently, it has been shown that a class of digital images may be represented by a set of boundary value stochastic difference equations in two dimensions [5]-[7]. If the boundary conditions of this class of images are fixed, then these equations lead to a fast KL transform algorithm. Here this fast KL transform is used for Wiener filtering of images degraded by white or colored noise. Comparisons with \"Generalized Wiener Filtering\" [1] and conventional Fourier domain filtering are made. It is shown that the two-dimensional Wiener filter is nonseparable so that two-dimensional generalized Wiener filtering is more elaborate than reported in [1]. It is also shown that certain fast KL filters give better signal-to-noise ratio than the conventional Fourier domain Wiener filter and enable determination of an easily computable performance bound. Recursive filtering equations for implementing the fast KL filter on two-dimensional images including both white and colored noise cases are given. These results show that recursive filtering algorithms for images are faster than the transform-domain algorithms and the one-step interpolator algorithm performs very close to the smoothing filter and can be implemented online by introducing a one-step delay."

This definition in the homogeneous Gaussian case leads to a difference equation that sets forth the state of the field in terms of its values on a band of minimum width P , where P is the order of the process. The state of the field at position (i,j) is given by the set of values of the nearest neighbors within distance P of the point (i,j) .

The remainder of the correlogram tends to be analytically awkward but can be very easily calculated numerically. Three specific examples arising from the literature are discussed in detail."

The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width ($n$ atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case $n=\\ensuremath{\\infty}$ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies ($\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}J,\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}$) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature $T={T}_{c}$ given by the condition $sinh(\\frac{2J}{k{T}_{c}}) sinh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{k{T}_{c}})=1.$ The energy is a continuous function of $T$; but the specific heat becomes infinite as $\\ensuremath{-}log |T\\ensuremath{-}{T}_{c}|$. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with $log n$. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is ${(\\mathrm{exp} (\\frac{2J}{\\mathrm{kT}}) tanh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{\\mathrm{kT}}))}^{n}.$"
