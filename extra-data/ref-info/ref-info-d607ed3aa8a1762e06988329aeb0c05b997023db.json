                "text": "In this paper we present a general parsing strategy that arose from the development of an Earley-type parsing algorithm for TAGs (Schabes and Joshi 1988) and from recent linguistic work in TAGs (Abeille 1988).In our approach elementary structures are associated with their lexical heads. These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to a context-free grammar) over which constraints can be stated. These constraints either hold within the elementary structure itself or specify what other structures can be composed with a given elementary structure.We state the conditions under which context-free based grammars can be 'lexicalized' without changing the linguistic structures originally produced. We argue that even if one extends the domain of locality of CFGs to trees, using only substitution does not give the freedom to choose the head of each structure. We show how adjunction allows us to 'lexicalize' a CFG freely.We then show how a 'lexicalized' grammar naturally follows from the extended domain of locality of TAGs and present some of the linguistic advantages of our approach.A novel general parsing strategy for 'lexicalized' grammars is discussed. In a first stage, the parser builds a set structures corresponding to the input sentence and in a second stage, the sentence is parsed with respect to this set. The strategy is independent of the linguistic theory adopted and of the underlying grammar formalism. However, we focus our attention on TAGs. Since the set of trees needed to parse an input sentence is supposed to be finite, the parser can use in principle any search strategy. Thus, in particular, a top-down strategy can be used since problems due to recursive structures are eliminated. The parser is also able to use non-local information to guide the search.We then explain how the Earley-type parser for TAGs can be modified to take advantage of this approach."

The work on TAGS is motivated by linguistic considerations. However, a number of formal results have been established for TAGs, which we believe, would be of interest to researchers in tree grammars and tree automata. After giving a short introduction to TAG, we briefly state these results concerning both the properties of the string sets and tree sets (Section 2). We will also describe the notion of lexicalization of grammars (Section 3) and investigate the relationship of lexicalization to context-free grammars (CFGs) and TAGS (Section 4).

                "text": "Most current linguistic theories give lexical accounts of several phenomena that used to be considered purely syntactic. The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased both in amount and complexity. We explore the view that syntactic rules are not separated from lexical items. In this approach, each elementary structure is associated with a lexical item called the anchor. These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to context-free grammars) over which constraints can be stated. The 'grammar' consists of a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the anchor. There are 'rules' which tell us how these structures are composed. A grammar of this form will be said to be lexicalized. \nThe process of lexicalization of context-free grammars (CFGs) constrained by linguistic requirements forces us to use operations for combining structures that make the formalism fall in the class of mildly context sensitive languages. We show that substitution, the combining operation corresponding to CFGs, does not allow one to lexicalize CFGs but the combination of substitution and adjunction does. We show how tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) is derived from the lexicalization process of CFGs. Then we show that TAGs are closed under lexicalization and we illustrate the main structures found in a lexicalized TAG for English. The properties of TAGs permit us to encapsulate diverse syntactic phenomena in a very natural way. TAG's extended domain of locality and its factoring of recursion from local dependencies enable us to localize many syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap) as well as semantic dependencies (such as predicate-arguments). \nWe investigate the processing of lexicalized TAGs. We first present two general practical parsers that follow Earley-style parsing. They are practical parsers for TAGs because, as for CFGs, the average behavior of Earley-type parsers is superior to its worst case complexity. They are both left to right bottom-up parsers that use top-down predictions but they differ in the way the top down prediction is used. \nThen we explain the building of a set of deterministic bottom-up left to right parsers which analyze a subset of tree-adjoining languages. The LR parsing strategy for CFGs is extended to TAG by using a machine, called Bottom-up Embedded Push Down Automaton (BEPDA), that recognizes in a bottom-up fashion the set of tree-adjoining languages (and exactly this set). \nFinally we show how lexicalized grammars suggest a natural two-step parsing strategy. We consider lexicalized TAGs as an instance of lexicalized grammar and we examine the effect of the two-step parsing strategy on main types of parsing algorithms."

                "text": "Investigations of classes of grammars that are nontransformational and at the same time highly constrained are of interest both linguistically and mathematically. Context-free grammars (CFG) obviously form such a class. CFGs are not adequate (both weakly and strongly) to characterize some aspects of language structure. Thus how much more power beyond CFG is necessary to describe these phenomena is an important question. Based on certain properties of tree adjoining grammars (TAG) an approximate characterization of class of grammars, mildly context-sensitive grammars (MCSG), has been proposed earlier. In this paper, we have described the relationship between several different grammar formalisms, all of which belong to MCSG. In particular, we have shown that head grammars (HG), combinatory categorial grammars (CCG), and linear indexed grammars (LIG) and TAG are all weakly equivalent. These formalisms are all distinct from each other at least in the following aspects: (a) the formal objects and operations in each formalism, (b) the domain of locality over which dependencies are specified, (c) the degree to which recursion and the domain of dependencies are factored, and (d) the linguistic insights that are captured in the formal objects and operations in each formalism. A deeper understanding of this convergence is obtained by comparing these formalisms at the level of the derivation structures in each formalism. We have described a formalism, the linear context-free rewriting system (LCFR), as a first attempt to capture the closeness of the derivation structures of these formalisms. LCFRs thus make the notion of MCSGs more precise. We have shown that LCFRs are equivalent to muticomponent tree adjoining grammars (MCTAGs), and also briefly discussed some variants of TAGs, lexicalized TAGs, feature structure based TAGs, and TAGs in which local domination and linear precedence are factored TAG(LD/LP).

This paper presents a generalization of these algorithms to certain denumerable\u2010state, hidden Markov processes. This algorithm permits automatic training of the stochastic analog of an arbitrary context free grammar. In particular, in contrast to many grammatical inference methods, the new algorithm allows the grammar to have an arbitrary degree of ambiguity. Since natural language is often syntactically ambiguous, it is necessary for the grammatical inference algorithm to allow for this ambiguity. Furthermore, allowing ambiguity in the grammar allows errors in the recognition process to be explicitly modeled in the grammar rather than added as an extra component."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."

In particular, over 90% test set bracketing accuracy was achieved for grammars inferred by our algorithm from a training set of handparsed part-of-speech strings for sentences in the Air Travel Information System spoken language corpus. Finally, the new algorithm has better time complexity than the original one when sufficient bracketing is provided."
