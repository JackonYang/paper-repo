This paper proposes a method for representing some context information so that the correct meaning for a word in a sentence can be selected. The approach is primarily based on work by Waltz and Pollack (1985, 1984), who emphasized neutrally plausible systems. By contrast this paper focuses on computationally feasible methods applicable to full-scale natural language processing systems. There are two key elements: a collection of context vectors defined for every word used by a natural language processing system, and a context algorithm that computes a dynamic context vector at any position in a body of text. Once the dynamic context vector has been computed it is easy to choose among competing meanings for a word. This choice of definitions is essentially a neural network computation, and neural network learning algorithms should be able to improve such choices. Although context vectors do not represent all context information, their use should improve those full-scale systems that have avoided context as being too difficult to deal with. Good candidates for full-scale context vector implementations are machine translation systems and Japanese word processors. A main goal of this paper is to encourage such large-scale implementations and tests of context vector approaches. A variety of interesting directions for research in natural language processing and machine learning will be possible once a full set of context vectors has been created. In particular the development of more powerful context algorithms will be an important topic for future research."

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature."

The system offers insights into a variety of linguistic phenomena and allows easy testing of a variety of hypotheses.

Initially ambiguous and unstable, the network settles on a single interpretation, using a parallel, analog relaxation process. We also describe a parallel model for the representation of context and of the priming of concepts.

How do we know whether a noun phrase is a modifier of a preceding noun phrase or an argument of the verb? How do we select the correct meaning of each noun in the sentence, and how do we allow content to modulate its meaning? How do we know how to handle these new nouns and verbs? In this article we describe a simulation model that addresses these questions from a perspective quite different from the conventional perspective found in Computational Linguistics. Words are treated as patterns of activation, and knowledge about them is stored in distributed form, in the connections in a large network of simple neutron-like processing units. The model exhibits considerable facility in dealing with the problems of frame selection, role assignment, disambiguation, etc, and suggests a natural way to resolve unappealing aspects of the idea that there is a fixed set of individuated case roles. So far, our simulation model can only process one clause sentences. Possible extensions to multi-clause sentences are described."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

In the first method, a specific interest (or query) is taught to a Kohonen feature map. By using this network as a neural filter on a dynamic free-text database, only the associated subjects are selected from this database. The second method can be used in a more static environments. Statistical properties (n-grams) from various texts are taught to a feature map. A comparison of a query with this feature map results in the selection of texts with are closely related with respect to their contents. Both methods are compared with classical statistical information-retrieval algorithms. Various simulations show that the neural net converges towards a proper representation of the query as well as the objects in the database. The first algorithm exhibits much better scalability than its statistical counterparts, resulting in higher speeds, less memory needs, and easier maintainability. The second one shows an elegant and uniform generalization and association method, increasing the selection quality.<<ETX>>"

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.\nWe argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm."

We emphasize Lanczos and subspace iteration-based methods for determining several of the largest singular triplets (singular values and corresponding left- and right-singular vectors) for sparse matrices arising from two practical applications: information retrieval and seismic reflection tomography. The target architectures for our implementations are the CRAY-2S/4\u2013128 and Alliant FX/80. The sparse SVD problem is well motivated by recent information-retrieval techniques in which dominant singular values and their corresponding singular vectors of large sparse term-document matrices are desired, and by nonlinear inverse problems from seismic tomography applications which require approximate pseudo-inverses of large sparse Jacobian matrices. This research may help advance the development of future out-of-core sparse SVD methods, which can be used, for example, to handle extremely large sparse matrices 0 \u00d7 (106) rows or columns associated with extremely large databases in query-based information-retrieval applications."
