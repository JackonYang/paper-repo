The technique is applicable to complete images and to unlabeled feature sets derived from images, and with small modification may be used to transform images of unknown objects such that they represent images of those objects from a known orientation, for use in object identification. No knowledge of point correspondence between images is required. Theoretical development of the method and experimental results are presented. The method is shown to be computationally efficient, requiring O(N) multiplications and additions where, depending on the computation algorithm, N may equal the number of object or edge picture elements."

An algorithm is presented which optimally determines the saliency of boundary segments of one object with respect to those of a set of other objects.

The goal of these algorithms is to recognize the identity, position, and orientation of randomly oriented industrial parts. In one form this is commonly referred to as the \"bin-picking\" problem, in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2\u00bd-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems."

It covers even the most recent research and will provide a useful and current reference for professionals working in the fields of machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. \nAn outgrowth of the author's course at MIT, Robot Vision presents a solid framework for understanding existing work and planning future research. Its coverage includes a great deal of material that is important to engineers applying machine vision methods in the real world. The chapters on binary image processing, for example, help explain and suggest how to improve the many commercial devices now available. And the material on photometric stereo and the extended Gaussian image points the way to what may be the next thrust in commercialization of the results in this area. \nChapters in the first part of the book emphasize the development of simple symbolic descriptions from images, while the remaining chapters deal with methods that exploit these descriptions. The final chapter offers a detailed description of how to integrate a vision system into an overall robotics system, in this case one designed to pick parts out of a bin. \nThe many exercises complement and extend the material in the text, and an extensive bibliography will serve as a useful guide to current research. \nErrata (164k PDF)"

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

This technique is based on use of a synthetic attribute of an object, which we will call its footprint. Experimental results from databases of up to 100 objects are presented."
