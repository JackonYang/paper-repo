The goal of these methods is to discover automatically classification patterns that can be used for general document categorization or personalized filtering of free text. Previous reports indicate that human-engineered rule-based systems, requiring many man-years of developmental efforts, have been successfully built to \u201cread\u201d documents and assign topics to them. We show that machine-generated decision rules appear comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation. In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%. In the context of a very high-dimensional feature space, several methodological alternatives are examined, including universal versus local dictionaries, and binary versus frequency-related features."

We use a training set of manually categorized documents to learn word-category associations, and use these associations to predict the categories of arbitrary documents. Similarly, we use a training set of queries and their related documents to obtain empirical associations between query words and indexing terms of documents, and use these associations to predict the related documents of arbitrary queries. A Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique is employed to estimate the likelihood of these associations. Document collections from the MEDLINE database and Mayo patient records are used for studies on the effectiveness of our approach, and on how much the effectiveness depends on the choices of training data, indexing language, word-weighting scheme, and morphological canonicalization. Alternative methods are also tested on these data collections for comparison. It is evident that the LLSF approach uses the relevance information effectively within human decisions of categorization and retrieval, and achieves a semantic mapping of free texts to their representations in an indexing language. Such a semantic mapping lead to a significant improvement in categorization and retrieval, compared to alternative approaches."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

We first show that AdaBoost significantly outperforms another highly effective text filtering algorithm. We then compare AdaBoost and Rocchio over three large text filtering tasks. Overall both algorithms are comparable and are quite effective. AdaBoost produces better classifiers than Rocchio when the training collection contains a very large number of relevant documents.

We use a training set of texts with expert-assigned categories to construct a network which approximately reflects the conditional probabilities of categories given a text. The input nodes of the network are words in the training texts, the nodes on the intermediate level are the training texts, and the output nodes are categories. The links between nodes are computed based on statistics of the word distribution and the category distribution over the training set. ExpNet is used for relevance ranking of candidate categories of an arbitrary text in the case of text categorization, and for relevance ranking of documents via categories in the case of text retrieval. We have evaluated ExpNet in categorization and retrieval on a document collection of the MEDLINE database, and observed a performance in recall and precision comparable to the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping method, and significantly better than other methods tested. Computationally, ExpNet has an O(N 1og N) time complexity which is much more efficient than the cubic complexity of the LLSF method. The simplicity of the model, the high recall-precision rates, and the efficient computation together make ExpNet preferable as a practical solution for real-world applications."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

                "text": "This dissertation introduces a new theoretical model for text classification systems, including systems for document retrieval, automated indexing, electronic mail filtering, and similar tasks. The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods."

The performance of these algorithms degrades only logarithmically with the number of experts, making them particularly useful in applications where the number of experts is very large. However, in applications such as text categorization, it is often natural for some of the ex perts to abstain from making predictions on some of the instances. We show how to transform algorithms that assume that all experts are always awake to algorithms that do not require this assumption. We also show how to derive corresponding loss bounds. Our method is very general, and can be applied to a large family of online learning algorithms. We also give applications to various prediction models including decision graphs and \"switching\" experts."

We consider three classification techniques which have decision rules that are derived via explicit error minimization: linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We demonstrate that the classifiers perform 1015% better than relevance feedback via Rocchio expansion for the TREC-2 and TREC-3 routing tasks. Error minimization is difficult in high-dimensional feature spaces because the convergence process is slow and the models are prone to overfitting. We use two different strategies, latent semantic indexing and optimal term selection, to reduce the number of features. Our results indicate that features based on latent semantic indexing are more effective for techniques such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, which have no way to protect against overfitting. Neural networks perform equally well with either set of features and can take advantage of the additional information available when both feature sets are used as input."

It is assumed that the learner has reason to believe that one of some pool of known algorithms will perform well but does not know which one. A simple and effective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. It is called the weighted majority algorithm and is shown to be robust with respect to errors in the data. Various versions of the weighted majority algorithm are discussed, and error bounds for them that are closely related to the error bounds of the best algorithms of the pool are proved.<<ETX>>"

Keeping resource directories up-to-date is difficult because of the rapid growth in online documents. We propose using machine learning methods to address this problem. In particular, we propose to treat a resource directory as a list of positive examples of an unknown concept, and then use machine learning methods to construct from these examples a definition of the unknown concept. If the learned definition is in the appropriate form, it can be translated into a query, or series of queries, for a WWW search engine. This query can be used at a later date to detect any new instances of the concept. We present experimental results with two implemented systems, and two learning methods. One system is interactive, and is implemented as an augmented WWW browser; the other is a batch system, which can collect and label documents without any human intervention. The learning methods are the RIPPER rule learning system, and a rule-learning version of a new online weight allocation algorithm called the sleeping experts prediction algorithm. The experiments are performed on real data obtained from the WWW."

Instead, the probabiJit y estimates must be renormalized using logistic regression on the known relevance judgments. We examine more complex combination strat~ gies but find them less successful due to the high correlations among our filtering methods which are optimized over the same training data and employ similar document represerttations."

This paper defines and studies this bias. First, it is shown that any learning algorithm implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias requires \u0398(1/e ln 1/\u03b4+ 1/e[2p + p ln n]) training examples to guarantee PAC-learning a concept having p relevant features out of n available features. This bound is only logarithmic in the number of irrelevant features. The paper also presents a quasi-polynomial time algorithm, FOCUS, which implements MIN-FEATURES. Experimental studies are presented that compare FOCUS to the ID3 and FRINGE algorithms. These experiments show that-- contrary to expectations--these algorithms do not implement good approximations of MIN-FEATURES. The coverage, sample complexity, and generalization performance of FOCUS is substantially better than either ID3 or FRINGE on learning problems where the MIN-FEATURES bias is appropriate. This suggests that, in practical applications, training data should be preprocessed to remove irrelevant features before being given to ID3 or FRINGE."

                "text": "Shannon (1948) showed that a wide range of practical problems can be reduced to the problem of estimating probability distributions of words and ngrams in text. It has become standard practice in text compression, speech recognition, information retrieval and many other applications of Shannon\u2019s theory to introduce a \u2018\u2018bag-of-words\u2019\u2019 assumption. But obviously, word rates vary from genre to genre, author to author, topic to topic, document to document, section to section, and paragraph to paragraph. The proposed Poisson mixture captures much of this heterogeneous structure by allowing the Poisson parameter \u03b8 to vary over documents subject to a density function \u03c6. \u03c6 is intended to capture dependencies on hidden variables such genre, author, topic, etc. (The Negative Binomial is a well-known special case where \u03c6 is a \u0393 distribution.) Poisson mixtures fit the data better than standard Poissons, producing more accurate estimates of the variance over documents (\u03c3), entropy (H), inverse document frequency (IDF), and adaptation (Pr(x \u2265 2\uf8f4x \u2265 1 )). 1. Problem: Word Rates Are Highly Variable Many applications of statistical natural language processing make use of a so-called \u2018\u2018bag-of-words\u2019\u2019 assumption. Of course, is well known that word rates depend on many factors: genre, author, topic, etc. Table 1, for example, shows that \u2018\u2018said\u2019\u2019 is more frequent in some types of texts and less frequent in others. Table 1: Frequency of \u2018\u2018said\u2019\u2019 Depends on Source Source Freq per million words _ ______________________________________________ Department of Energy Abstracts 41 Groliers Encyclopedia 64 Federalist Papers 287 Hansard 1072 Harper & Row Books 1632 Brown Corpus 1645 Wall Street Journal 5600 Associated Press 1994 8514 Associated Press 1987 9525 Associated Press 1991 9861 Associated Press 1990 10,040 Associated Press 1989 10,195 Associated Press 1988 10,313 \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec The million-word Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982) was constructed in the 1960s to help researchers better understand how word rates vary from document to document and genre to genre. The corpus consists of 500 excerpts of approximately 2000 words each, selected from a wide variety of genres: Press (documents 1-88), Religion (89-105), Hobbies (106-141), Popular Lore (142-189), Belle-Lettres (190-264), Government and House Organs (265-294), Learned (295-374), Fiction (375-491), and Humor (492-500). Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that this structure has a dramatic impact on the frequency of \u2018\u2018said.\u2019\u2019 Figure 1 shows the frequency of \u2018\u2018said\u2019\u2019 in each of the 500 documents. Figure 2 is similar except that the Brown Corpus was replaced by a corpus of 500 documents randomly generated by a binomial distribution:"

Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes."

The agent maintains a separate hotlist (for links that were interesting) and coldlist (for links that were not interesting) for each topic. By analyzing the information immediately accessible from each link, the agent learns the types of information the user is interested in. This can be used to inform the user when a new interesting page becomes available or to order the user's exploration of unseen existing links so that the more promising ones are investigated first. We compare four different learning algorithms on this task. We describe an experiment in which a simple Bayesian classifier acquires a user profile that agrees with a user's judgment over 90% of the time."

Neural networks allow us to model higher-order interaction between document terms and to simultaneously predict multiple topics using shared hidden features. In the context of this model, we compare two approaches to dimensionality reduction in representation: one based on term selection and another based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Two diierent methods are proposed for improving LSI representations for the topic spotting task. We nd that term selection and our modiied LSI representations lead to similar topic spotting performance, and that this performance is equal to or better than other published results on the same corpus."

The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which \\separate and conquer\" rule learning induction methods scale up to large, real-world learning problems. In particular, we study the asymptotic complexity of rule induction on large training sets in the presence of noise. We present formal arguments and experimental data supporting the claim that existing methods do not scale up well on noisy data. We then present a solution in the form of new pruning techniques that dramatically improve the runtime of rule induction methods with no loss in accuracy: formal analysis shows an improvement in asymp-totic time complexity, and experiments show an order-of-magnitude speedup on a set of benchmark problems while obtaining slightly more accurate hypotheses."

The algorithms are the well-known Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and a new algorithm, which we call EG *. They both maintain a weight vector using simple updates. For the GD algorithm, the weight vector is updated by subtracting from it the gradient of the squared error made on a prediction multiplied by a parameter called the learning rate. The EG* uses the components of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case on-line loss bounds for EG* and compare them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that although the on-line losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, EG * has a much smaller loss if only few of the input variables are relevant for the predictions. Experiments show that the worst-case upper bounds are quite tight already on simple artificial data. Our main methodological idea is using a distance function between weight vectors both in motivating the algorithms and as a potential function in an amortized analysis that leads to worst-case loss bounds. Using squared Euclidean distance leads to the GD algorithm, and using the relative entropy leads to the EG* algorithm."

The model allows an algorithm to employ a rich vocabulary to describe the objects it encounters in the world without necessarily incurring time and space penalties so long as each individual object is relatively simple. We show that many of the basic Boolean functions learnable in standard theoretical models, such as conjunctions, disjunctions, K-CNF, and K-DNF, are still learnable in the new model, though by algorithms no longer quite so trivial as before. The new model forces algorithms for such classes to act in a manner that appears more natural for many learning scenarios."

The algorithms are the well-known Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and a new algorithm, which we call EG(+/-). They both maintain a weight vector using simple updates. For the GD algorithm, the update is based on subtracting the gradient of the squared error made on a prediction. The EG(+/-) algorithm uses the components of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case loss bounds for EG(+/-) and compare them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that the losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, but EG(+/-) has a much smaller loss if only a few components of the input are relevant for the predictions. We have performed experiments, which show that our worst-case upper bounds are quite tight already on simple artificial data."
