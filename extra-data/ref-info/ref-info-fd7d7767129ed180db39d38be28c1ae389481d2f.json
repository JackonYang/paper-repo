                "text": "I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each represen-tational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to lter\u00e0bstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle which aim at nding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e. codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for nding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for nding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The nal part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences."

The model can be represented by a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky. In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis. In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model. Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation. In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images."

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways."

The primary goal of an unsupervised learning procedure is to optimize the quality of a system's internal representation. In this thesis, we present a general framework for describing unsupervised learning procedures based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle states that the best model is one that minimizes the summed description length of the model and the data with respect to the model. Applying this approach to the unsupervised learning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracy of a representation (i.e., how concise a description of the input may be generated from it) and its succinctness (i.e., how compactly the representation itself can be described). \nViewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of the framework exposes their implicit assumptions about the type of structure assumed to underlie the data. While these existing algorithms typically minimize the data description using a fixed length representation, we use the framework to derive a class of objective functions for training self-supervised neural networks, where the goal is to minimize the description length of the representation simultaneously with that of the data. Formulating a description of the representation forces assumptions about the structure of the data to be made explicit, which in turn leads to a particular network configuration as well as an objective function that can be used to optimize the network parameters. We describe three new learning algorithms derived in this manner from the MDL framework. Each algorithm embodies a different scheme for describing the internal representation, and is therefore suited to a range of datasets based on the structure underlying the data. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms on some simple computational vision tasks."

The maximum likelihood fit of a model of this type suggests a \"softer\" form of competition, in which all competitors adapt in proportion to the relative probability that the input came from each competitor.

Occlusions and unreliable feature detectors often lead to situations where little or no direct information about features is available. However the available information is usually sufficient to highly constrain the outputs. We discuss Bayesian techniques for extracting class probabilities given partial data. The optimal solution involves integrating over the missing dimensions weighted by the local probability densities. We show how to obtain closed-form approximations to the Bayesian solution using Gaussian basis function networks. The framework extends naturally to the case of noisy features. Simulations on a complex task (3D hand gesture recognition) validate the theory. When both integration and weighting by input densities are used, performance decreases gracefully with the number of missing or noisy features. Performance is substantially degraded if either step is omitted."

Modulatory effects in neural responses have also been recently reported in a task where a monkey freely views a natural scene. In this article, we describe a hierarchical network model of visual recognition that explains these experimental observations by using a form of the extended Kalman filter as given by the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The model dynamically combines input-driven bottom-up signals with expectation-driven top-down signals to predict current recognition state. Synaptic weights in the model are adapted in a Hebbian manner according to a learning rule also derived from the MDL principle. The resulting prediction-learning scheme can be viewed as implementing a form of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The architecture of the model posits an active computational role for the reciprocal connections between adjoining visual cortical areas in determining neural response properties. In particular, the model demonstrates the possible role of feedback from higher cortical areas in mediating neurophysiological effects due to stimuli from beyond the classical receptive field. Simulations of the model are provided that help explain the experimental observations regarding neural responses in both free viewing and fixating conditions."

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes."

This paper describes an imaging model and an associated implementation strategy that: 1. Integrates scanned images, text, and synthetically generated graphics into a uniform device independent metaphor; 2.
