The feature of interest can described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image content, by evaluating the energy function and accordingly altering its parameter values. A gradient maximization technique is used to optimize the placement and shape of the deformable template to fit the desired anatomical feature. The final parameter values can be used as descriptors for the feature. Measurements of intensity values within a region of the template can be used as inputs to a medical diagnostic system. We have developed a Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) based image analysis program which employs the technique of deformable templates to localize features in dual energy CT images. Measurements can then be automatically made which can be used for maintenance of patients suffering from bone loss and abnormal marrow fat content. This system has been successfully tested on 552 (69 \u00d7 8) images and is currently in use at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Statistical comparisons between the system and previously used manual techniques show that their performances are practically equivalent and that the system has several advantages over the human operator, for example, consistency, accuracy and cost."

The geometric configuration is first extracted by fitting a deformable template to the shape of the feature (for example, an eye) in the image. This information is then used to geometrically normalize the image in such a way that the feature in the image attains a standard shape. The normalized image of the facial feature is then classified in terms of a set of principal components previously obtained from a representative set of training images of similar features. This classification stage yields a representation vector which can be used for recognition matching of the feature in terms of image detail alone without the complication of changes in facial expression. Implementation of the system is described and results are given for its application to a set of test faces. These results show that features can be reliably recognized using the representation vectors obtained.<<ETX>>"

The eye is modeled using a deformable template that specifies a parameterized geometry and an intensity model. The fit of the template is measured by a cost-functional employing robust estimators, i.e., (alpha) -trimmed means and variances, to overcome highlights, shadows, nonrigid boundaries, noise, and other such difficulties. Recognition proceeds in three stages. First, candidate eyes are located by matching a simplified eye model against the responses of a robust, general purpose detector of intensity valleys and peaks. Second, the best fit of each candidate eye is found by minimizing the energy of a cost functional. Third, each candidate is accepted or rejected based on the amount of variance in the image data it explains."

The algorithm requires the identification of symmetrical locations in the image, thus for each point at which depth is to be computed the corresponding symmetrical point must be visible in the image. The distance for which the camera is focused must also be known. The implementation of this algorithm is discussed and reconstructed shapes computed from real images are presented."

The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

In applications, we show how the morphological filters can be used to provide simple and systematic algorithms for image processing and analysis tasks as diverse as nonlinear image filtering; noise suppression; edge detection; region filling; skeletonization; coding; shape representation, smoothing, and recognition. In theory, we summarize the represen-tation of a large class of translation-invariant nonlinear filters (including morphological, median, order-statistics, and shape recognition filters) as a minimal combination of morphological erosions or dilations; these results provide new realizations of these filters and lead to a unified image alge-bra."

                "text": "Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology-Frank Y. Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

Given the positions of N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

                "text": "This paper analyzes the elastic net approach (Durbin and Willshaw 1987) to the traveling salesman problem of finding the shortest path through a set of cities. The elastic net approach jointly minimizes the length of an arbitrary path in the plane and the distance between the path points and the cities. The tradeoff between these two requirements is controlled by a scale parameter K. A global minimum is found for large K, and is then tracked to a small value. In this paper, we show that (1) in the small K limit the elastic path passes arbitrarily close to all the cities, but that only one path point is attracted to each city, (2) in the large K limit the net lies at the center of the set of cities, and (3) at a critical value of K the energy function bifurcates. We also show that this method can be interpreted in terms of extremizing a probability distribution controlled by K. The minimum at a given K corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimate of the tour under a natural statistical interpretation. The analysis presented in this paper gives us a better understanding of the behavior of the elastic net, allows us to better choose the parameters for the optimization, and suggests how to extend the underlying ideas to other domains."
