CHARM, too, uses the idea that items are composed of sets of features, making explicit the link between the vector elements in neural models and the features that have been proposed for psychological reasons, as was suggested by Estes (1979). Similarity is represented in CHARM in much the same way as it is in feature models\u2014that is, in terms of feature overlap\u2014and I showed that this variable produces a number of psychologically interesting results, such as the Osgood transfer surface, prototype formation, and intrusions in recall."

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe-memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe-memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with experimental data. The theory is applied to four item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study-test, and continuous) and to speed-accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme."

Convolution is used as the storage operation, and correlation is used as the retrieval operation. A distributed-memory system is assumed; all information is stored in a common memory vector. The theory applies to both recognition and recall and covers both accuracy and latency. Noise in the decision stage necessitates a two-criterion decision system, and over time the criteria converge until a decision is reached. Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory. Several alternative models with varying degrees of distributed memory are considered, and expressions for signal-to-noise ratio and relative efficiency are derived."

We demonstrate here that this finding does not necessarily indicate the existence, in memory, of a representation of the prototype. MINERVA, a computer-simulation model that encodes memory traces only of presented exemplars, was tested on an appropriate task. Differential forgetting of prototypes and old instances was shown by a version of the model that assumed that (1) classification is based on the exemplar trace most similar to the test stimulus and (2) individual properties are lost from the traces over time in an all-or-none fashion. It is suggested that, in general, the key to the prediction of differential forgetting may be the concomitance of forgetting and generalization."

A context theory of classificatio n is described in which judgments are assumed to derive exclusively from stored exemplar information. The main idea is that a probe item acts as a retrieval cue to access information associated with stimuli similar to the probe. The predictions of the context theory are contrasted with those of a class of theories (including prototype theory) that assume that the information entering into judgments can be derived from an additive combination of information from component cue dimensions. Across four experiments using both geometric forms and schematic faces as stimuli, the context theory consistently gave a better account of the data. The relation of the context theory to other theories and phenomena associated with ill-defined concepts is discussed in detail. One of the major components of cognitive behavior concerns abstracting rules and forming concepts. Our entire system of naming objects and events, talking about them, and interacting with them presupposes the ability to group experiences into appropriate classes. Young children learn to tell the difference between dogs and cats, between clocks and fans, and between stars and street lights. Since few concepts are formally taught, the evolution of concepts from experience with exemplars must be a fundamental learning phenomenon. The focus of the present article is to explore how such conceptual achievements emerge from individual instances."

                "text": "The last review of memory and verbal learning by Tulving & Madigan (180) painted a deeply pessimistic picture of the theoretical and experimental progress during the nearly 100 years of the post-Ebbinghaus era. As these critics saw it, tireless investigators compiled endless measurements of performance in labora\u00ad tory tasks which bear little or no relation to the complexities and subtleties of human memory. For the most part, the experiments demonstrated and quantified what Aristotle expounded in the remote days of antiquity-that memory is likely to reflect the contiguity and similarity of past events. While that proposition may have some empirical validity, it offers no purchase on the dynamics of remem\u00ad bering. Yet the students of learning and memory were excruciatingly slow to break out of the constraints imposed by the pretheoretical schema of mechanical chaining of mental representations. A discouraging manifestation of the futility of it all was the fact that laboratory procedures, such as serial and paired-associate learning, which obviously can be no more than a means to an end, became an object of experimental and theoretical analysis, i.e. an end by themselves. Thus it came about that in the middle of the twentieth century, man still thought \"about his own memory processes in terms readily translatable into ancient Greek\" (180, p. 437). It is only fair to add that the picture painted by Tulving and Madigan was not one of unrelieved gloom. They saw many promising leads as attention shifted away from the traditional problems of association to questions about the processing, storage, and retrieval of the multiplex information to which man is exposed both inside and outside the laboratory. This chapter is being written about 5 years after the last review, but the lines of historical development appear quite different to the present writer, and not only"

We assume that (a) nervous system activity is usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons; (b) different memory traces make use of the same synapses; and (c) synapses associate two patterns of neural activity by incrementing synaptic connectivity proportionally to the product of pre- and postsynaptic activity, forming a matrix of synaptic connectivities. We extend this model by (a) introducing positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (b) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. A hybrid model, partly analog and partly binary, arises. The system has certain characteristics reminiscent of analysis by distinctive features. Next, we apply the model to \"categorical perception.\" Finally, we discuss probability learning. The model can predict overshooting, recency data, and probabilities occurring in systems with more than two events with reasonably good accuracy."

Whether forgetting is conceptualized at a strict psychological level or at a neural level (e.g., neural memory trace), some provision is made for interference to account for at least some of the measured forgetting. The many studies on retroactive inhibition are probably responsible for this general agreement that interference among tasks must produce a sizable proportion of forgetting. By introducing an interpolated interfering task very marked decrements in recall can be produced in a few minutes in the laboratory. But there is a second generalization which has resulted from these studies, namely, that most forgetting must be a function of the learning of tasks which interfere with that which has already been learned (19). Thus, if a single task is learned in the laboratory and retention measured after a week, the loss has been attributed to the interference from activities learned outside the laboratory during the week. It is this generalization with which I am concerned in the initial portions of this paper. Now, I cannot deny the data which show large amounts of forgetting produced by an interpolated list in a few minutes in the laboratory. Nor do I deny that this loss may be attributed to interference. But I will try to show 1 Address of the president, Midwestern Psychological Association, St. Louis, Missouri,"

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

                "text": "ions and general knowledge more extensive than that of individual categories are required in any account of categorization. For example, Pittenger & Shaw (1975, Pittenger et al 1979) argue that higher order knowledge about transformations serves as the perceptual invariant under\u00ad lying certain types of categorization. In the tradition of constructive mem\u00ad ory research (e.g. Bartlett 1932, Bransford & McCarrell 1974), categories are treated as part of very general schemas. Finally, large scale computer models (Collins & Loftus 1975, Schank & Abelson 1977, Winograd 1 972) treat categories and categorization processes as inseparable from world knowledge and the inference processes used in such knowledge. DECOMPOSABILITY OF CATEGORIES INTO ELEMENTS Virtually all accounts of the representation and processing of categories assume that categories are decomposable into more elementary qualities. This is not surprising: as Dreyfus (1979) has pointed out, since the time of Plato one of the major aspects of what has been meant by an explanation has been the decomposition of the thing to be explained into its elements. In psychology, however, arguments against the indiscriminate use of expla\u00ad nation-by-decomposition have been with the field since its inception (see e.g. James 1 890a on the unitary nature of a single complex thought). The issue of decomposability was the focus of the debate in the early part of this century between the structuralists, who saw all experience as built out of primitive meaningless sensations, and the GestaItists, who emphasized irre\u00ad ducible emergent properties of wholes (see Boring 1 950). At present, while decomposition is the unmarked assumption in model building, the possible need for less analytic factors is periodically acknowl\u00ad edged. For example, in the pattern recognition literature, analysis into features and holistic matching to a template are generally presented as the two major types of alternative models (Reed 1 973), although for good reasons templates are usually treated as straw men (see Palmer 1978). CATEGORIZATION OF OBJECTS 105 Various empirical developments have brought the nature and role of decomposition into current debate. First, categorization has been investi\u00ad gated for types of stimuli that do not have obvious elements at a cognitive level. The most notable of these are color (Rosch 1 973b, 1974) and overall configuration (e.g. Attneave 1 957, Posner 1969, Lockhead 1 972-but see also Barresi et a1 1 975, Homa & Vosburgh 1976). It is not surprising that such stimuli do not strike us as obviously decomposible, since they are themselves normally treated as attributes, i.e. the qualities into which more complex objects are decomposed. There has also been considerable dis\u00ad agreement as to whether faces should be considered special holistically perceived objects (Hochberg & Galper 1 967, Yin 1 969, Rock 1973, Brad\u00ad shaw 1 976). A second development which has offered the opportunity to view categories as wholes is the possibility for spatial representation of withinand between-category structures through techniques such as mul\u00ad tidimensional scaling. For example, Hutchinson & Lockhead (1977) have argued that categories can best be conceived as unanalyzed points in metric multidimensional space. A third trend has been use of the concept of a prototype and the facts of gradients of representativeness to suggest holistic processing (e.g. Rosch 1973b, Dreyfus 1 979). The great majority of arguments over decomposition concern specifying the level of abstraction at which a particular kind of decomposition can or cannot be said to occur. While most categorization models include decom\u00ad position, it is never to the point of infinite regress. Some elements are included as the primitives, although usually by default, rather than by explicit labeling as primitives. Because some elements are not decomposed, many accounts of catego\u00ad rization include an explicit holistic component. For example, this can be introduced by means of a (relatively) holistic processing stage (E. E. Smith et al 1 974). Another possibility is that a given level of abstraction may be a basic and (potentially) holistically perceived level, even if other levels require more analytic mechanisms (Rosch et al 1 976a). Perceptual process\u00ad ing of figures (such as a large letter constructed of smaller letters) has been shown to proceed from global to local analysis under some stimulus condi\u00ad tions (Navon 1 977) but to proceed from local to global under others (e.g. Kinchla & Wolf 1979). In the perception models of Palmer (1975) and Winston ( 1975), the decomposition of a visual scene is viewed as a hierar\u00ad chical network of subscenes, and it is claimed that higher-order properties are processed first, followed by lower-order properties. Depending on the circumstances, however, a given aspect of a scene might be either the higheror the lower-order property. The controversy over lexical decompo\u00ad sition in linguistics and artificial intelligence (does \"kill\" really mean \"cause to die\") can be seen as largely an issue of which linguistic level to consider a whole and which to consider the elements (Fodor 1970; McCawley 1971,"

During recall, half of the Ss were administered the five stimulus words corresponding to the five R2 words of the second list (stimulated condition), and half did not receive the stimulus words (not-stimulated condition). The stimulus words were divisible into three categories, in effect varying the cultural associative probabilities at each retention interval. Altogether, there were 24 groups completing a 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 factorial design. The retention of R2s decreased with time and the effect of stimulation was to raise their level of production above groups not so stimulated. As R2s decreased with time, intrusions of R1s (primaries) and Ra-nS (sum of Ra to R n ) became more numerous where the cultural probabilities suggested this ought to happen. After 28 days, Ss still showed strong evidence of the training exposure but performance was more like that of free-associating Ss than that of shorter retention groups. In the not-stimulated condition, intrusions from unidentified sources (classified as Remainder) were more numerous the longer the retention interval. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that the amount of proactive interference via specific pre-experimental word-word habits increases as a function of time. An item analysis suggested a monotonic pattern of rs for forgetting under stimulated conditions, but not under conditions of free recall. This was interpreted to mean that forgetting when stimulated was more a process of complication than simplification and resembles a process sometimes found in motor-skills retention. Other correlational analyses proved useful tools for describing forgetting; questions pertaining to the behavior of items were quite as intriguing as those about Ss. Also, more variance could be accounted for after long than short retention intervals."

This intensity filter\u2014in imaging arrangements using coherent light sources\u2014has the property of forming a \u201cghost image\u201d of the whole object, when only a small fragment of the original object is shown.

The basic issue concerns to what extent theoretical conclusions based on such analyses are invariant under a class of \"informationally equivalent\" question transformations. First the notion of Boolean equivalence of two question sets is discussed. Then Lazarsfeld's latent structure analysis is considered in detail. It is discovered that the best fitting latent model depends on which one of the many informationally equivalent question sets is used. This fact raises a number of methodological problems and pitfalls with latent structure analysis. Related problems with other methodologies are briefly discussed."

The reason that the model generates Barnes and Underwood's finding becomes apparent when the particular features of B and D are considered. In all cases in the present simulation, Cue Item A produced a combination of B and D. If a feature happened randomly to have the same sign in B and D, then when the item produced by correlation was matched to all of the possibilities in the lexicon, this feature tended to favor the selection of both B and D. On those features where the signs of the values happened randomly to be different between B and D, the number of repetitions became especially important. Suppose, for instance, that the A-B association was repeated more frequently than was the A-D association. In this instance, the sign of the contrasting features tended to be that of the B item. Alternatively, if the A-D association was repeated more frequently, the sign of the contrasting features in the re-created item tended to favor selection of the D item. To give a specific example, suppose that feature n had a value of -1 in Item B and + 1 in Item D. If B had been presented only once whereas D had been repeated four times, the value of this feature in the reconstructed item would have been +3\u2014favoring D. Had B been repeated four times and D presented only once, the value would have been -3\u2014favoring B. Because nothing was done to alter the independence of the Lexical Items B and D, independence, as shown by Martin (1971), emerged as a natural consequence."

(1973) reported. These relations are basically the same as those revealed by Simulation 3, which investigated the efficacy of extralist cues, and may be viewed as manifestations of stimulus generalization. (The prototype was more similar to the presented exemplar than was the nonpresented exemplar by virtue of the way in which the exemplars were generated in the simulation and presumably in the experiment that it was designed to mimic.) One can also see from the results in Table 8 that when many exemplars were presented, the difference in correct responding between the prototype and the presented exemplar was decreased. In fact, in the high-similarity condition,- the prototype was actually more effective at producing the correct response than was a presented exemplar. This is not obvious from the recall data because of a ceiling effect but is readily apparent in the resonance scores. Also, new exemplars were consistently least effective at evoking correct recall. Again, this is not obvious from the percentage-correct scores in the high-similarity condition owing to a ceiling effect but can be deduced from the underlying resonance scores. On the whole, this simple simulation did a good job of producing the Z-shaped interaction found for correct classification when the type of probe (presented exemplar, prototype, and nonpresented exemplar) was crossed with the number of exemplars presented, as found by Homa et al. (1973)."
