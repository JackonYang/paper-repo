Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

As in previous methods, we first use training images to extract fragments that contain common object parts. We then show how these parts can be segmented into their figure and ground regions in an automatic learning process. This is in contrast with previous approaches, which required complete manual segmentation of the objects in the training examples. The figure-ground learning combines top-down and bottom-up processes and proceeds in two stages, an initial approximation followed by iterative refinement. The initial approximation produces figure-ground labeling of individual image fragments using the unsegmented training images. It is based on the fact that on average, points inside the object are covered by more fragments than points outside it. The initial labeling is then improved by an iterative refinement process, which converges in up to three steps. At each step, the figure-ground labeling of individual fragments produces a segmentation of complete objects in the training images, which in turn induce a refined figure-ground labeling of the individual fragments. In this manner, we obtain a scheme that starts from unsegmented training images, learns the figure-ground labeling of image fragments, and then uses this labeling to segment novel images. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned segmentation achieves the same level of accuracy as methods using manual segmentation of training images, producing an automatic and robust top-down segmentation."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

To this end, we derive an original version of EM which is able to fit one GMM per class based on partially labeled data. We also allow ourselves a small fraction of un-corrupted positive examples, thus obtaining an effective, yet cheap, slightly supervised learning. Proposed technique allows as well a saliency-based ranking and selection of learnt mixture components. Experiments show that both the semi-supervised GMM fitting with side information and the component selection are effective in identifying salient patches in the appearance of a class of objects. They are thus promising tools to learn class-specific models and detectors similar to those by Weber et al.[Unsupervised learning of models for recognition], but at a lower computational cost, while accommodating larger numbers of atomic parts."

                "text": "!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. Q 199s A&& prrss, IN."

Learning object-based appearance/shape models and estimating motion fields (deformation field) are highly interdependent problems. At the extreme, all motions can be represented as an excessively large set of appearance exemplars. However, a more efficient representation of a video sequence would save on frame description if it described the motion from the previous frame instead. The extreme in this direction is also problematic as there are usually causes of appearance variability other than motion. The flexible sprite model (Jojic and Frey 2001) illustrates the benefits of joint modelling of motion, shape and appearance using very simple models. The advantage of such a model is that each part of the model tries to capture some of the variability in the data until all the variability is decomposed and explained through either appearance, shape or transformation changes. Yet, the set of motions modelled is very limited, and the residual motion is simply captured in the variance maps of the sprites. In this paper, we develop a better balance between the transformation and appearance model by explicitly modelling arbitrary large, non-uniform motion."

This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of configurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images."

This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

While there have been many successful attempts to address these problems in application-specific settings, we believe that underlying a large set of problems in vision is a representational deficiency of intensity-derived local measurements that are the basis of most efficient models. We argue that interesting structure in images is better captured when the image is defined as a matrix whose entries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible intensities, colors or other features, much like the image representation often used to save on storage. In order to model the variability in images, we define an image class not by a single index map, but by a probability distribution over the index maps, which can be automatically estimated from the data, and which we call probabilistic index maps. The existing algorithms can be adapted to work with this representation, as we illustrate in this paper on the example of transformation-invariant clustering and background subtraction. Furthermore, the probabilistic index map representation leads to algorithms with computational costs proportional to either the size of the palette or the log of the size of the palette, making the cost of significantly increased invariance to non-structural changes quite bearable."

The model explains each input image as a layered composition of flexible sprites. A variational expectation maximization algorithm is used to learn a mixture of sprites from a video sequence. For each input image, probabilistic inference is used to infer the sprite class, translation, mask values and pixel intensities (including obstructed pixels) in each layer. Exact inference is intractable, but we show how a variational inference technique can be used to process 320/spl times/240 images at 1 frame/second. The only inputs to the learning algorithm are the video sequence, the number of layers and the number of flexible sprites. We give results on several tasks, including summarizing a video sequence with sprites, point-and-click video stabilization, and point-and-click object removal."

Learning is carried out by applying an augmented variational inference algorithm which includes a global search over a discretised transform space followed by a local optimisation. To aid correct convergence, we use bottom-up cues to restrict the space of possible affine transformations. We present results on a number of video sequences and show how the model can be extended to track an object whose appearance changes throughout the sequence."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

The feature of interest, an eye for example, is described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges, peaks, and valleys in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image by altering its parameter values to minimize the energy function, thereby deforming itself to find the best fit. The final parametr values can be used as descriptors for the feature. We illustrate this method by showing deformable templates detecting eyes and mouths in real images. We demonstrate their ability for tracking features."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We assume each factor has a small number of discrete states, and model it using a vector quantizer. The selected states of each factor represent the multiple causes of the input. Given a set of training examples, our model learns the association of data dimensions with factors, as well as the states of each VQ. Inference and learning are carried out efficiently via variational algorithms.

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case."

In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES ('Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS') which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."
