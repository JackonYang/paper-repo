The inferotemporal cortex (IT) has been thought to play an essential and specific role in visual object discrimination and recognition, because a lesion of IT in the monkey results in a specific deficit in learning tasks that require these visual functions. To understand the cellular basis of the object discrimination and recognition processes in IT, we determined the optimal stimulus of individual IT cells in anesthetized, immobilized monkeys. 2. In the posterior one-third or one-fourth of IT, most cells could be activated maximally by bars or disks just by adjusting the size, orientation, or color of the stimulus. 3. In the remaining anterior two-thirds or three-quarters of IT, most cells required more complex features for their maximal activation. 4. The critical feature for the activation of individual anterior IT cells varied from cell to cell: a complex shape in some cells and a combination of texture or color with contour-shape in other cells. 5. Cells that showed different types of complexity for the critical feature were intermingled throughout anterior IT, whereas cells recorded in single penetrations showed critical features that were related in some respects. 6. Generally speaking, the critical features of anterior IT cells were moderately complex and can be thought of as partial features common to images of several different natural objects. The selectivity to the optimal stimulus was rather sharp, although not absolute. We thus propose that, in anterior IT, images of objects are coded by combinations of active cells, each of which represents the presence of a particular partial feature in the image."

                "text": "We seek a general approach to determine what stimulus features visual neurons are sensitive to and how those features are represented by the neuron's responses. Because lesions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex interfere with a monkey's ability to perform pattern discrimination tasks we studied IT neurons. Previous single-unit studies have shown that IT neurons sometimes respond more strongly to complex stimuli (brushes, hands, faces) than to simple stimuli (bars, slits, edges). However, it is not known how specific stimulus parameters are represented by responses. We studied the responses of IT neurons in alert behaving monkeys to a large set of two-dimensional black and white patterns. The stimulus set was based on 64 Walsh functions that can be used to represent any picture with a resolution of one part in eight along each of two dimensions. The responses to these stimuli spanned a continuum from inhibition to strong excitation. A statistical test showed that the spike count was determined by which Walsh stimulus was presented. Hence, these stimuli form an adequate set for testing IT neurons. The responses showed temporal modulation of the spike train that could not be represented by a change in the spike count alone. Examples of this modulation were changes in latency, changes in the duration of the response, and alternating periods of excitation and inhibition. This temporal modulation may be important in representing stimulus parameters. The next paper in this series develops a method for quantifying this temporal modulation and shows that it is dependent on the stimulus. The third paper in this series shows that this temporal modulation contains more information about stimulus parameters than is contained in the spike count alone."

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \u201cdetectors\u201d for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

It is unclear, however, whether information with extremely high dimensions, such as visual shape, is organized in a similar columnar fashion or in a different manner in the brain.

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

We previously reported that in the anterior ventral temporal cortex of monkeys, individual neurons have a sustained activity that is highly selective for a few of the 100 coloured fractal patterns used in a visual working-memory task10. Here I report the development of this selectivity through repeated trials involving the working memory. The few patterns for which a neuron was conjointly selective were frequently related to each other through stimulus\u2013stimulus association imposed during training. The results indicate that the selectivity acquired by these cells represents a neuronal correlate of the associative long-term memory of pictures."

                "text": "1. Inferior temporal cortex (IT) is a \"high-order\" region of primate temporal visual cortex implicated in visual pattern perception and recognition. To gain some insight into the development of this area, we compared the properties of single neurons in IT in infant monkeys ranging from 5 wk to 7 mo of age with those of neurons in IT in adult animals. Both anesthetized and awake behaving paradigms were used. 2. In immobilized infant monkeys under nitrous oxide anesthesia, the incidence of visually responsive cells was markedly less than in adult monkeys studied under similar conditions. In infants 4-7 mo of age, only half of IT neurons studied were visually responsive, compared with > 80% in adult monkeys. In monkeys < 4 mo old, even fewer (< 10%) could be visually driven. \"Habituation\" of IT cells to repeated stimulus presentation appeared more pronounced in infant monkeys under nitrous oxide anesthesia than in adult animals. 3. IT cells in the anesthetized infant monkeys that did respond showed receptive field properties similar to those of responsive adult IT neurons studied under similar conditions. Two thirds of the receptive fields plotted in the anesthetized 4 to 7-mo-old group were bilateral, and median field size did not differ between the infants and comparable adult groups, being approximately 20 degrees on a side in each case. 4. In contrast to the results obtained under anesthesia, most IT cells in alert infant monkeys 5 wk-7 mo of age (80%) were responsive to visual stimuli, and this incidence of visually responsive IT neurons did not differ from that obtained in awake adult macaques. However, response magnitude, measured as spikes per second above baseline rate, was significantly lower in the infant alert sample than in the adult control (5.2 vs. 12.6 spikes/s, mean +/- SE, deviation from spontaneous rate, respectively). 5. In addition to having lower magnitudes of visual response, IT cells in the awake infants also tended to have longer and more variable latencies. The overall mean for the infant cells was 196 ms, compared with an overall mean of 140 ms for IT neurons in the alert control adult. 6. Although the magnitude of response of neurons in alert infant IT cortex was lower overall, the incidence and features of stimulus selectivity shown by alert infant IT neurons were strikingly similar to those of IT cells of both anesthetized and unanesthetized adult monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Cells responsive to the sight of the entire human body (but no to control stimuli) were tested with two subregions (head alone with the body occluded from sight and the body alone with the head occluded). Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded to the whole body and to one of the two body regions tested separately: 72% (17 of 22) responding to the head and 28% (5 of 22) to the rest of the body. Forty-two percent (22 of 53) of cells responded independently to both regions of the body when tested in isolation. The remaining cells (17%, 9 of 53) were selective for the entire body and unresponsive to component parts. The majority of cells tested (90%, 35 of 39) were selective for perspective view (e.g., some cells respond optimally to the side view of the body, others to the back view). Comparable levels of view sensitivity were found for responses to the whole body and its parts. Results indicate (1) separate neuronal analysis of body parts and (2) extensive integration of information from different parts. Contrary to influential models of object recognition (Marr and Nishihara, 1978; Biederman, 1987), the results indicate view-specific processing both for the appearance of separate object components and for integration of information across components."

                "text": "1. The responses of single neurons in the inferior temporal cortex and the cortex in the banks of the anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus of three awake, behaving macaques were recorded during a visual fixation task. Stimulus images subtending 17 or 8.5 degrees were presented in the center of the display area, and fixation was either at the center of the display area, or at one of four positions that were on the stimulus, or several degrees off the edge of the test stimulus. The experiments were performed with face-selective cells, and the responses were compared for fixation at each position for both effective and noneffective face stimuli for each cell. 2. The firing rates of most neurons to an effective image did not significantly alter when visual fixation was as far eccentric as the edge of the face, and they showed only a small reduction when the fixation point was up to 4 degrees from the edge of the face. Moreover, stimulus selectivity across faces was maintained throughout this region of the visual field. 3. The centers of the receptive fields of the cells, as shown by the calculated \"centers of gravity,\" were close to the fovea, with almost all being within 3 degrees of the fovea. 4. The receptive fields of the cells typically crossed the vertical midline for at least 5 degrees. 5. Information theory procedures were used to analyze the spike trains of the visual neurons. Nearly six times more information was carried by these neurons' firing rate about the identity of an image than about its position in the visual field. Thus the information theory analysis showed that the responses of these neurons reflected information about which stimulus had been seen in a relatively translation invariant way. 6. Principal component analysis showed that principal component 1 (PC1) is related primarily to firing rate and reflected information primarily about stimulus identity. (For identity PC2 added only 14% more information to that contained in PC1.) Principal component 2 (PC2) was more closely related to neuronal response latencies, which increased with increasing eccentricity of the image in the visual field. PC2 reflected information about the position of the stimulus in the visual field, in that PC2 added 109% more information to that contained in PC1 about the position of the stimulus in the visual field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "Does the human brain represent objects for recognition by storing a series of two-dimensional snapshots, or are the object models, in some sense, three-dimensional analogs of the objects they represent? One way to address this question is to explore the ability of the human visual system to generalize recognition from familiar to unfamiliar views of three-dimensional objects. Three recently proposed theories of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional models [Ullman, S. (1989) Cognition 32, 193-254], linear combination of two-dimensional views [Ullman, S. & Basri, R. (1990) Recognition by Linear Combinations of Models (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge), A. I. Memo No. 1152], and view approximation [Poggio, T. & Edelman, S. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 263-266]--predict different patterns of generalization to unfamiliar views. We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models."

We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition."

                "text": "The direction of eye gaze and orientation of the face towards or away from another are important social signals for man and for macaque monkey. We have studied the effects of these signals in a region of the macaque temporal cortex where cells have been found to be responsive to the sight of faces. Of cells selectively responsive to the sight of the face or head but not to other objects (182 cells) 63% were sensitive to the orientation of the head. Different views of the head (full face, profile, back or top of the head, face rotated by 45\u00b0 up to the ceiling or down to the floor) maximally activated different classes of cell. All classes of cell, however, remained active as the preferred view was rotated isomorphically or was changed in size or distance. Isomorphic rotation by 90\u2013180\u00b0 increased cell response latencies by 10\u201360 ms. Sensitivity to gaze direction was found for 64% of the cells tested that were tuned to head orientation. Eighteen cells most responsive to the full face preferred eye contact, while 18 cells tuned to the profile face preferred averted gaze. Sensitivity to gaze was thus compatible with, but could be independent of, sensitivity to head orientation. Results suggest that the recognition of one type of object may proceed via the independent high level analysis of several restricted views of the object (viewer-centred descriptions)."

We have investigated the sensitivity of such cells to different viewing conditions to determine the frame(s) of reference utilized in processing. The responses of the majority of cells in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (areas TPO and PGa) found to be sensitive to static and dynamic information about the body were selective for one perspective view (e.g. right profile, reaching right or walking left). These cells can be considered to provide viewer-centred descriptions because they depend on the observer's vantage point. Viewer-centred descriptions could be used in guiding behaviour. They could also be used as an intermediate step for establishing view-independent responses of other cell types which responded to many or all perspective views selectively of the same object (e.g. head) or movement. These cells have the properties of object-centred descriptions, where the object viewed provides the frame of reference for describing the disposition of object parts and movements (e.g. head on top of shoulders, reaching across the body, walking forward 'following the nose'). For some cells in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (area TEa) the responses to body movements were related to the object or goal of the movements (e.g. reaching for or walking towards a specific place). This goal-centred sensitivity to interaction allowed the cells to be selectively activated in situations where human subjects would attribute causal and intentional relationships."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

Psychologists and neurophysiologists have been particularly puzzled by the extreme difficulty children and other animals have in learning to distinguish left-right mirror images. The authors propose an explanation of why mirror images are so confusing. In the natural world almost all mirror images are actually two aspects of the same object, for example, the two sides of a face or a silhouette viewed from the front and back. Therefore a perceptual mechanism that treats mirror images as equivalent would be adaptive. The perceptual equivalence of mirror images only becomes maladaptive or confusing under very special conditions. One of these is learning an orthography containing mirror images such as b and d. Difficulty in learning to read, may, in part, be due to difficulty in overcoming the normal tendency to treat mirror images as the same stimulus.  In the final portion of the paper the authors consider the effects of mirror-reversing a painting and, more generally, left and right in pictorial space.

First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

One theory is that the visual system describes the object relative to a reference frame centered on the object, resulting in a representation that is invariant across orientations. Chronometric data show that this is true only when an object can be identified uniquely by the arrangement of its parts along a single dimension. When an object can only be distinguished by an arrangement of its parts along more than one dimension, people mentally rotate it to a familiar orientation. This finding suggests that the human visual reference frame is tied to egocentric coordinates."

                "text": "Tarr and Pinker (1989, 1990) delineated the conditions in which the orientation of a shape affects the time subjects take to recognize it. Relatively large effects of orientation were found (1) when misoriented asymmetrical shapes were unfamiliar, and (2) when familiar asymmetrical shapes appeared in unfamiliar orientations. In contrast, relatively small effects or no effect of orientation were found (1) when familiar asymmetrical shapes appeared at familiar orientations, (2) when unfamiliar mirror-reversals of familiar asymmetrical shapes appeared at unfamiliar orientations, (3) for misoriented symmetrical shapes, whether they were unfamiliar or familiar, and (4) for misoriented bilaterally redundant shapes, whether they were unfamiliar or familiar. To account for these data, two questions must be addressed: What mental processes underlie large effects of orientation or their absence; and why do these two patterns of data depend on manipulations of familiarity, handedness, and shape geometry? In Tarr and Pinker (1989, 1990) we proposed a theory that simultaneously answered both of these questions {what processes are used when very small effects of orientation are observed, and when are these processes used). The theory, multiple-views-plus-transformation, suggests that large effects of orientation in shape recognition are due to mental rotation. Crucially, this conclusion is based not only on the presence of an orientation effect, but on the similarity between our rotation rates and the rates observed in experiments by Shepard and Cooper (1982). These experiments used independent evidence to demonstrate the existence of an incremental mental rotation transformation, not confined to the effects of orientation, but depending on converging manipulations such as response time to probes at intermediate orientations and presentation points, effects of advance information and preparation time, and other techniques. We suggested that the absence of such large effects of orientation may result from orientation-invariant mechanisms of three kinds: orientation-specific representations of familiar shapes at familiar orientations; a 180\u00b0 rotation in depth to align unfamiliar mirror-reversals with their familiar standards; and \\Vi D orientation-independent descriptions for symmetrical and bilaterally redundant shapes. Together these hypotheses not only explain the causes of the absence of mental-rotation-size orientation"

Whether these judgments were left-right mirror-image discriminations (b vs. d or p vs. q) or up-down mirror-image discriminations (b vs. p or d vs. q), the subjects' reaction times increased sharply with the angular departure of each letter from its designated normal upright orientation, a fact implying mental rotation. This was so whether the subjects responded with the letter labels themselves (e.g., b vs. d) or with the labels left versus right or top versus bottom. It was again the case when the letters were replaced by nonletter forms, in which event there was also a left visual-field advantage in reaction time. This study is therefore the first to demonstrate a mental-rotation strategy when the canonical forms to be discriminated are up-down mirror images as well as when they are left-right mirror images. In both cases, however, the task requires the ability to tell left from right, and we suggest that this is the critical ingredient that induces mental rotation."

                "text": "Even if represented in a way which is invariant to illumination conditions, a 3D object gives rise to an infinite number of 2D views, depending on its pose. It has been recently shown ([13]) that it is possible to synthesize a module that can recognize a specific 3D object from any viewpoint, by using a new technique of learning from examples, which are, in this case, a small set of 2D views of the object. In this paper we extend the technique, a) to deal with real objects (isolated paper clips) that suffer from noise and occlusions and b) to exploit negative examples during the learning phase. We also compare different versions of the multi-layer networks corresponding to our technique among themselves and with a standard Nearest Neighbor classifier. The simplest version, which is a Radial Basis Functions network, performs less well than a Nearest Neighbor classi-fier. The more powerful versions, trained with positive and negative examples, perform significantly better. Our results, which may have interesting implications for computer vision despite the relative simplicity of the task studied, are especially interesting for understanding the process of object recognition in biological vision. 1 Introduction Shape-based visual recognition of 3D objects may be solved by first hypothesizing the viewpoint (e.g., using information on feature correspondences between the image and a 3D model), then computing the appearance of the model of the object to be recognized from that viewpoint and comparing it with the actual image ([6; 20; 9; 11; 21]). Most recognition schemes developed in computer vision over the last few years employ 3D models of objects. Automatic learning of 3D models, however, is in itself a difficult problem that has not been much addressed in the past and which presents difficulties, especially for any theory that wants to account for human ability in visual recognition. Recently, recognition schemes have been suggested that, relying on a set of 2D views of the object instead of a 3D model ([2; 5; 13]), offer a natural solution to the problem of model acquisition. In particular, Poggio and Edelman ([13]) have argued that for each object there exists a smooth function mapping any perspective view into a \"standard\" view of the object and that this mul-tivariate function may be approximatevely synthesized from a small number of views of the object. Such a function would be object specific, with different functions corresponding to different 3D objects. \u2026"

In one experiment, novel two-dimensional wire figures were first shown in one orientation in the sagittal plane, and recognition of them was then tested in an altered orientation in that plane. In another experiment, novel three-dimensional wire figures were first shown in one orientation, and recognition of them was tested following rotation about one of the three major axes of space. The guiding hypotheses were (a) form perception is the end result of a process of figural description; (b) orientation change that alters the perceived location of the top, bottom, and sides of a figure will affect this description; and (c) front-back reversal and rotations about the Y axis will not affect the description because front and back constitute the sides of a figure much as left and right do, and all figural sides are phenomenally equivalent. The findings support these hypotheses except for an unanticipated effect on recognition of 90 degrees rotations about the Y axis. This effect was seen as a hitherto unknown example of egocentrism in perception, since the description is governed by the retinal projection resulting from the particular vantage point of the observer."

From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization theory. A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks or hyper basis functions. These networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines but are also closely related to the classical radial basis functions used for interpolation tasks and to several pattern recognition and neural network algorithms. They also have an interesting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are synthesized and optimally combined during the learning stage."

Orton (The Journal, April 7, p. 1095) entitled as above, and finding, throughout, the evidence of careful psychologic study as well as of shrewd clinical insight, I am the more surprised at one or two examples of what, to me at least, appear as instances of faulty logic, medical as well as dialectic. Thus, as to the general assumption that defective readers are generally also mentally defective, we note the following: \"Very often the logic of this explanation forms a typical vicious circle. The child is said to be feebleminded because he cannot learn to read, and his inability to learn to read is said to be because he is feebleminded\" [italics, mine]. Surely, here is a dialectic straw man\u2014erected quite unintentionally I am willing to believe\u2014which Dr. Orton then upsets. The fallacy or catch is"

These order statistic tests were found to be very efficient for small samples from a normal population; also they can be applied with very little computation. This paper contains applications of these tests to several well known statistical problems. Also a graphical method of applying the tests of [1] is outlined. * The results presented in this paper were obtained in the course of research conducted under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research. This research was performed while the author was at Princeton University."
