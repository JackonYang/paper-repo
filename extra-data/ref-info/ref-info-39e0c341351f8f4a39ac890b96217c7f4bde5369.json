One of the most promising directions for unsupervised learning may lie in Deep Learning methods, given their success in supervised learning. However, one of the current problems with deep unsupervised learning methods, is that they often are harder to scale. As a result there are some easier, more scalable shallow methods, such as the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Student-t Mixture Model, that remain surprisingly competitive. In this paper we propose a new scalable deep generative model for images, called the Deep Gaussian Mixture Model, that is a straightforward but powerful generalization of GMMs to multiple layers. The parametrization of a Deep GMM allows it to efficiently capture products of variations in natural images. We propose a new EM-based algorithm that scales well to large datasets, and we show that both the Expectation and the Maximization steps can easily be distributed over multiple machines. In our density estimation experiments we show that deeper GMM architectures generalize better than more shallow ones, with results in the same ballpark as the state of the art."

However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by \u2018training them discriminatively\u2019, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a \u2018discriminatively trained\u2019 generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of \u2018discriminative training\u2019, this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that, when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative."

We formulate a method that generates an independent sample via a single feedforward pass through a multilayer perceptron, as in the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Training a generative adversarial network, however, requires careful optimization of a difficult minimax program. Instead, we utilize a technique from statistical hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which leads to a simple objective that can be interpreted as matching all orders of statistics between a dataset and samples from the model, and can be trained by backpropagation. We further boost the performance of this approach by combining our generative network with an auto-encoder network, using MMD to learn to generate codes that can then be decoded to produce samples. We show that the combination of these techniques yields excellent generative models compared to baseline approaches as measured on MNIST and the Toronto Face Database."

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to \u00bd everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples."

Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multidimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting."

Here we propose a new parameter estimation technique that does not require computing an intractable normalization factor or sampling from the equilibrium distribution of the model. This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as the objective the minimization of the KL divergence between the data distribution and the distribution produced by running the dynamics for an infinitesimal time. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning technique. We demonstrate parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief networks and an independent component analysis model of natural scenes. In the Ising model case, current state of the art techniques are outperformed by at least an order of magnitude in learning time, with lower error in recovered coupling parameters."

The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

So far, these models have arguably been relatively successful on tasks such as modeling handwritten digits (MNIST), small image patches (e.g., 8 by 8 pixels) and other low-dimensional datasets. \nHowever, convincingly modeling higher dimensional data such as small images (e.g., 32 by 32 pixels and higher) is still a big unsolved problem. \nIn this work we will extend and apply Deep Gaussian Mixture Models (DGMMs) to this task, by introducing locally connected transformations. Similarly to convolutions in deep neural networks, local connectivity in DGMMs allow us to train faster and with less overfitting than fully connected networks when applied to images. Our experiments show the benefits of using \nlocally-connected Deep GMMs and give new insights on modeling higher dimensional images."

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data."

The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity. We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance. In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field."

Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11]. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset."

We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic\u2014informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. [2]. We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. [1], in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD."

Research in the last decades has established that much of the underlying computations take place in a hierarchical fashion along the ventral visual pathway. However, the exact processing stages along this hierarchy are difficult to characterise. Here we present a method to generate stimuli that will allow a principled description of the processing stages along the ventral stream. We introduce a new parametric texture model based on the powerful feature spaces of convolutional neural networks optimised for object recognition. We show that constraining a spatial summary statistic over feature maps suffices to synthesise high-quality natural textures. Moreover we establish that our texture representations continuously disentangle high-level visual information and demonstrate that the hierarchical parameterisation of the texture model naturally enables us to generate novel types of stimuli for systematically probing mid-level vision."

Supporting this hypothesis, several probabilistic models of local natural image regularities have been proposed that reproduce neural response properties. Although many such physiological links have been made, these models have not been linked directly to visual sensitivity. Previous psychophysical studies of sensitivity to natural image regularities focus on global perception of large images, but much less is known about sensitivity to local natural image regularities. We present a new paradigm for controlled psychophysical studies of local natural image regularities and compare how well such models capture perceptually relevant image content. To produce stimuli with precise statistics, we start with a set of patches cut from natural images and alter their content to generate a matched set whose joint statistics are equally likely under a probabilistic natural image model. The task is forced choice to discriminate natural patches from model patches. The results show that human observers can learn to discriminate the higher-order regularities in natural images from those of model samples after very few exposures and that no current model is perfect for patches as small as 5 by 5 pixels or larger. Discrimination performance was accurately predicted by model likelihood, an information theoretic measure of model efficacy, indicating that the visual system possesses a surprisingly detailed knowledge of natural image higher-order correlations, much more so than current image models. We also perform three cue identification experiments to interpret how model features correspond to perceptually relevant image features."

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm."

To allow finer control over the behavior of the models, we add a regularization term inspired by techniques used for regularizing certain types of policy search in reinforcement learning.

This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the multidisciplinary field of natural image statistics. The book starts with a review of background material in signal processing and neuroscience, which makes it accessible to a wide audience. The book then explains both the basic theory and the most recent advances in a coherent and user-friendly manner.

Samples from the model are of high perceptual quality demonstrating the generative power of neural networks trained in a purely discriminative fashion. Within the model, textures are represented by the correlations between feature maps in several layers of the network. We show that across layers the texture representations increasingly capture the statistical properties of natural images while making object information more and more explicit. The model provides a new tool to generate stimuli for neuroscience and might offer insights into the deep representations learned by convolutional neural networks."

We have also reviewed emerging alternative signal fidelity measures and discussed their potential application to a wide variety of problems. The message we are trying to send here is not that one should abandon use of the MSE nor to blindly switch to any other particular signal fidelity measure. Rather, we hope to make the point that there are powerful, easy-to-use, and easy-to-understand alternatives that might be deployed depending on the application environment and needs. While we expect (and indeed, hope) that the MSE will continue to be widely used as a signal fidelity measure, it is our greater desire to see more advanced signal fidelity measures being used, especially in applications where perceptual criteria might be relevant. Ideally, the performance of a new signal processing algorithm might be compared to other algorithms using several fidelity criteria. Lastly, we hope that we have given further motivation to the community to consider recent advanced signal fidelity measures as design criteria for optimizing signal processing algorithms and systems. It is in this direction that we believe that the greatest benefit eventually lies."

We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints, by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint, and we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular, we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set.

We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce Markov chains that mix faster between modes. Consequently, mixing between modes would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand this, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing between modes and interpolating between samples."

The algorithm patches up holes in images by finding similar image regions in the database that are not only seamless, but also semantically valid. Our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite, the space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large. For many image completion tasks, we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments that will convincingly complete the image. Our algorithm is entirely data driven, requiring no annotations or labeling by the user. Unlike existing image completion methods, our algorithm can generate a diverse set of image completions and we allow users to select among them. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing image completion approaches."

By adding the right amount of noise to a standard stochastic gradient optimization algorithm we show that the iterates will converge to samples from the true posterior distribution as we anneal the stepsize. This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an inbuilt protection against overfitting. We also propose a practical method for Monte Carlo estimates of posterior statistics which monitors a \"sampling threshold\" and collects samples after it has been surpassed. We apply the method to three models: a mixture of Gaussians, logistic regression and ICA with natural gradients."

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system."

                "text": "the selection of symmetric factorial designs, that is, a design where all factors have the same number of levels. Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."

The first test is based on a large deviation bound for the test statistic, while the second is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in O(m2) time. We apply our approach to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where our test performs strongly. We also demonstrate excellent performance when comparing distributions over graphs, for which no alternative tests currently exist."

Our model complements existing memory architectures with dynamic entity tracking by explicitly modeling actions as state transformers. The model updates the states of the entities by executing learned action operators. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model can reason about the unstated causal effects of actions, allowing it to provide more accurate contextual information for understanding and generating procedural text, all while offering more interpretable internal representations than existing alternatives."

Before this paper, most people believed that the only way to make the error probability of transmission as small as desired is to reduce the data rate (such as a long repetition scheme). However, surprisingly this paper revealed that it does not need to reduce the data rate for achieving that much of small errors. It proved that we can get some positive data rate that has the same small error probability and also there is an upper bound of the data rate, which means we cannot achieve the data rate with any encoding scheme that has small enough error probability over the upper bound."
