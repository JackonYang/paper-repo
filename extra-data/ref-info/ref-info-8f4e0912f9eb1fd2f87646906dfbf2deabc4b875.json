All information sources, from geometric features and spatial relations to the textual features and content are employed in the analysis. To deal effectively with these information sources, we define a document representation general and flexible enough to represent complex documents. To handle such a broad document class, it uses generic document knowledge only, which is identified explicitly. The proposed system inte- grates components based on computer vision, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing techniques. The system is fully implemented and experimental re- sults on heterogeneous collections of documents for each component and for the entire system are presented."

In this work we are concerned with automatic classification of such documents. This task is usually accomplished by extracting a suitable set of low-level features from each document which are then fed to a classifier. The quality of the results depends primarily on the classifier, but they are also heavily influenced by the specific features used. In this work we focus on the feature extraction part and propose a method that characterizes each document based on the spatial density of black pixels and of image edges. We assess our proposal on a real-world dataset composed of 560 invoices belonging to 68 different classes. These documents have been digitalized after their printed counterparts have been handled by a corporate environment, thus they contain a substantial amount of noise\u2014big stamps and handwritten signatures at unfortunate positions and so on. We show that our proposal is accurate, even a with very small learning set."

The methods are useful for visual similarity based document retrieval as well as fast algorithms for initial document type classification without OCR. A novel feature set called interval encoding is introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors by capturing structural characteristics of the image. These fixed-length vectors are then compared to each other through a Manhattan distance computation for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their layout similarity to a test document. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the features derived from interval coding in a hidden Markov model based page layout classification system that is trainable and extendible. The methods described in the paper can be used in various document retrieval tasks including visual similarity based retrieval, categorization and information extraction."

This paper describes a way to use layout information for document image retrieval instead. A new class of distance measures is introduced for documents with Manhattan layouts, based on a two-step procedure: First, the distances between the blocks of two layouts are calculated. Then, the blocks of one layout are assigned to the blocks of the other layout in a matching step. Different block distances and matching methods are compared and evaluated using the publicly available MARG database. On this dataset, the layout type can be determined successfully in 92.6% of the cases using the best distance measure in a nearest neighbor classifier. The experiments show that the best distance measure for this task is the overlapping area combined with the Manhattan distance of the corner points as block distance together with the minimum weight edge cover matching"

To handle these documents automatically, logical structure information is necessary. In this paper, we first analyze the elements of the form documents from a communication point of view and retrieve the grammatical elements that appear in them. Then, we present a document structure grammar which governs the logical structure of the form documents. Finally, we propose a structure analysis system of the table form documents based on the grammar. By using grammar notation, we can easily modify and keep it consistent, as the rules are relatively simple. Another advantage of using grammar notation is that it can be used for generating documents only from logical structure. In our system, documents are assumed to be composed of a set of boxes and they are classified as seven box types. Then the box relations between the indication box and its associated entry box are analyzed based on the semantic and geometric knowledge defined in the document structure grammar. Experimental results have shown that the system successfully analyzed several kinds of table forms."

In this work we consider a dynamic scenario in which document classes are not known a priori and new classes can appear at any time. This open world setting is both realistic and highly challenging. We use an SVM-based classifier based only on image-level features and use a nearest-neighbor approach for detecting new classes. We assess our proposal on a real-world dataset composed of 562 invoices belonging to 68 different classes. These documents were digitalized after being handled by a corporate environment, thus they are quite noisy---e.g., big stamps and handwritten signatures at unfortunate positions and alike. The experimental results are highly promising."

We propose modeling the document's layout by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields. This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms, based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with connectionist models.

There is great diversity in document image classifiers: they differ in the problems they solve, in the use of training data to construct class models, and in the choice of document features and classification algorithms. We survey this diverse literature using three components: the problem statement, the classifier architecture, and performance evaluation. This brings to light important issues in designing a document classifier, including the definition of document classes, the choice of document features and feature representation, and the choice of classification algorithm and learning mechanism. We emphasize techniques that classify single-page typeset document images without using OCR results. Developing a general, adaptable, high-performance classifier is challenging due to the great variety of documents, the diverse criteria used to define document classes, and the ambiguity that arises due to ill-defined or fuzzy document classes."

Existing methods use both local features and global layout information. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the global matching of Component Block Projections (CBP), which are the concatenated directional projection vectors of the component blocks of a document image. Compared to those existing methods, CBP-based template-matching methods possess two major advantages: (1) The spatial relationship among the component blocks of a document image is better represented, hence a very high matching accuracy can be obtained even for a large template set and seriously distorted input images; and (2) the effective matching distance of each template and the triangle inequality are proposed to significantly reduce the computational cost. Our experimental results confirm these advantages and show that the CBP-based template-matching methods are very suitable for DIR applications."

Thistechnology can solve difficulties in variety for readingdifferent items on fairly large number of different types offorms. The form-type identification consists of two parts:(i) extraction of targets such as important keywords in aform by matching between recogised characters and wordstrings in a keyword dictionary, and (ii) analysis ofpositional or semantic relationship between the targets byconstellation matching between these targets and wordlocation information in the keyword dictionary. The formdatarecognition consists of two parts: (i) extraction of aregion of interest (ROI) contained a character string of theitem by using a layout knowledge of the very form-type,and (ii) character string recognition of the item by usingthe linguistic constraint which can be obtained from acontent knowledge of the form-type. A experiment using642 sample forms with 107 different types in totalconfirmed that the form-type identification method cancorrectly identify 97% of 642 form samples at a rejectionrate 3%. Another experiment confirmed that the form-data recognition method can correctly read 95% of thenumber of items on the form samples."

Tokens close by their morphology and confirmed in their location within different similar contexts make apparent some parts of speech representative of the structure elements. This bottom up approach avoids the use of an priori knowledge provided that there are redundant and frequent contexts in the text. The approach is applied on the invoice body text roughly recognized by OCR and automatically segmented. The method makes possible the detection of the invoice articles and their different fields. The regularity of the article composition and its redundancy in the invoice is a good help for its structure. The recognition rate of 276 invoices and 1704 articles, is over than 91.02% for articles and 92.56% for fields."

Two CBR cycles are performed sequentially in CBRDIA. The first one consists in checking whether a similar document has already been processed, which makes the interpretation of the current one easy. The second cycle works if the first one fails. It processes the document by analyzing and interpreting its structuring elements (adresses, amounts, tables, etc) one by one. The CBR cycles allow processing documents from both knonwn or unknown classes. Applied on 923 invoices, CBRDIA reaches a recognition rate of 85,22% for documents of known classes and 74,90% for documents of unknown classes."

Values of invoice metadata are then manually inputted into the system as a link reference. However, this manual process is tedious, costly and prone to cause errors.In this paper, we describe a novel method to automatically identify, extract metadata values and separate each individual invoice copy from the stack. The separated invoice copies are then associated and linked with their corresponding XML invoice data by matching their metadata values using Web services integration. Storage and retrieval of these invoice data and files are managed through Web services in an \"invoice to cash\" multi-tenancy software as a service (SaaS) invoice services management application. This Web application can present XML invoice data along with its corresponding original invoice copy to the customer for review and printing. The service is enhanced with a resolution interface that allows for the manual processing for those invoices that mismatched with the original invoice data or were not recognized by the system. The attachment of the original invoice copy greatly improves invoice clarity, accuracy, reduces the number of disputes and improves customer satisfaction."

The results of a project analyzing this 'treasure' of knowledge and putting it to use in the smartFIX system are presented. The evaluation shows that this transfer of knowledge using state-of-the-art techniques in transfer learning achieves significantly higher initial recognition rates than the unaugmented system, delivering instant economic advantages by reducing accountant personnel workload."
