In previous work the Pictorial Structure Model approach has proven particularly successful, and is appealing because of its moderate computational cost. However, the accuracy of resulting pose estimates has been limited by the use of simple representations of limb appearance. We propose strong discriminatively trained limb detectors combining gradient and color segmentation cues. Our main contribution is a novel method for capturing coherent appearance properties of a limb using efficient color segmentation applied to every limb hypothesis during inference. The approach gives state-of-the-art results improving significantly on the \u201citerative image parsing\u201d method, and shows significant promise for combination with other models of pose and appearance."

A generative model, comprising of the human articulated structure, shape and clothing models, is used to formulate likelihood measures for evaluating solution candidates. We adopt a data-driven proposal mechanism for searching the solution space efficiently. We introduce the use of proposal maps, which is an efficient way of implementing inference proposals derived from multiple types of image cues. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the technique is effective in estimating 3D body pose over a variety of images."

This paper shows that such specialization may not be necessary, and proposes a generic approach based on the pictorial structures framework. We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using belief propagation. We demonstrate that such a model is equally suitable for both detection and pose estimation tasks, outperforming the state of the art on three recently proposed datasets."

While such models allow efficient learning and inference, they fail to capture additional dependencies between body parts, other than kinematic constraints between connected parts. In this paper, we consider the use of multiple tree models, rather than a single tree model for human pose estimation. Our model can alleviate the limitations of a single tree-structured model by combining information provided across different tree models. The parameters of each individual tree model are trained via standard learning algorithms in a single tree-structured model. Different tree models can be combined in a discriminative fashion by a boosting procedure. We present experimental results showing the improvement of our approaches on two different datasets. On the first dataset, we use our multiple tree framework for occlusion reasoning. On the second dataset, we combine multiple deformable trees for capturing spatial constraints between non-connected body parts."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

We show how this seemingly difficult problem can be solved by (i) reducing it to an equivalent convex problem with a small, polynomial number of constraints (taking advantage of the fact that the model is tree-structured and the potentials have a special form); and (ii) obtaining the globally optimal model using an efficient dual decomposition strategy. Each component of the dual decomposition is solved by a modified version of the highly optimized SVM-Light algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we learn human upper body models using two challenging, publicly available datasets. Our model accounts for the articulation of humans as well as the occlusion of parts. We compare our method with a baseline iterative strategy as well as a state of the art algorithm and show significant efficiency improvements."

We seek a model of appearance and motion that is generic in that it accounts for the ways in which people's appearance varies and, at the same time, is specific enough to be useful for tracking people in natural scenes. Given a 3D model of the person projected into an image we model the likelihood of observing various image cues conditioned on the predicted locations and orientations of the limbs. These cues are taken to be steered filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion-compensated temporal differences. Motivated by work on the statistics of natural scenes, the statistics of these filter responses for human limbs are learned from training images containing hand-labeled limb regions. Similarly, the statistics of the filter responses in general scenes are learned to define a \u201cbackground\u201d distribution. The likelihood of observing a scene given a predicted pose of a person is computed, for each limb, using the likelihood ratio between the learned foreground (person) and background distributions. Adopting a Bayesian formulation allows cues to be combined in a principled way. Furthermore, the use of learned distributions obviates the need for hand-tuned image noise models and thresholds. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the statistics of how people appear in scenes and provides a connection between work on natural image statistics and the Bayesian tracking of people."

Unlike traditional kinematic tree representations, our model of the body is a collection of loosely-connected limbs. Conditional probabilities relating the 3D pose of connected limbs are learned from motion-captured training data. Similarly, we learn probabilistic models for the temporal evolution of each limb (forward and backward in time). Human pose and motion estimation is then solved with non-parametric belief propagation using a variation of particle filtering that can be applied over a general loopy graph. The loose-limbed model and decentralized graph structure facilitate the use of low-level visual cues. We adopt simple limb and head detectors to provide \"bottom-up\" information that is incorporated into the inference process at every time-step; these detectors permit automatic initialization and aid recovery from transient tracking failures. We illustrate the method by automatically tracking a walking person in video imagery using four calibrated cameras. Our experimental apparatus includes a marker-based motion capture system aligned with the coordinate frame of the calibrated cameras with which we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our 3D person tracker."

Typically, one fits a model by maximizing the likelihood of the part labels. Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector). Our model is general enough to find other articulated objects; we use it to recover poses of horses in the challenging Weizmann database."

While such models can effectively represent the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure, they do not capture additional constraints such as coordination of the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss an important source of information about human body pose, as limb coordination is necessary for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being evident in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this paper, we consider the use of undirected graphical models that augment a tree structure with latent variables in order to account for coordination between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor models, since they are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional correlations in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree structure. These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure and thus a variant of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can be applied for efficient estimation. We present some experimental results contrasting common-factor models with tree models, and quantify the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data."

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose."

                "text": "Efficient detection of objects in images is complicated by variations of object appearance due to intra-class object differences, articulation, lighting, occlusions, and aspect variations. To reduce the search required for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features, relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation of a face."

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

We cast the problem as inference in a generative model of the image. Under this model, limb detection is expensive due to the very large number of \npossible configurations each part can assume. We make the following contributions to reduce this cost: (i) using efficient sampling from a pictorial structure proposal distribution to obtain reasonable configurations; (ii) identifying a large set of frames where correct configurations can be inferred, and using temporal tracking elsewhere. Results are reported for signing footage with changing background, challenging image conditions, and different signers; and we show that the method is able to identify the true arm and hand locations. The results exceed the state-of-the-art for the length and stability of continuous limb tracking."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

                "text": "This paper describes a visual object detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features and yields extremely efficient classifiers [4]. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection are presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems [16, 11, 14, 10, 1]. Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.

We approximate the decision surface in terms of a reduced set of expansion vectors and propose a cascaded evaluation which has the property that the full support\u2013vector expansion is only evaluated on the face\u2013like parts of the image, while the largest part of typical images is classified using a single expansion vector (a simpler and more efficient classifier). As a result, only three reduced\u2013set vectors are used, on average, to classify an image patch. Hence, the cascaded evaluation, presented in this paper, offers a thirtyfold speed\u2013up over an evaluation using the full set of reduced\u2013set vectors, which is itself already thirty times faster than classification using all the support vectors."

The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."
