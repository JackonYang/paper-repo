The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given.

We use a novel stop word identification method to automatically generate domain specific stoplists which are much larger than a conventional domain-independent stoplist. In our tests with three categorization methods on text collections from different domains/applications, significant numbers of words were removed without sacrificing categorization effectiveness. In the test of the Expert Network method on CACM documents, for example, an 87% removal of unique words reduced the vocabulary of documents from 8,002 distinct words to 1,045 words, which resulted in a 63% time savings and a 74% memory savings in the computation of category ranking, with a 10% precision improvement on average over not using word removal. It is evident in this study that automated word removal based on corpus statistics has a practical and significant impact on the computational tractability of categorization methods in large databases."

Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the \"virtual support vector\" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the \"reduced set\" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1 % error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances. The reduced set method is applicable to any support vector machine."

We consider three classification techniques which have decision rules that are derived via explicit error minimization: linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We demonstrate that the classifiers perform 1015% better than relevance feedback via Rocchio expansion for the TREC-2 and TREC-3 routing tasks. Error minimization is difficult in high-dimensional feature spaces because the convergence process is slow and the models are prone to overfitting. We use two different strategies, latent semantic indexing and optimal term selection, to reduce the number of features. Our results indicate that features based on latent semantic indexing are more effective for techniques such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, which have no way to protect against overfitting. Neural networks perform equally well with either set of features and can take advantage of the additional information available when both feature sets are used as input."

Using an already coded training database of about 50,000 stories from the Dow Jones Press Release News Wire, and SEEKER [Stanfill] (a text retrieval system that supports relevance feedback) as the underlying match engine, codes are assigned to new, unseen stories with a recall of about 80% and precision of about 70%. There are about 350 different codes to be assigned. Using a massively parallel supercomputer, we leverage the information already contained in the thousands of coded stories and are able to code a story in about 2 seconds. Given SEEKER, the text retrieval system, we achieved these results in about two person-months. We believe this approach is effective in reducing the development time to implement classification systems involving large number of topics for the purpose of classification, message routing etc."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors."

These algorithms and variations on them have been the subject of numerous research papers since Quinlan introduced ID3. Until recently, most researchers looking for an introduction to decision trees turned to Quinlan's seminal 1986 Machine Learning journal article [Quinlan, 1986]. In his new book, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Quinlan has put together a definitive, much needed description of his complete system, including the latest developments.

As well as making explicit some of the details on SRM, it provides a result that allows one to trade off errors on the training sample against improved generalization performance. It then considers the more general case when the hierarchy of classes is chosen in response to the data. A result is presented on the generalization performance of classifiers with a \"large margin\". This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms of \"luckiness\" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets. Four examples are given of such functions, including the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (1971) dimension measured on the sample."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

To complement recent work on creating searchable indexes of the World-Wide Web and systems for filtering incoming e-mail and Usenet news articles, we describe a system which helps users keep abreast of new and interesting information. Every day it presents a selection of interesting web pages. The user evaluates each page, and given this feedback the system adapts and attempts to produce better pages the following day. We present some early results from an AI programming class to whom this was set as a project, and then describe our current implementation. Over the course of 24 days the output of our system was compared to both randomly-selected and human-selected pages. It consistently performed better than the random pages, and was better than the human-selected pages half of the time."

They are easy to define if there is a single query and if the retrieval result generated for the query is a linear ordering. However, when the retrieval results are weakly ordered, in the sense that several documents have an identical retrieval status value with respect to a query, some probabilistic notion of precision has to be introduced. Relevance probability, expected precision, and so forth, are some alternatives mentioned in the literature for this purpose. Furthermore, when many queries are to be evaluated and the retrieval results averaged over these queries, some method of interpolation of precision values at certain preselected recall levels is needed. The currently popular approaches for handling both a weak ordering and interpolation are found to be inconsistent, and the results obtained are not easy to interpret. Moreover, in cases where some alternatives are available, no comparative analysis that would facilitate the selection of a particular strategy has been provided. In this paper, we systematically investigate the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance. Our motivation is to provide a comparative analysis of methods available for defining precision in a probabilistic sense and to promote a better understanding of the various issues involved in retrieval performance evaluation."

Neural networks allow us to model higher-order interaction between document terms and to simultaneously predict multiple topics using shared hidden features. In the context of this model, we compare two approaches to dimensionality reduction in representation: one based on term selection and another based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Two diierent methods are proposed for improving LSI representations for the topic spotting task. We nd that term selection and our modiied LSI representations lead to similar topic spotting performance, and that this performance is equal to or better than other published results on the same corpus."

This paper describes a simple but operational tour guide, called WebWatcher, which has given over 5000 tours to people browsing CMU's School of Computer Science Web pages. WebWatcher accompanies users from page to page, suggests appropriate hyperlinks, and learns from experience to improve its advice-giving skills.

Although the cell nuclei as the primary object of these studies were the same in all the tumors, distinct features were evaluated in each case to determine to what degree the results obtained by these techniques are comparable. From the cytogenetic viewpoint, six tumors had a modal number in the diploid range, seven were in the triploid range, and two in the tetraploid range; seven tumors had no modal number. These data correlate with the flow cytometry and cytophotometry results obtained, with DNA values slightly higher than their respective chromosomal modes. However, no correspondence between chromosomal modes and mean nuclear area was found. Chromosomal markers have been identified that particulary affect chromosomes 1 (p11, q21-qter), 11 and 16, although no common markers existed in all cases. Cytogenetics is the most sensitive technique, but the low yield (22 out of 140 tumors assayed) considerably restricts its value in any prospective breast cancer study."
