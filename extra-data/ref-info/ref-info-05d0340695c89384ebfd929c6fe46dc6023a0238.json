This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

To our knowledge, this is the first model that performs all three tasks in one coherent framework. For instance, a scene of a `polo game' consists of several visual objects such as `human', `horse', `grass', etc. In addition, it can be further annotated with a list of more abstract (e.g. `dusk') or visually less salient (e.g. `saddle') tags. Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes. In all three tasks, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

                "text": "We consider the problem of estimating detailed 3D structure from a single still image of an unstructured environment. Our goal is to create 3D models which are both quantitatively accurate as well as visually pleasing. For each small homogeneous patch in the image, we use a Markov random field (MRF) to infer a set of \"plane parameters\" that capture both the 3D location and 3D orientation of the patch. The MRF, trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the image. Inference in our model is tractable, and requires only solving a convex optimization problem. Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the algorithm to capture much more detailed 3D structure than does prior art (such as Saxena et ah, 2005, Delage et ah, 2005, and Hoiem et el, 2005), and also give a much richer experience in the 3D flythroughs created using image-based rendering, even for scenes with significant non-vertical structure. Using this approach, we have created qualitatively correct 3D models for 64.9% of 588 images downloaded from the Internet, as compared to Hoiem et al.'s performance of 33.1%. Further, our models are quantitatively more accurate than either Saxena et al. or Hoiem et al."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

Exploring all possible pixel subsets is prohibitively expensive, leading to recent approaches which use unsupervised image segmentation to reduce the size of the configuration space. Image segmentation, however, is known to be unstable, strongly affected by small image perturbations, feature choices, or different segmentation algorithms. This instability has led to advocacy for using multiple segmentations of an image. In this paper, we explore the question of how to best integrate the information from multiple bottom-up segmentations of an image to improve object recognition robustness. By integrating the image partition hypotheses in an intuitive combined top-down and bottom-up recognition approach, we improve object and feature support. We further explore possible extensions of our method and whether they provide improved performance. Results are presented on the MSRC 21-class data set and the Pascal VOC2007 object segmentation challenge."

It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results."

The first is the Sowerby dataset, which contains one hundred colour photographs of country roads in England that have been interactively segmented and classified into six classes-edge, vegetation, air, road, building, and other. The second domain is a set of thirty five-images, taken in San Francisco, which have been interactively segmented into similar classes. In each domain we learn the joint probability distributions of filter responses, based on colour and texture, for each class. These distributions are then used for classification. We restrict ourselves to a limited number of filters in order to ensure that the learnt filter responses do not overfit the training data (our region classes are chosen so as to ensure that there is enough data to avoid over fitting). We do performance analysis on the two datasets by evaluating the false positive and false negative error rates for the classification. This shows that the learnt models achieve high accuracy in classifying individual pixels into those classes for which the filter responses are approximately spatially homogeneous (i.e. road, vegetation, and air but not edge and building). A more sensitive performance measure, the Chernoff information, is calculated in order to quantify how well the cues for edge and building are doing. This demonstrates that statistical knowledge of the domain is a powerful tool for segmentation."

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

A promising graph cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs known as \"roof duality\" was recently introduced into computer vision. We study two methods which extend this approach. First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the \"probing\" technique introduced recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach. In comparison to existing techniques, such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and simulated annealing, we nearly always find a lower energy."

However, in order to be computationally tractable they are limited to incorporate only local interactions and cannot model global properties, such as connectedness, which is a potentially useful high-level prior for object segmentation. In this work, we overcome this limitation by deriving a potential function that enforces the output labeling to be connected and that can naturally be used in the framework of recent MAP-MRF LP relaxations. Using techniques from polyhedral combinatorics, we show that a provably tight approximation to the MAP solution of the resulting MRF can still be found efficiently by solving a sequence of max-flow problems. The efficiency of the inference procedure also allows us to learn the parameters of a MRF with global connectivity potentials by means of a cutting plane algorithm. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm on both synthetic data and on the challenging segmentation task of the PASCAL VOC 2008 data set. We show that in both cases the addition of a connectedness prior significantly reduces the segmentation error."

However, as they consider objects as loose collections of local patches they fail to accurately locate object boundaries and are not able to produce accurate object segmentation. On the other hand, Markov random field models used for image segmentation focus on object boundaries but can hardly use the global constraints necessary to deal with object categories whose appearance may vary significantly. In this paper we combine the advantages of both approaches. First, a mechanism based on local regions allows object detection using visual word occurrences and produces a rough image segmentation. Then, a MRF component gives clean boundaries and enforces label consistency, guided by local image cues (color, texture and edge cues) and by long-distance dependencies. Gibbs sampling is used to infer the model. The proposed method successfully segments object categories with highly varying appearances in the presence of cluttered backgrounds and large view point changes. We show that it outperforms published results on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset."

We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations. We demonstrate that such an algorithm succeeds in automatically discovering many familiar objects in a variety of image datasets, including those from Caltech, MSRC and LabelMe."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

In particular, graph cut has problems with segmenting thin elongated objects due to the ldquoshrinking biasrdquo. To overcome this problem, we propose to impose an additional connectivity prior, which is a very natural assumption about objects. We formulate several versions of the connectivity constraint and show that the corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard. For some of these versions we propose two optimization algorithms: (i) a practical heuristic technique which we call DijkstraGC, and (ii) a slow method based on problem decomposition which provides a lower bound on the problem. We use the second technique to verify that for some practical examples DijkstraGC is able to find the global minimum."

Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field."

In this work, we build on the tree reweighted message passing (TRW) framework of (Kolmogorov, 2006; Wainwright et al., 2005). TRW iteratively optimizes the Lagrangian dual of a linear programming relaxation for MAP estimation. We show how the dual formulation of TRW can be extended to include cycle inequalities (Barahona & Mahjoub, 1986) and some recently proposed second order cone (SOC) constraints (Kumar et al., 2007). We propose efficient iterative algorithms for solving the resulting duals. Similar to the method described in (Kolmogorov, 2006), these algorithms are guaranteed to converge. We test our approach on a large set of synthetic data, as well as real data. Our experiments show that the additional constraints (i.e. cycle inequalities and SOC constraints) provide better results in cases where the TRW framework fails (namely MAP estimation for non-submodular energy functions)."

ACM, 49 (2002), pp. 616--630] and captures many classification problems that arise in computer vision and related fields. They gave an O(log k log log k) approximation for the general case, where k is the number of labels, and a 2-approximation for the uniform metric case. (In fact, the bound for general metrics can be improved to O(log k) by the work of Fakcheroenphol, Rao, and Talwar [Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2003, pp. 448--455].) Subsequently, Gupta and Tardos [Proceedings of the 32nd Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, 2000, pp. 652--658] gave a 4-approximation for the truncated linear metric, a metric motivated by practical applications to image restoration and visual correspondence. In this paper we introduce an integer programming formulation and show that the integrality gap of its linear relaxation either matches or improves the ratios known for several cases of the metric labeling problem studied until now, providing a unified approach to solving them. In particular, we show that the integrality gap of our linear programming (LP) formulation is bounded by O(log k) for a general k-point metric and 2 for the uniform metric, thus matching the known ratios. We also develop an algorithm based on our LP formulation that achieves a ratio of $2+\\sqrt{2}\\simeq 3.414$ for the truncated linear metric improving the earlier known ratio of 4. Our algorithm uses the fact that the integrality gap of the LP formulation is 1 on a linear metric."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

These relaxations can be solved efficiently using message-passing algorithms such as belief propagation and, when the relaxation is tight, provably find the MAP configuration. The standard LP relaxation is not tight enough in many real-world problems, however, and this has lead to the use of higher order cluster-based LP relaxations. The computational cost increases exponentially with the size of the clusters and limits the number and type of clusters we can use. We propose to solve the cluster selection problem monotonically in the dual LP, iteratively selecting clusters with guaranteed improvement, and quickly re-solving with the added clusters by reusing the existing solution. Our dual message-passing algorithm finds the MAP configuration in protein side-chain placement, protein design, and stereo problems, in cases where the standard LP relaxation fails."

The resulting optimization problem is solved efficiently by a cutting plane algorithm that exploits the sparseness and structural decomposition of the problem.

It does so by relying on a much tighter class of LP-relaxations, called cycle-relaxations. With the help of this class of relaxations, our algorithm tries to deal with a difficulty lying at the heart of MRF optimization: the existence of inconsistent cycles. To this end, it uses an operation called cycle-repairing. The goal of that operation is to fix any inconsistent cycles that may appear during optimization, instead of simply ignoring them as usually done up to now. The more the repaired cycles, the tighter the underlying LP relaxation becomes. As a result of this procedure, our algorithm is capable of providing almost optimal solutions even for very general MRFs with arbitrary potentials. Experimental results verify its effectiveness on difficult MRF problems, as well as its better performance compared to the state of the art."

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples on the shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVM light is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks.

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
