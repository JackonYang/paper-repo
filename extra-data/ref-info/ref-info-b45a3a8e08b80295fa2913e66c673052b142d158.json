In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular handcrafted alternatives. Extensive experiments show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories."

One of the main requirement of deep CNN architecture is that they need huge number of samples for training. To overcome this problem we adopt a deep CNN which is trained using big image dataset containing millions of samples i.e., ImageNet. The proposed work outperforms both the traditional structure similarity methods and the CNN based approaches proposed earlier. The accuracy of the proposed approach with merely 20 images per class outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving classification accuracy of 68.25%. The best results on Tobbacoo-3428 dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a significant margin and achieved a median accuracy of 77.6% with 100 samples per class used for training and validation."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

The layout is described by means of a hierarchical description, the modified X-Y tree, that is derived from the classical X-Y tree segmentation algorithm taking into account cuts along lines in addition to cuts along white spaces between blocks. In order to reduce problems due to noise and the skew of the input image, the modified X-Y tree is built on top of regions extracted by a commercial OCR package. The tree is afterwards coded into a fixed-size representation that takes into account occurrences of tree patterns in the tree representing the page. Lastly, this feature vector is fed to an artificial neural network that is trained to classify document images. The system is applied to the classification of documents belonging to digital libraries. Examples of classes taken into account are \"title page\", \"index\" and \"regular page\". Many tests have been carried out on a data set of more than 600 pages from an online digital library. These tests allowed us to conclude that the use of modified X-Y trees is advantageous with respect to the classical X-Y decomposition for this classification task."

However, such large datasets are not always available or affordable in many applications areas where we would like to apply DCNs, having only datasets of the order of a few thousands labelled images, acquired and annotated through lenghty and costly processes (such as in plant recognition, medical imaging, etc.). In such cases DCNs do not generally show competitive performance and one must resort to fine-tune networks that were costly pretrained with large generic datasets where there is no a-priori guarantee that they would work well in specialized domains. In this work we propose to train DCNs with a greedy layer-wise method, analogous to that used in unsupervised deep networks. We show how, for small datasets, this method outperforms DCNs which do not use pretrained models and results reported in the literature with other methods. Additionally, our method learns more interpretable and cleaner visual features. Our results are also competitive as compared with convolutional methods based on pretrained models when applied to general purpose datasets, and we obtain them with much smaller datasets (1.2 million vs. 10K images) at a fraction of the computational cost. We therefore consider this work a first milestone in our quest to successfully use DCNs for small specialized datasets."

There is great diversity in document image classifiers: they differ in the problems they solve, in the use of training data to construct class models, and in the choice of document features and classification algorithms. We survey this diverse literature using three components: the problem statement, the classifier architecture, and performance evaluation. This brings to light important issues in designing a document classifier, including the definition of document classes, the choice of document features and feature representation, and the choice of classification algorithm and learning mechanism. We emphasize techniques that classify single-page typeset document images without using OCR results. Developing a general, adaptable, high-performance classifier is challenging due to the great variety of documents, the diverse criteria used to define document classes, and the ambiguity that arises due to ill-defined or fuzzy document classes."

The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify it by type in the absence of domain-specific models. Our approach to classification is based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of layout structure and is implemented by building a supervised classifier, given examples of each class. We use image features such as percentages of text and non-text (graphics, images, tables, and rulings) content regions, column structures, relative point sizes of fonts, density of content area, and statistics of features of connected components which can be derived without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a study where subjects ranked document pages with respect to their resemblance to representative page images. Class labels can also be assigned based on known document types, or can be defined by the user. We implemented our classification scheme using decision tree classifiers and self-organizing maps."

In this paper, the problem is formulated in the framework of concept learning and each category corresponds to the set of image documents with similar physical structure. We propose a solution based on two algorithmic ideas. First, we obtain a structured representation of images based on labeled XY-trees (this representation informs the learner about important relationships between image subconstituents). Second, we propose a probabilistic architecture that extends hidden Markov models for learning probability distributions defined on spaces of labeled trees. Finally, a successful application of this method to the categorization of commercial invoices is presented."

The methods are useful for visual similarity based document retrieval as well as fast algorithms for initial document type classification without OCR. A novel feature set called interval encoding is introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors by capturing structural characteristics of the image. These fixed-length vectors are then compared to each other through a Manhattan distance computation for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their layout similarity to a test document. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the features derived from interval coding in a hidden Markov model based page layout classification system that is trainable and extendible. The methods described in the paper can be used in various document retrieval tasks including visual similarity based retrieval, categorization and information extraction."

Instead of top-down determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood). The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations from a neighborhood. Consequently, heuristics are learned for structurally discriminating documents during subsequent classification.<<ETX>>"
