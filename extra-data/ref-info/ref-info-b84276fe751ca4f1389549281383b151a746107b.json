A majority of the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules. \nIn this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules. \nIn experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%."

                "text": "A CORPUS-BASED APPROACH TO LANGUAGE LEARNING Eric Brill Supervisor: Mitchell Marcus One goal of computational linguistics is to discover a method for assigning a rich structural annotation to sentences that are presented as simple linear strings of words; meaning can be much more readily extracted from a structurally annotated sentence than from a sentence with no structural information. Also, structure allows for a more in-depth check of the well-formedness of a sentence. There are two phases to assigning these structural annotations: rst, a knowledge base is created and second, an algorithm is used to generate a structural annotation for a sentence based upon the facts provided in the knowledge base. Until recently, most knowledge bases were created manually by language experts. These knowledge bases are expensive to create and have not been used e ectively in structurally parsing sentences from other than highly restricted domains. The goal of this dissertation is to make signi cant progress toward designing automata that are able to learn some structural aspects of human language with little human guidance. In particular, we describe a learning algorithm that takes a small structurally annotated corpus of text and a larger unannotated corpus as input, and automatically learns how to assign accurate structural descriptions to sentences not in the training corpus. The main tool we use to automatically discover structural information about language from corpora is transformation-based error-driven learning. The distribution of errors produced by an imperfect annotator is examined to learn an ordered list of transformations that can be applied to provide an accurate structural annotation. We demonstrate the application of this learning algorithm iv to part of speech tagging and parsing. Successfully applying this technique to create systems that learn could lead to robust, trainable and accurate natural language processing systems. v"

TINA integrates key ideas from context free grammars, Augmented Transition Networks (ATN's), and the unification concept. TINA provides a seamless interface between syntactic and semantic analysis, and also produces a highly constraining probabilistic language model to improve recognition performance. An initial set of context-free rewrite rules provided by hand is first converted to a network structure. Probability assignments on all arcs in the network are obtained automatically from a set of example sentences. The parser uses a stack decoding search strategy, with a top-down control flow, and includes a feature-passing mechanism to deal with long-distance movement, agreement, and semantic constraints. TINA provides an automatic sentence generation capability that has been effective for identifying overgeneralization problems as well as in producing a word-pair language model for a recognizer. The parser is currently integrated with MIT's SUMMIT recognizer for use in two application domains, with the parser screening recognizer outputs either at the sentential level or to filter partial theories during the active search process."

The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser with Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory in the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the context of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from previous attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional probabilities based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also provides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in part-of-speech assignment, unknown word models, and other probabilistic models of linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving these techniques instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In tests performed on the Voyager direction-finding domain, Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting correct parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar."

HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error."

As a consequence, one parse tree can usually be generated by several derivations that involve different subtrees. This leads to a statistics where the probability of a parse is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all its derivations. In (Scha, 1990) an informal introduction to DOP is given, while (Bod, 1992a) provides a formalization of the theory. In this paper we compare DOP with other stochastic grammars in the context of Formal Language Theory. It it proved that it is not possible to create for every DOP-model a strongly equivalent stochastic CFG which also assigns the same probabilities to the parses. We show that the maximum probability parse can be estimated in polynomial time by applying Monte Carlo techniques. The model was tested on a set of hand-parsed strings from the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) spoken language corpus. Preliminary experiments yield 96% test set parsing accuracy."

This probabilistic language model extends trigrams by allowing a word to be predicted not only from the two immediately preceeding words, but potentially from any preceeding pair of adjacent words that lie within the same sentence. In this way, the trigram model can skip over less informative words to make its predictions. The underlying \"grammar\" is nothing more than a list of pairs of words that can be linked together with one or more intervening words; this word-pair grammar is automatically inferred from a corpus of training text. We present a novel technique for indexing the model parameters that allows us to avoid all sorting in the M-step of the training algorithm. This results in significant savings in computation time, and is applicable to the training of a general probabilistic link grammar. Results of preliminary experiments carried out for this class of models are presented."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."

The main novelty of these experiments is the use of untagged text in the training of the model. We have used a simple triclass Markov model and are looking for the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data provided. Two approaches in particular are compared and combined:using text that has been tagged by hand and computing relative frequency counts,using text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.Experminents show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible. They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy. In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available."

                "text": "Selectional constraints are limitations on the applicability of predicates to arguments. For example, the statement \"The number two is blue\" may be syntactically well formed, but at some level it is anomalous-- scBLUE is not a predicate that can be applied to numbers. \nIn this dissertation, I propose a new, information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. Unlike previous approaches, this proposal requires neither the identification of primitive semantic features nor the formalization of complex inferences based on world knowledge. The proposed model assumes instead that lexical items are organized in a conceptual taxonomy according to class membership, where classes are defined simply as sets--that is, extensionally, rather than in terms of explicit features or properties. Selection is formalized in terms of a probabilistic relationship between predicates and concepts: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments, expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy. The use of relative entropy leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate's selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. \nIn addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (\"John ate $\\emptyset$\") and others do not (\"*John brought $\\emptyset$\"). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between inferability and selectional constraints, and have confirmed the connection between selectional constraints and implicit objects in a set of computational experiments. \nSecond, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that often lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships such as selectional preference and concept similarity. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing."

The algorithm exploits both local syntactic patterns and more distant collocational evidence, generating an efficient, effective, and highly perspicuous recipe for resolving a given ambiguity. By identifying and utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies. Although directly applicable to a wide class of ambiguities, the algorithm is described and evaluated in a realistic case study, the problem of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French text. Current accuracy exceeds 99% on the full task, and typically is over 90% for even the most difficult ambiguities."

If appropriate care is taken, we find that it is possible to make useful estimates of contextual probabilities that improve performance in a spelling correction application. In contrast, less careful estimates are found to be useless. Specifically, we will show that the Good-Turing method makes the use of contextual information practical for a spelling corrector, while attempts to use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or expected likelihood estimator (ELE) fail. Spelling correction was selected as an application domain because it is analogous to many important recognition applications based on a noisy channel model (such as speech recognition), though somewhat simpler and therefore possibly more amenable to detailed statistical analysis."

Thus, for example, it is hard for most parsers to take advantage of the fact that wine is typically drunk, produced, and sold, but (probably) not pruned. So too, it is hard for a parser to know which verbs go with which prepositions (e.g., set up) and which nouns fit together to form compound noun phrases (e.g., computer programmer). This paper will attempt to show that many of these types of concerns can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not require explicit semantic interpretation. We have found that it is possible to identify many of these interesting co-occurrence relations by computing simple summary statistics over millions of words of text. This paper will summarize a number of experiments carried out by various subsets of the authors over the last few years. The term collocation will be used quite broadly to include constraints on SVO (subject verb object) triples, phrasal verbs, compound noun phrases, and psycholinguistic notions of word association (e.g., doctorinurse)."
