                "text": "We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

The questions are grouped into highly structured inquiries in the form of a tree. There are, in fact, many trees, each constructed from training data based on entropy reduction. The outcome of each tree is not a classification but rather a distribution over shape classes. The final classification is based on an aggregate distribution. The framework is non-Euclidean and there is no feature vector in the standard sense. Instead, the representation of the image data is graphical and each question is associated with a labeled subgraph. The ordering of the questions is highly constrained in order to maintain computational feasibility, and dependence among the trees is reduced by randomly sub-sampling from the available pool of questions. Experiments are reported on the recognition of handwritten digits. Although the amount of training data is modest by today's standards, the rates we achieve are competitive with those reported elsewhere using neural network, nearest-neighbor and other nonparametric classifiers.

Conjunctions of local properties are consistent and unique for distinct shapes and are robust enough to represent shape in the presence of occlusion. A new learning method, called property based learning, is developed and used to learn conjunctions of local properties. Unlike other classification methods based on distances or similarities, classification performance does not degrade linearly as the number of classes increases and classification can be done correctly with only partial information of instances. Property based learning is an incremental learning method that selects properties crucial for classification. Two experiments are reported. In the first experiment with tool shapes, this shape learning system is used to classify shapes in the presence of view point changes, local movements such as moving handles of pliers, and occlusion. In the second experiment with hand gestures, the system can classify different gestures regardless of the movement in joints, fingers, and palms. >"

It is also shown that the performance of these systems scale consistently with the size of the training database, where the error rate is cut by more than half for every tenfold increase in the size of the training set from 10 to 100,000 examples. Three distance metrics for the standard nearest neighbor classification system are investigated: a simple Hamming distance metric, a pixel distance metric, and a metric based on the extraction of penstroke features. Systems employing these metrics were trained and tested on a standard, publicly available, database of nearly 225,000 digits provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Additionally, a confidence metric is both introduced by the authors and also discovered and optimized by the system. The new confidence measure proves to be superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor distance. >"

More complex better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc. We propose a new distance measure which: 1) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input; and 2) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the US Post Office and NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, skewing and line thickness, the method outperformed all other systems on a small (less than 10,000 patterns) database and was competitive on our largest (60,000 patterns) database."

In this paper we describe a penalized version of LDA. It is designed for situations in which there are many highly correlated predictors, such as those obtained by discretizing a function, or the grey-scale values of the pixels in a series of images. In cases such as these it is natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the coefficients, both for improved prediction performance and interpretability. We cast the classification problem into a regression framework via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal facilitates the use of any penalized regression technique in the classification setting. The technique is illustrated with examples in speech recognition and handwritten character recognition."

This is because group decisions are generally better than any individual's. Based on this concept, a method called the \"Behavior-Knowledge Space Method\" was developed, which can aggregate the decisions obtained from individual classifiers and derive the best final decisions from the statistical point of view. Experiments on 46451 samples of unconstrained handwritten numerals have shown that this method achieves very promising performances and outperforms voting, Bayesian, and Dempster-Shafer approaches. >"

Three methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count, and logistic regression are proposed for class set reranking. These methods have been tested in applications of degraded machine-printed characters and works from large lexicons, resulting in substantial improvement in overall correctness. >"

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form (xi, f(xi)). Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that--like the other methods--the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."

When the number of pattern classes is very large, the theorems can reveal both the advantages of a tree classifier and the main difficulties in its implementation. Suppose H is Shannon's entropy measure of the given problem. The theoretical results indicate that the tree searching time can be minimized to the order O(H), but the error rate is also in the same order O(H) due to error accumulation. However, the memory requirement is in the order 0(H exp(H)) which poses serious problems in the implementation of a tree classifier for a large number of classes. To solve these problems, several theorems related to the bounds on the search time, error rate, memory requirement and overlap factor in the design of a decision tree have been proposed and some principles have been established to analyze the behaviors of the decision tree. When applied to classify sets of 64, 450, and 3200 Chinese characters, respectively, the experimental results support the theoretical predictions. For 3200 classes, a very high recognition rate of 99.88 percent was achieved at a high speed of 873 samples/s when the experiment was conducted on a Cyber 172 computer using a high-level language."

The effect of boosting is reported on four handwritten image databases consisting of 12000 digits from segmented ZIP Codes from the United States Postal Service and the following from the National Institute of Standards and Technology: 220000 digits, 45000 upper case letters, and 45000 lower case letters. We use two performance measures: the raw error rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required to achieve a 1% error rate on the patterns not rejected. Boosting improved performance significantly, and, in some cases, dramatically."
