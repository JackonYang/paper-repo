In contrast to the well-known backoff n-gram language models, the neural network approach tries to limit the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space, allowing by this means smooth interpolations. The complexity to train such a model and to calculate one n-gram probability is however several orders of magnitude higher than for the backoff models, making the new approach difficult to use in real applications. In this paper several techniques are presented that allow the use of a neural network language model in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, in particular very, fast lattice rescoring and efficient training of large neural networks on training corpora of over 10 million words. The described approach achieves significant word error reductions with respect to a carefully tuned 4-gram backoff language model in a state of the art conversational speech recognizer for the DARPA rich transcriptions evaluations."

In contrast to the well known backoff ngram language models (LM), the neural network approach tries to limit problems from the data sparseness by performing the estimation in a continuous space, allowing by these means smooth interpolations. Therefore this type of LM is interesting for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available, such as the modeling of conversational speech. In this paper we analyze the generalization behavior of the neural network LM for in-domain training corpora varying from 7M to over 21M words. In all cases, significant word error reductions were observed compared to a carefully tuned 4-gram backoff language model in a state of the art conversational speech recognizer for the NIST rich transcription evaluations. We also apply ensemble learning methods and discuss their connections with LM interpolation."

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

However, it faces the data sparseness problem because of the large dimensionality and diversity of the information available in the syntactic parsing. Previously, we proposed using neural network models for the SLM (Emami, A. et al., Proc. ICASSP, 2003; Emami, Proc. EUROSPEECH'03., 2003). The neural network model is better suited to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. We present a new method of training the neural net based SLM. This procedure makes use of the partial parsing hypothesized by the SLM itself, and is more expensive than the approximate training method used previously. Experiments with the new training method on the UPenn and WSJ corpora show significant reductions in perplexity and word error rate, achieving the lowest published results for the given corpora."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

The goal in this work is to develop a new language modeling approach based on randomly grown Decision Trees (DTs) and apply it to automatic speech recognition. We study our RF approach in the context of -gram type language modeling. Unlike regular -gram language models, RF language models have the potential to generalize well to unseen data, even when a complicated history is used. We show that our RF language models are superior to regular -gram language models in reducing both the perplexity (PPL) and word error rate (WER) in a large vocabulary speech recognition system."

The random class-based model can compensate for some of the shortcomings of conventional class-based models by combining the different solutions obtained through random clusterings.

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

We then describe the bunch-mode back-propagation algorithm and how it can use the PHiPAC derived matrix multiply routines. Using a set of plots, we investigate the tradeoffs between bunch size, convergence rate, and training speed using a standard speech recognition data set and show how use of the PHiPAC routines can lead to a significantly faster back-propagation learning algorithm."

The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire and represents an improvement over his results, The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiant\u2032s polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances."
