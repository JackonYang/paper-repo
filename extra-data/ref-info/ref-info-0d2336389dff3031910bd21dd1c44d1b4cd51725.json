Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this di cult learning problem. Answering these questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization, the positive e ect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a regularizer. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples."

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms."

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difficult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classifier. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We find that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We find that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of \"deep\" vs. \"shallower\" representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved.

Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work."

While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Specifically, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge filters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive fields. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the first layer responses in the data. Specifically, it picks up both colinear (\"contour\") features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex \"corner\" features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu's study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features."

However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by \u2018training them discriminatively\u2019, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a \u2018discriminatively trained\u2019 generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of \u2018discriminative training\u2019, this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that, when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative."

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.

However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting."

We first learn a deep generative model of the unlabeled data using the fast, greedy algorithm introduced by [7]. If the data is high-dimensional and highly-structured, a Gaussian kernel applied to the top layer of features in the DBN works much better than a similar kernel applied to the raw input. Performance at both regression and classification can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively fine-tune the covariance kernel."

Our discussion covers supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very specific prior domain knowledge."

Most traditional methods, such as maximum likelihood and prediction error identification are based on these principles.

The reason is that \u2018stopped minimization\u2019 (where the iterations have been terminated before the absolute minimum has been reached) has more or less identical properties as using regularization (adding a parametric penalty term). Regularization is known to have beneficial effects on the variance of the parameter estimates and it reduces the \u2018variance contribution\u2019 of the misfit. This also explains the concept of \u2018overtraining\u2019 in neural nets. How does one know when to terminate the iterations then? A useful criterion would be to stop iterations when the criterion function applied to a validation data set no longer decreases. However, in this paper, we show th..."

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces \"stroke detectors\" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps."

The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance."

These PGMMs are generative models defined over attributed features and are used to detect and classify objects in natural images. PGMMs are designed so that they can perform rapid inference, parameter learning, and the more difficult task of structure induction. PGMMs can deal with unknown 2D pose (position, orientation, and scale) in both inference and learning, different appearances, or aspects, of the model. The PGMMs can be learnt in an unsupervised manner where the image can contain one of an unknown number of objects of different categories or even be pure background. We first study the weakly supervised case, where each image contains an example of the (single) object of interest, and then generalize to less supervised cases. The goal of this paper is theoretical but, to provide proof of concept, we demonstrate results from this approach on a subset of the Caltech dataset (learning on a training set and evaluating on a testing set). Our results are generally comparable with the current state of the art, and our inference is performed in less than five seconds."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images."

In this context, machine learning algorithms that scale poorly could simply become irrelevant. We need learning algorithms that scale linearly with the volume of the data while maintaining enough statistical efficiency to outperform algorithms that simply process a random subset of the data. This volume offers researchers and engineers practical solutions for learning from large scale datasets, with detailed descriptions of algorithms and experiments carried out on realistically large datasets. At the same time it offers researchers information that can address the relative lack of theoretical grounding for many useful algorithms. After a detailed description of state-of-the-art support vector machine technology, an introduction of the essential concepts discussed in the volume, and a comparison of primal and dual optimization techniques, the book progresses from well-understood techniques to more novel and controversial approaches. Many contributors have made their code and data available online for further experimentation. Topics covered include fast implementations of known algorithms, approximations that are amenable to theoretical guarantees, and algorithms that perform well in practice but are difficult to analyze theoretically.ContributorsLeon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Stephane Canu, Eric Cosatto, Olivier Chapelle, Ronan Collobert, Dennis DeCoste, Ramani Duraiswami, Igor Durdanovic, Hans-Peter Graf, Arthur Gretton, Patrick Haffner, Stefanie Jegelka, Stephan Kanthak, S.

We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncationrunning only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the contrastive divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked autoassociators. The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs and requires only convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps k and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-k is a good descent direction even for small k."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day."

In the standard depiction of the network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics. I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task of filling in missing information, the network develops a continuous attractor that models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical view-point, the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised learning in terms of regression rather than density estimation."

We present efficient learning and inference procedures for this class of models and demonstrate that RBM's can be successfully applied to the Netflix data set, containing over 100 million user/movie ratings. We also show that RBM's slightly outperform carefully-tuned SVD models. When the predictions of multiple RBM models and multiple SVD models are linearly combined, we achieve an error rate that is well over 6% better than the score of Netflix's own system."

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets."

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

We also discuss I-smoothing which is a novel technique for smoothing discriminative training criteria using statistics for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Experiments have been performed on the Switchboard/Call Home corpora of telephone conversations with up to 265 hours of training data. It is shown that for the maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE) criterion, I-smoothing reduces the word error rate (WER) by 0.4% absolute over the MMIE baseline. The combination of MPE and I-smoothing gives an improvement of 1 % over MMIE and a total reduction in WER of 4.8% absolute over the original MLE system."

This paper attempts to show that for recognizing simple objects with high shape variability such as handwritten characters, it is possible, and even advantageous, to feed the system directly with minimally processed images and to rely on learning to extract the right set of features. Convolutional Neural Networks are shown to be particularly well suited to this task. We also show that these networks can be used to recognize multiple objects without requiring explicit segmentation of the objects from their surrounding. The second part of the paper presents the Graph Transformer Network model which extends the applicability of gradient-based learning to systems that use graphs to represents features, objects, and their combinations."

The analysis treats general realizable stochastic neural networks, trained with Kullback-Leibler divergence in the asymptotic case of a large number of training examples. It is shown that the asymptotic gain in the generalization error is small if we perform early stopping, even if we have access to the optimal stopping time. Based on the cross-validation stopping we consider the ratio the examples should be divided into training and cross-validation sets in order to obtain the optimum performance. Although cross-validated early stopping is useless in the asymptotic region, it surely decreases the generalization error in the nonasymptotic region. Our large scale simulations done on a CM5 are in good agreement with our analytical findings."

                "text": "Realistic facial expression animation requires a powerful \u201canimator\u201d (or graphics program) that can represent the kinds of variations in facial appearance that are both possible and likely to occur in a given context. If the goal is fully determined as in character animation for film, knowledge can be provided in the form of human higher-level descriptions. However, for generating facial expressions for interactive interfaces, such as animated avatars, correct expressions for a given context must be generated on the fly. A simple solution is to rely on a set of prototypical expressions or basis shapes that are linearly combined to create every facial expression in an animated sequence (Kleiser, 1989; Parke, 1972). An innovative algorithm for fitting basis shapes to images was proposed by Blanz and Vetter (1999). The main problem with the basis shape approach is that the full range of appearance variation required for convincing expressive behavior is far beyond the capacity of what a small set of basis shapes can accommodate. Moreover, even if many expression components are used to create a repertoire of basis shapes (Joshi et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2000), the interface may need to render different identities or mixtures of facial expressions not captured by the learned basis shapes. A representation of facial appearance for animation must be powerful enough to capture the right constraints for realistic expression generation yet flexible enough to accommodate different identities and behaviors. Besides the obvious utility of such a representation to animated facial interfaces, a good model of facial expression generation would be useful for computer vision tasks because the model\u2019s representation would likely be much richer and more informative than the original pixel data. For example, inferring the model\u2019s representation corresponding to a given image might even allow transferring an expression extracted from an image of a face onto a different character as illustrated by the method of expression cloning (Noh & Neumann, 2001). In this chapter we introduce a novel approach to learning to generate facial expressions that uses a deep belief net (Hinton et al., 2006). The model can easily accommodate different constraints on generation. We demonstrate this by restricting it to generate expressions with a given identity and with elementary facial expressions such as \u201craised eyebrows.\u201d The deep"

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords."

                        "text": ", 2006), reviewed a nd discussed by Bengio and LeCun (2007), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicate d functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in vision, language, and other AI-leve l tasks), one may need deep architectures . The recent surge in experimental work in the field seems to sup port this notion, accumulating evidence that in challenging AI-related tasks\u2014such as compute r vision (Bengio et al., 2007; Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Ranzato et al., 2008; L ee et al., 2009; Mobahi et al., 2009; Osindero and Hinton, 2008), natural language processing (NLP) ( Collobert and Weston, 2008; Weston et al., 2008), robotics (Hadsell et al., 2008), or informati on retrieval (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007; Salakhutdinov et al., 2007)\u2014deep learning methods si gnificantly out-perform comparable but shallow competitors, and often match or beat the state-o f- he-art. These recent demonstrations of the potential of deep learni ng algorithms were achieved despite the serious challenge of training models with many layers of adaptive parameters. In virtually all instances of deep learning, the objective function is a high ly non-convex function of the parameters, with the potential for many distinct local minima in the model parameter space. The principal difficulty is that not all of these minima provide equivalent generalization errors and, we suggest, that for deep architectures, the standard training schemes (based on random initialization) tend to place the parameters in regions of the parameters space that generalize poorly\u2014as was frequently observed empirically but rarely reported (Bengio and LeCun , 2007). The breakthrough to effective training strategies for deep architectures came in 2006 with the algorithms for training deep belief networks (DBN) (Hin to et al., 2006) and stacked autoencoders (Ranzato et al., 2007; Bengio et al., 2007), which a re all based on a similar approach: greedy layer-wise unsupervised pre-training followed by s upervised fine-tuning. Each layer is pretrained with an unsupervised learning algorithm, learning a nonlinear transformation of its input (the output of the previous layer) that captures the main var iations in its input. This unsupervised pre-training sets the stage for a final training phase where t he deep architecture is fine-tuned with respect to a supervised training criterion with gradient-b ased optimization. While the improvement in performance of trained deep models offered by the pre-tra ining strategy is impressive, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying this success. The objective of this paper is to explore, through extensive experimentation, how unsupervised pre-training works to render learning deep architectures m ore effective and why they appear to work so much better than traditional neural network trainin g methods. There are a few reasonable hypotheses why unsupervised pre-training might work. One p ossibility is that unsupervised pretraining acts as a kind of network pre-conditioner, putting the parameter values in the appropriate range for further supervised training. Another possibilit y, suggested by Bengio et al. (2007), is that unsupervised pre-training initializes the model to a point in parameter space that somehow renders the optimization process more effective, in the sense of ach ieving a lower minimum of the empirical cost function."
