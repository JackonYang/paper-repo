This transformation aims at separating the problems of learning the linear and nonlinear parts of the whole input-output mapping, which has many benefits. We study the theoretical properties of the transformation by noting that they make the Fisher information matrix closer to a diagonal matrix, and thus standard gradient closer to the natural gradient. We experimentally confirm the usefulness of the transformations by noting that they make basic stochastic gradient learning competitive with state-of-the-art learning algorithms in speed, and that they seem also to help find solutions that generalize better. The experiments include both classification of small images and learning a lowdimensional representation for images by using a deep unsupervised auto-encoder network. The transformations were beneficial in all cases, with and without regularization and with networks from two to five hidden layers."

Here we generalize this notion to all factors involved in the network''s gradient, leading us to propose centering the slope of hidden unit activation functions as well. Slope centering removes the linear component of backpropagated error; this improves credit assignment in networks with shortcut connections. Benchmark results show that this can speed up learning significantly without adversely affecting the trained network''s generalization ability."

This paper describes further research on the learning procedure. We start by describing the units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative nets. We then give an example in which a network learns a set of filters that enable it to discriminate formant-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning is strongly dependent on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in weight space . We give examples of the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. We give some preliminary results on scaling and show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. Additional results illustrate the effects on learning speed of the amount of interaction between the weights. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our iterative networks and the analog networks described by Hopefield and Tank (Hopfield 85). The learning procedure can discover appropriate weights in their kind of network, as well as determine an optimal schedule for varying the nonlinearity of the units during a search."

                "text": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a \u201cbetter\u201d basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact)."

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms."

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer \u201cpre-training\u201d phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn good generative models and perform well on handwritten digit and visual object recognition tasks."

It follows that statistical theory can provide considerable insight into the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of different network learning methods. We review concepts and analytical results from the literatures of mathematical statistics, econometrics, systems identification, and optimization theory relevant to the analysis of learning in artificial neural networks. Because of the considerable variety of available learning procedures and necessary limitations of space, we cannot provide a comprehensive treatment. Our focus is primarily on learning procedures for feedforward networks. However, many of the concepts and issues arising in this framework are also quite broadly relevant to other network learning paradigms. In addition to providing useful insights, the material reviewed here suggests some potentially useful new training methods for artificial neural networks."

We suggest that their performance may be improved by utilizing the structural information instead of discarding it, and introduce a framework for \"tempering\" each weight accordingly. \n \nIn the tempering model, activation and error signals are treated as approximately independent random variables. The characteristic scale of weight changes is then matched to that of the residuals, allowing structural properties such as a node's fan-in and fan-out to affect the local learning rate and backpropagated error. The model also permits calculation of an upper bound on the global learning rate for batch updates, which in turn leads to different update rules for bias vs. non-bias weights. \n \nThis approach yields hitherto unparalleled performance on the family relations benchmark, a deep multi-layer network: for both batch learning with momentum and the delta-bar-delta algorithm, convergence at the optimal learning rate is sped up by more than an order of magnitude."

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69% on the standard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining."

Unfortunately, in many applications, the number of iterations required before convergence can be large. Modifications to the back-propagation algorithm described by Rumelhart et al. (1986) can greatly accelerate convergence. The modifications consist of three changes:1) instead of updating the network weights after each pattern is presented to the network, the network is updated only after the entire repertoire of patterns to be learned has been presented to the network, at which time the algebraic sums of all the weight changes are applied:2) instead of keeping \u03b7, the \u201clearning rate\u201d (i.e., the multiplier on the step size) constant, it is varied dynamically so that the algorithm utilizes a near-optimum \u03b7, as determined by the local optimization topography; and3) the momentum factor \u03b1 is set to zero when, as signified by a failure of a step to reduce the total error, the information inherent in prior steps is more likely to be misleading than beneficial. Only after the network takes a useful step, i.e., one that reduces the total error, does \u03b1 again assume a non-zero value. Considering the selection of weights in neural nets as a problem in classical nonlinear optimization theory, the rationale for algorithms seeking only those weights that produce the globally minimum error is reviewed and rejected."

We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. In our approach, learning rates can increase as well as decrease, making it suitable for non-stationary problems. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of SGD or other adaptive approaches with their best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning."

While inference is typically slow due to its undirected nature, we argue that the emerging feature hierarchy is still explicit enough to be traversed in a feedforward fashion. The claim is corroborated by training a set of deep neural networks on real data and measuring the evolution of the representation layer after layer. The analysis reveals that the deep Boltzmann machine produces a feed-forward hierarchy of increasingly invariant representations that clearly surpasses the layer-wise approach."

In this paper we pose the question: why do random weights sometimes do so well? Our answer is that certain convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and translation invariant, even with random weights. Based on this we demonstrate the viability of extremely fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures, thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. We then show that a surprising fraction of the performance of certain state-of-the-art methods can be attributed to the architecture alone."

This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set."

The regularizer can be viewed as a generalization of the first-order Tikhonov stabilizer to dynamic models. For two layer networks with recurrent connections described by the training criterion with the regularizer is where = {U, V, W} is the network parameter set, Z(t) are the targets, I(t) = {X(s), s = 1,2, , t} represents the current and all historical input information, N is the size of the training data set, is the regularizer, and is a regularization parameter. The closed-form expression for the regularizer for time-lagged recurrent networks is where is the Euclidean matrix norm and is a factor that depends upon the maximal value of the first derivatives of the internal unit activations f(). Simplifications of the regularizer are obtained for simultaneous recurrent nets ( 0), two-layer feedforward nets, and one layer linear nets.

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

                "text": "Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting."

Recent work (see Bengio (2009) for a review) shows that training deep architectures is a good way to extract such representations, by extracting and disentangling gradually higher-level factors of variation characterizing the input distribution. In this paper, we describe different kinds of layers we trained for learning representations in the setting of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge. The strategy of our team won the final phase of the challenge. It combined and stacked different one-layer unsupervised learning algorithms, adapted to each of the five datasets of the competition. This paper describes that strategy and the particular one-layer learning algorithms feeding a simple linear classifier with a tiny number of labeled training samples (1 to 64 per class)."

Our method is practical, easy to use, scales nicely to very large datasets, and isn't limited in applicability to auto-encoders, or any specific model class.

We show that a simple denoising autoencoder training criterion is equivalent to matching the score (with respect to the data) of a specific energy-based model to that of a nonparametric Parzen density estimator of the data. This yields several useful insights. It defines a proper probabilistic model for the denoising autoencoder technique, which makes it in principle possible to sample from them or rank examples by their energy. It suggests a different way to apply score matching that is related to learning to denoise and does not require computing second derivatives. It justifies the use of tied weights between the encoder and decoder and suggests ways to extend the success of denoising autoencoders to a larger family of energy-based models."

Using convolutional (tied) weights significantly reduces the number of parameters that have to be learned, and also allows translational invariance to be hard-coded into the architecture. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning invariances, rather than relying on hard-coding. We propose tiled convolution neural networks (Tiled CNNs), which use a regular \"tiled\" pattern of tied weights that does not require that adjacent hidden units share identical weights, but instead requires only that hidden units k steps away from each other to have tied weights. By pooling over neighboring units, this architecture is able to learn complex invariances (such as scale and rotational invariance) beyond translational invariance. Further, it also enjoys much of CNNs' advantage of having a relatively small number of learned parameters (such as ease of learning and greater scalability). We provide an efficient learning algorithm for Tiled CNNs based on Topographic ICA, and show that learning complex invariant features allows us to achieve highly competitive results for both the NORB and CIFAR-10 datasets."

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations."

Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difficult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classifier. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We find that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We find that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of \"deep\" vs. \"shallower\" representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

We demonstrate that Stochastic Maximum Likelihood is superior when using the Restricted Boltzmann Machine as a classifier, and that the algorithm can be greatly improved using the technique of iterate averaging from the field of stochastic approximation. We further show that training with optimal parameters for classification does not necessarily lead to optimal results when Restricted Boltzmann Machines are stacked to form a Deep Belief Network. In our experiments we observe that fine tuning a Deep Belief Network significantly changes the distribution of the latent data, even though the parameter changes are negligible."

The final 10 papers in volume 1 discuss generalized learning and ruleinduction techniques. They are interesting and informative, particularly \u201cGeneralization and Noise\u201d by Y. Kodratoff and M. Manango, which discusses symbolic and numeric rule induction. Most rule-induction techniques focus on the use of examples and numeric analysis such as repertory grids. Kodratoff\u2019s and Manango\u2019s exploration of how the two complement each other is refreshing. Because of their technical nature and the amount of work it would take to put their content to use, most of the papers in this section of the volume are more appropriate for a specialized or research-oriented group. For those just getting involved in knowledge-based\u2013systems development, Knowledge Acquisition Tools for Expert Systems is the more useful volume. In addition to discussing the tools themselves, most of the papers contain details of the knowledgeacquisition techniques that are automated, thus providing much of the same information which is available in the first volume. As an added benefit, they also often discuss the underlying architectures for solving domain-specific problems. For instance, the details of the medical diagnostic architecture laid out in \u201cDesign for Acquisition: Principles of Knowledge System Design to Facilitate Knowledge Acquisition\u201d by T. R. Gruber and P. R. Cohen are almost as useful as the discussion of how to build a knowledge-acquisition system. Volume 2 is particularly germane given the rise in commercial interest about automated knowledge acquisition following this year\u2019s introduction of Neuron Data\u2019s NEXTRATM product and last year\u2019s introduction of Test Bench by Texas Instruments. Test Bench is actually discussed in \u201cA Mixed-Initiative Workbench for Knowledge Acquisition\u201d by G. S. Kahn, E. H. Breaux, P. De Klerk, and R. L. Joseph. This volume provides the background necessary to evaluate knowledge-acquisition tools such as NEXTRA, Test Bench, and AutoIntelligence (IntelligenceWare). The vendors of knowledge-based\u2013systems development tools, for example, Inference, IntelliCorp, Aion, AI Corp., and IBM, would do well to pay heed to these books because they point the way to removing the knowledge bottleneck from knowledge-based\u2013systems development. Overall, the papers in both volumes are comprehensive and well integrated, a sometimes difficult state to achieve when compiling a collection of papers resulting from a small conference. The collection is comparable to Anna Hart\u2019s Knowledge Acquisition for Expert Systems (McGraw-Hill, 1986), but it is broader in scope and not as structured. The arrangement of the papers is marred only by an overly brief index. Few readers can be expected to read a collection from beginning to end, and a better index would facilitate more enlightened use. Less important\u2014but nevertheless distracting\u2014is the large number of typographical errors in both volumes. In conclusion, the set is recommended for both the commercial and research knowledge-based\u2013systems practitioner. Reading the volumes in reverse order might be more useful to the commercial developer given the extra information available in volume 2. Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research"

Although that direction can be very expensive to compute we develop an efficient, general, online approximation to the natural gradient descent which is suited to large scale problems.

The corresponding singular values specify how much local variation is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while remaining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples that are consistent with the local structure captured by a contractive auto-encoder. The associated stochastic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly and mix well between modes, compared to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure can also be used to train the second layer of contraction that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of variation discovered in the first layer. We show that this can help learn and represent invariances present in the data and improve classification error."

The S3C model resembles both the spike-and-slab RBM and sparse coding. Since exact inference in this model is intractable, we derive a structured variational inference procedure and employ a variational EM training algorithm. Prior work on approximate inference for this model has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale to enormous problem sizes. We present an inference procedure appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors. \nWe demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the ssRBM on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We evaluate our approach's potential for semi-supervised learning on subsets of CIFAR-10. We demonstrate state-of-the art self-taught learning performance on the STL-10 dataset and use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge."

Tieleman (2008) showed that better learning can be achieved by estimating the model's statistics using a small set of persistent \"fantasy particles\" that are not reinitialized to data points after each weight update. With sufficiently small weight updates, the fantasy particles represent the equilibrium distribution accurately but to explain why the method works with much larger weight updates it is necessary to consider the interaction between the weight updates and the Markov chain. We show that the weight updates force the Markov chain to mix fast, and using this insight we develop an even faster mixing chain that uses an auxiliary set of \"fast weights\" to implement a temporary overlay on the energy landscape. The fast weights learn rapidly but also decay rapidly and do not contribute to the normal energy landscape that defines the model."

Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains."

                "text": "While many models of biological object recognition share a common set of \u201cbroad-stroke\u201d properties, the performance of any one model depends strongly on the choice of parameters in a particular instantiation of that model\u2014e.g., the number of units per layer, the size of pooling kernels, exponents in normalization operations, etc. Since the number of such parameters (explicit or implicit) is typically large and the computational cost of evaluating one particular parameter set is high, the space of possible model instantiations goes largely unexplored. Thus, when a model fails to approach the abilities of biological visual systems, we are left uncertain whether this failure is because we are missing a fundamental idea or because the correct \u201cparts\u201d have not been tuned correctly, assembled at sufficient scale, or provided with enough training. Here, we present a high-throughput approach to the exploration of such parameter sets, leveraging recent advances in stream processing hardware (high-end NVIDIA graphic cards and the PlayStation 3's IBM Cell Processor). In analogy to high-throughput screening approaches in molecular biology and genetics, we explored thousands of potential network architectures and parameter instantiations, screening those that show promising object recognition performance for further analysis. We show that this approach can yield significant, reproducible gains in performance across an array of basic object recognition tasks, consistently outperforming a variety of state-of-the-art purpose-built vision systems from the literature. As the scale of available computational power continues to expand, we argue that this approach has the potential to greatly accelerate progress in both artificial vision and our understanding of the computational underpinning of biological vision."

A two step process is described where the rst problem is to model the stochastic relationship between sample patterns and their classes using a stochastic neural network. Then we convert the stochastic network to a deterministic one, which calculates the a-posteriori probabilities of the stochastic counterpart. That is, the outputs of the nal network estimate a-posteriori probabilities by construction. The well-known method of normalizing network outputs by applying the softmax function in order to allow a probabilistic interpretation is shown to be more than a heuristic, since it is well-founded in the context of stochastic networks. Simulation results show a performance of our networks superior to standard multilayer networks in the case of few training samples and a large number of classes."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

The power of the method is illustrated on synthetic time-series with different time-lag dependencies and noise levels and on the sunspot data.

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator Rv{f(w)} = (/r)f(w rv)|r=0, note that Rv{w} = Hv and Rv{w} = v, and then apply Rv{} to the equations used to compute w. The result is an exact and numerically stable procedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation, and is about as local, as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique to a one pass gradient calculation algorithm (backpropagation), a relaxation gradient calculation algorithm (recurrent backpropagation), and two stochastic gradient calculation algorithms (Boltzmann machines and weight perturbation). Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating any need to calculate the full Hessian."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

The paper begins with a precise definition of the problem, then general strategies are presented for enhancing the performance of classification algorithms on this type of problem. These strategies are tested on two domains. The first domain is the diagnosis of gas turbine engines. The problem is to diagnose a faulty engine in one context, such as warm weather, when the fault has previously been seen only in another context, such as cold weather. The second domain is speech recognition. The problem is to recognize words spoken by a new speaker, not represented in the training set. For both domains, exploiting context results in substantially more accurate classification."

Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.

While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Specifically, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge filters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive fields. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the first layer responses in the data. Specifically, it picks up both colinear (\"contour\") features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex \"corner\" features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu's study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features."

The authors propose the prediction risk as a measure of the generalization ability of multi-layer perceptron networks and use it to select the optimal network architecture. The prediction risk must be estimated from the available data. The authors approximate the prediction risk by v-fold cross-validation and asymptotic estimates of generalized cross-validation or H. Akaike's (1970) final prediction error. They apply the technique to the problem of predicting corporate bond ratings. This problem is very attractive as a case study, since it is characterized by the limited availability of the data and by the lack of complete a priori information that could be used to impose a structure to the network architecture.<<ETX>>"

We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pretraining."

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces \"stroke detectors\" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps."

We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classification results are obtained."

Although the primary physical variables in the model are the membrane potentials of neurons, the equations which govern the means and covariances of the membrane potentials are coupled through the average firing rates; as a consequence, the average firing rates control the selective storage and retrieval of covariance information. Motor learning in the cerebellar cortex is treated as a problem of covariance storage, and a prediction is made for the underlying synaptic plasticity: the change in synaptic strength between a parallel fiber and a Purkinje cell should be proportional to the covariance between discharges in the parallel fiber and the climbing fiber. Unlike previous proposals for synaptic plasticity, this prediction requires both facilitation and depression to occur (under different conditions) at the same synapse."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets."

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously."

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

The paper begins with a precise definition of the problem, then general strategies are presented for enhancing the performance of classification algorithms on this type of problem. These strategies are tested on three domains. The first domain is the diagnosis of gas turbine engines. The problem is to diagnose a faulty engine in one context, such as warm weather, when the fault has previously been seen only in another context, such as cold weather. The second domain is speech recognition. The context is given by the identity of the speaker. The problem is to recognize words spoken by a new speaker, not represented in the training set. The third domain is medical prognosis. The problem is to predict whether a patient with hepatitis will live or die. The context is the age of the patient. For all three domains, exploiting context results in substantially more accurate classification."

These models can adapt easily during testing to new styles or content, allowing us to solve three general tasks: extrapolation of a new style to unobserved content; classification of content observed in a new style; and translation of new content observed in a new style. For classification, we embed bilinear models in a probabilistic framework, Separable Mixture Models (SMMs), which generalizes earlier work on factorial mixture models [7, 3]. Significant performance improvement on a benchmark speech dataset shows the benefits of our approach."

Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%."

                "text": "This paper describes the performance characteristics of the LMS adaptive filter, a digital filter composed of a tapped delay line and adjustable weights, whose impulse response is controlled by an adaptive algorithm. For stationary stochastic inputs, the mean-square error, the difference between the filter output and an externally supplied input called the \"desired response,\" is a quadratic function of the weights, a paraboloid with a single fixed minimum point that can be sought by gradient techniques. The gradient estimation process is shown to introduce noise into the weight vector that is proportional to the speed of adaptation and number of weights. The effect of this noise is expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity \"misadjustment\" that is a measure of the deviation from optimal Wiener performance. Analysis of a simple nonstationary case, in which the minimum point of the error surface is moving according to an assumed first-order Markov process, shows that an additional contribution to misadjustment arises from \"lag\" of the adaptive process in tracking the moving minimum point. This contribution, which is additive, is proportional to the number of weights but inversely proportional to the speed of adaptation. The sum of the misadjustments can be minimized by choosing the speed of adaptation to make equal the two contributions. It is further shown, in Appendix A, that for stationary inputs the LMS adaptive algorithm, based on the method of steepest descent, approaches the theoretical limit of efficiency in terms of misadjustment and speed of adaptation when the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix are equal or close in value. When the eigenvalues are highly disparate (\u03bbmax/\u03bbmin> 10), an algorithm similar to LMS but based on Newton's method would approach this theoretical limit very closely."

Unlike previous methods, it explicitly takes into account the information-theoretic complexity of the code generator. It computes lococodes that convey information about the input data and can be computed and decoded by low-complexity mappings. We implement LOCOCODE by training autoassociators with flat minimum search, a recent, general method for discovering low-complexity neural nets. It turns out that this approach can unmix an unknown number of independent data sources by extracting a minimal number of low-complexity features necessary for representing the data. Experiments show that unlike codes obtained with standard autoencoders, lococodes are based on feature detectors, never unstructured, usually sparse, and sometimes factorial or local (depending on statistical properties of the data). Although LOCOCODE is not explicitly designed to enforce sparse or factorial codes, it extracts optimal codes for difficult versions of the bars benchmark problem, whereas independent component analysis (ICA) and principal component analysis (PCA) do not. It produces familiar, biologically plausible feature detectors when applied to real-world images and codes with fewer bits per pixel than ICA and PCA. Unlike ICA, it does not need to know the number of independent sources. As a preprocessor for a vowel recognition benchmark problem, it sets the stage for excellent classification performance. Our results reveal an interesting, previously ignored connection between two important fields: regularizer research and ICA-related research. They may represent a first step toward unification of regularization and unsupervised learning."

However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach."

A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

Selecting the best heuristics and tuning their parameters for optimal overall performance is often a difficult, tedious, and unsatisfying task. This thesis studies the automation of this important part of algorithm design: the configuration of discrete algorithm components and their continuous parameters to construct an algorithm with desirable empirical performance characteristics. Automated configuration procedures can facilitate algorithm development and be applied on the end user side to optimize performance for new instance types and optimization objectives. The use of such procedures separates high-level cognitive tasks carried out by humans from tedious low-level tasks that can be left to machines. We introduce two alternative algorithm configuration frameworks: iterated local search in parameter configuration space and sequential optimization based on response surface models. To the best of our knowledge, our local search approach is the first that goes beyond local optima. Our model-based search techniques significantly outperform existing techniques and extend them in ways crucial for general algorithm configuration: they can handle categorical parameters, optimization objectives defined across multiple instances, and tens of thousands of data points. We study how many runs to perform for evaluating a parameter configuration and how to set the cutoff time, after which algorithm runs are terminated unsuccessfully. We introduce data-driven approaches for making these choices adaptively, most notably the first general method for adaptively setting the cutoff time. Using our procedures\u2014to the best of our knowledge still the only ones applicable to these complex configuration tasks\u2014we configured state-of-the-art tree search and local search algorithms for SAT, as well as CPLEX, the most widely-used commercial optimization tool for solving mixed integer programs (MIP). In many cases, we achieved improvements of orders of magnitude over the algorithm default, thereby substantially improving the state of the art in solving a broad range of problems, including industrially relevant instances of SAT and MIP. Based on these results, we believe that automated algorithm configuration procedures, such as ours, will play an increasingly crucial role in the design of high-performance algorithms and will be widely used in academia and industry."

Our methods are primal-dual since they are always able to generate a feasible approximation to the optimum of an appropriately formulated dual problem. Besides other advantages, this useful feature provides the methods with a reliable stopping criterion. The proposed schemes differ from the classical approaches (divergent series methods, mirror descent methods) by presence of two control sequences. The first sequence is responsible for aggregating the support functions in the dual space, and the second one establishes a dynamically updated scale between the primal and dual spaces. This additional flexibility allows to guarantee a boundedness of the sequence of primal test points even in the case of unbounded feasible set (however, we always assume the uniform boundedness of subgradients). We present the variants of subgradient schemes for nonsmooth convex minimization, minimax problems, saddle point problems, variational inequalities, and stochastic optimization. In all situations our methods are proved to be optimal from the view point of worst-case black-box lower complexity bounds."

                "text": "Reports of experiments conducted with an Inductive Logic Programming system rarely describe how specific values of parameters of the system are arrived at when constructing models. Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given \"factory-supplied\" default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: specifically, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufficiently well-defined to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system's hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local \"response surface\". The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks. The results suggest that computational overheads from this preliminary phase are not substantial, and that much can be gained, both on improving system performance and on enabling controlled experimentation, by adopting well-established procedures such as the ones proposed here."

In this paper we optimize the searching process for tangent distance (Simard, LeCun and Denker, 1993) to improve speed performance. The closest prototypes are found by recursively searching included subsets of the database using distances of increasing complexity. This is done by using a hierarchy of tangent distances (increasing the Humber of tangent. vectors from 0 to its maximum) and multiresolution (using wavelets). At each stage, a confidence level of the classification is computed. If the confidence is high enough, the computation of more complex distances is avoided. The resulting algorithm applied to character recognition is close to three orders of magnitude faster than computing the full tangent distance on every prototypes."

A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach."

In this paper we provide extensive empirical results showing that combined forecasts obtained through weighted averages can be quite accurate. Five procedures for estimating weights are investigated, and two appear to be superior to the others. These two procedures provide forecasts that are more accurate overall than forecasts from individual methods. Furthermore, they are superior to forecasts found from a simple unweighted average of the same methods."

The first stage is often composed of three main modules: (1) a bank of filters (often oriented edge detectors); (2) a non-linear transform, such as a point-wise squashing functions, quantization, or normalization; (3) a spatial pooling operation which combines the outputs of similar filters over neighboring regions. We propose a method that automatically learns such feature extractors in an unsupervised fashion by simultaneously learning the filters and the pooling units that combine multiple filter outputs together. The method automatically generates topographic maps of similar filters that extract features of orientations, scales, and positions. These similar filters are pooled together, producing locally-invariant outputs. The learned feature descriptors give comparable results as SIFT on image recognition tasks for which SIFT is well suited, and better results than SIFT on tasks for which SIFT is less well suited."

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues. Numerous applications are provided throughout.Lise Getoor is Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland.

The algorithm is based on a probit regression model that maps discrete or real-valued input features to probabilities. It maintains Gaussian beliefs over weights of the model and performs Gaussian online updates derived from approximate message passing. Scalability of the algorithm is ensured through a principled weight pruning procedure and an approximate parallel implementation. We discuss the challenges arising from evaluating and tuning the predictor as part of the complex system of sponsored search where the predictions made by the algorithm decide about future training sample composition. Finally, we show experimental results from the production system and compare to a calibrated Naive Bayes algorithm."

We use a local linear discriminant analysis to estimate an effective metric for computing neighborhoods. We determine the local decision boundaries from centroid information, and then shrink neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to these local decision boundaries, and elongate them parallel to the boundaries. Thereafter, any neighborhood-based classifier can be employed, using the modified neighborhoods. The posterior probabilities tend to be more homogeneous in the modified neighborhoods. We also propose a method for global dimension reduction, that combines local dimension information. In a number of examples, the methods demonstrate the potential for substantial improvements over nearest neighbour classification."
