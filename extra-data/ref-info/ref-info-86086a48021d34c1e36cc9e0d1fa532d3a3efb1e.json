In this contribution, we introduce a model-based approach for the recognition of pedestrians. We represent the human body by a 3D-model consisting of cylinders, whereas for modelling the movement of walking we use data from medical motion studies. The estimation of model parameters in consecutive images is done by applying a Kalman filter. Experimental results are shown for synthetic as well as for real image data."

The problem considered is that of a rigid body undergoing unknown rotational and translational motion. The measurement data consists of a sequence of noisy image coordinates of two or more object correspondence points. By modeling the object dynamics as a function of time, estimates of the model parameters (including motion parameters) can be extracted from the data using recursive and/or batch techniques. This permits a desired degree of smoothing to be achieved through the use of an arbitrarily large number of images. Some assumptions regarding object structure are presently made. Results are presented for a recursive estimation procedure: the case considered here is that of a sequence of one dimensional images of a two dimensional object. Thus, the object moves in one transverse dimension, and in depth, preserving the fundamental ambiguity of the central projection image model (loss of depth information). An iterated extended Kalman filter is used for the recursive solution. Noise levels of 5-10 percent of the object image size are used. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived for the model parameter estimates as a function of object trajectory and noise level. This approach may be of use in situations where it is difficult to resolve large numbers of object match points, but relatively long sequences of images (10 to 20 or more) are available."

The domain of human motion lends itself to a model-driven analysis, and the system includes a detailed model of the human body. All information extracted from the image is interpreted through a constraint network based on the structure of the human model. A constraint propagation operator is defined and its theoretical properties outlined.

Sometimes with the articulated object, the detection of the articulation is difficult depending on the deformation or the direction of the view line. Also, the false articulation is detected due to the disconnection of the object contour derived from the image or due to the noise. \n \n \n \nTo cope with such difficulties, a method is proposed for the moving articulated object, where the articulation is detected with a high reliability, and the description as well as the segmentation of the articulated object are derived by processing a series of images containing different outblocks and deformations of the object. In this method, the ribbon, which is the two-dimensional version of the generalized cylinder, is used as the basic representation for the part. The initial description is derived from each frame image, and the initial descriptions of various frames are compared by ribbon matching to detect the articulation position with a high reliability. Based on the detected positions, the initial descriptions are integrated selectively and the final description is obtained. As a by-product of the ribbon matching, the tracking of parts also is realized. By an experiment using a human walking scene, the usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated."

Finding correspondence of regions and their segments in a sequence of input frames by a new flexible template matching method, the analyzer tracks moving regions and their segments in the dynamic images. Next a similarity test of segment movements detects the background movement, and classifies the regions into stationary and nonstationary ones. Each in the latter group is further labeled as partly occluded, false, or moving, by examining both motion patterns of its segments and temporal change of its structure. Finally, the analyzer merges segments of each moving object into groups, having similar motion patterns, in order to obtain a meaningful partition corresponding to its components such as hands or legs."

The displays studied differ from those examined by previous researchers in that 1) objects are represented by a relatively small number of points, 2) objects are not rigid, and 3) the viewing geometry is such that highly varying degrees of perspective distortion occur. An algorithm is presented which segments the points of an MLD of a wire-frame man into body parts. The relationship of this algorithm to previous theories of MLD perception and actual human performance is discussed."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

Knowledge about a locomotion cycle is incorporated into a hierarchical control process. The desired locomotion is conveniently specified at the top level as a task (e.g. walk at speed v), which is then decomposed by application of the concepts of step symmetry and state-phase-timings. As a result of this decomposition, the forces and torques that drive the dynamic model of the legs are determined by numerical approximation techniques. Rather than relying on a general dynamic model, the equations of motion of the legs are tailored to locomotion and analytically constrained to allow for only a specific range of movements. The dynamics of the legs produce a generic, natural locomotion pattern which is visually upgraded by some kinematic \"cosmetics\" derived from such principles as virtual leg and determinants of gait. A system has been implemented based on these principles and has shown that when a few parameters, such as velocity, step length and step frequency are specified, a wide variety of human walks can be generated in almost real-time."

At present, truly lifelike motion is produced mainly by copying recorded images, a tedious and lengthy process that requires considerable external equipment. An alternative is the use of dynamic analysis to predict realistic motion. Using dynamic motion control, bodies are treated as masses acting under the influence of external and internal forces and torques. Dynamic control is advantageous because motion is naturally restricted to physically realizable patterns, and many types of motion can be predicted automatically. Use of dynamics is computationally expensive and specifying controlling forces and torques can be difficult. However, there is evidence that dynamics offers hope for more realistic, natural, and automatic motion control. Because such motion simulates real world conditions, an animation system using dynamic analysis is also a useful tool in such related fields as robotics and biomechanics."

This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity. The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented. >"

With this method we have studied the gait patterns of 60 men and have delineated the ranges of normal values for 16 excursions during free speed walking (1). In analyzing the data obtained in this study, we noted that certain displacement patterns appeared to relate to the speed of walking. I n the presenl; study, therefore, we have compared the displacement patterns of free and fast speed walking for 30 of the men previously studied. Since the subjects selected represent broad ranges of age and height, the normal values obtained for this fast speed study should provide much-needed baselines for comparison of a wide variety of pathological gaits in which the speed deficit is manifested. Although the effect of speed on normal locomotion has been studied by many investigators, these studies have been confined for the most part to the temporal components of the walking cycle and to stride dimensions. The effect of walking speed on the various temporal components of walking has been studied extensively (2-8). There is general agreement that the duration of the phases of the walking cycle decreases with increased cadence. The relationship between step length and step rate has also been studied by many investigators (3, 8-12). Despite the lack of conformity in the various experimental methods, it was apparent that increased walking speeds, up to a point, are accomplished by decreasing the step duration and by increasing the step length. Hoffman (13), Basler (2), and Morton (14) all observed straightening of the foot angles with increased walking speeds. Weber (8), Carlet (3), and Farfel (lo), with different"

However, in order to represent such objects more realistically, their physical properties must be examined. This paper describes a method for modelling cloth material hanging in three dimensions when supported by any number of constraint points. The cloth synthesized with this model contains folds and appears more realistic than simple texture mapping. This paper also describes a method for rendering the cloth once its free-hanging shape has been determined.The computation of the surface of a free-hanging cloth is performed in two stages. The first stage approximates the shape of the surface which is interior to the constraint points, and the second stage performs a relaxation process on all points on the surface to arrive at a close approximation to its shape. The rendering of the surfaces is done using a ray-tracer which treats the surface as a mesh of line segments."

Even so, theoretical and mathematical concepts are introduced and developed sufficiently to make the book a self-contained source of instruction for readers without prior knowledge of the basic principles of the field. The work is the product of the technical staff of the The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC), an organization whose success has resulted largely from its applications of optimal estimation techniques to a wide variety of real situations involving large-scale systemsArthur Gelb writes in the Foreword that \"It is our intent throughout to provide a simple and interesting picture of the central issues underlying modern estimation theory and practice. Heuristic, rather than theoretically elegant, arguments are used extensively, with emphasis on physical insights and key questions of practical importance.\"Numerous illustrative examples, many based on actual applications, have been interspersed throughout the text to lead the student to a concrete understanding of the theoretical material. The inclusion of problems with \"built-in\" answers at the end of each of the nine chapters further enhances the self-study potential of the text.After a brief historical prelude, the book introduces the mathematics underlying random process theory and state-space characterization of linear dynamic systems. The theory and practice of optimal estimation is them presented, including filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Both linear and non-linear systems, and continuous- and discrete-time cases, are covered in considerable detail. New results are described concerning the application of covariance analysis to non-linear systems and the connection between observers and optimal estimators. The final chapters treat such practical and often pivotal issues as suboptimal structure, and computer loading considerations.This book is an outgrowth of a course given by TASC at a number of US Government facilities. Virtually all of the members of the TASC technical staff have, at one time and in one way or another, contributed to the material contained in the work"

Ribbon, which is a 2-D analog of a generalized cone, is used as the basic shape representation scheme. An initial description for each frame is the collection of composed ribbons, which is obtained after filtering out most inadequate ribbons and grouping the remaining ribbons by using geometric constraints. Ribbon matching is then conducted between different frames and ribbons which match are retained. From the retained ribbons, the geometric constraints make integrated descriptions and the tracking of parts is established from the ribbon matching results. Since the ribbon matching allows one ribbon to be matched with two ribbons, an articulation which is not detected in one frame but is detected in another frame can be recovered. Experimental results are also shown.<<ETX>>"
