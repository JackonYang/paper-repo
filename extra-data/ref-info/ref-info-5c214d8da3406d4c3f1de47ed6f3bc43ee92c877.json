The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

                "text": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and interconnexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

This ability seems related to the specificity and complexity of stimuli needed for activation of single neurones of the visual cortex, in contrast to the relatively unselective requirements of retinal and lateral geniculate neurones. The retina and tectum of some lower vertebrates including frogs, pigeons and rabbits, already possess selective cells responding to very specific aspects of stimulation. The class differences are in part connected with the chiasmatic decussation and mechanisms of binocular and stereoptic vision which are prominent in the visual cortex of animals with forward looking rather than laterally placed eyes. They are also associated with the enormously expanded behavioural repertoire of, for instance, primates in comparision to lower vertebrate forms. The complex primate cortex permits a rich interaction and modification of cellular performance according to the momentary needs and disposition of the individual. The opportunities which allow plasticity of performance also unfortunately often lead to response unpredictability, despite careful laboratory controls."

Lorente de No (29) also described neuron chains of varying complexity within each column. Some chains were simple two-neuron arcs, with the afferent fiber synapsing directly onto an output cell. Other chains involved various numbers of interneurons between input and output. Implicit in this concept of multiple neuron chains is the notion that any given column has multiple functions and multiple outputs. Hubel and Wiesel (24, 26) have postulated a single neuron chain in visual cortex, involving afferent axons, simple cells, complex cells, and (more recently) hypercomplex cells. In cat visual cortex most of the cells (233/303 or 77yo) had simple properties (24), whereas in monkeys most of the cells (1771272 or 65y0) were complex (26). Xn the course of experiments dealing primarily with co,lor properties of neurons in monkey visual cortex (13), it became evident that complex cells did not constitute a single homogeneous group, but included several subclasses. When the recording sites were determined histologically, the physiologically defined subclasses of complex cells turned out to have different laminar distributions. The physiologic properties used to define the new cell classes are presented in this paper, and the laminar distributions are shown. Some important differences be-"

The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 180\u2013360\u00b0 were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25\u201350 \u03bc, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stepwise changes in orientation of about 10\u00b0 could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionally a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90\u00b0. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25\u20130.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 \u03bc the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180\u00b0 took place over a distance of 0.5\u20131.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive\u2010field orientation shifts."

Only Poggio (36), however, has examined the fovea1 representation in unanesthetized, painlessly immobilized monkevs where full control of visual stimulation \u2018could be maintained. His analysis concentrated on the spatial properties of the effective stimuli. Several units were found to change their characteristics during the course of analysis, thus raising the possibility that the processes of \u201cfeature extraction,\u201d if they in fact exist, may be more dynamic than they appear to be under anesthesia. Using a preparation similar to Poggio\u2019s, we have looked at this system in a somewhat different manner. First, besides determining the effective spatial properties of the stimulus, whenever possible we have also determined the latency of response to stroboscopic flashes and to electrical stimulation of optic tract (OT) or optic radiation (OR), We hoped thereby to assess to some degree the directness of the afferent access to different classes of units. Second, we have examined the response to diffuse illumination at various intensities. This has revealed a type of unit heretofore unrecognized in striate cortex of any species and which, surprisingly, constituted more than one-third of the units in the fovea1 representation in striate cortex of the unanesthetized squirrel monkey. We have termed this new class of units \u201cluxotonic\u201dl to re-"
