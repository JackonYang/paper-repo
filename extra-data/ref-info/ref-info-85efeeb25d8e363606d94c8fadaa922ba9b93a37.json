If A and B are close to being the same shape, then a vision system should report a match and return a measure of how good that match is. To be useful this measure should satisfy a number of properties, including: (1) it should be a metric, (2) it should be invariant under translation, rotation, and change-of-scale, (3) it should be reasonably easy to compute, and (4) it should match our intuition (i.e., answers should be similar to those that a person might give). We develop a method for comparing polygons that has these properties. The method works for both convex and nonconvex polygons and runs in time O(mn log mn) where m is the number of vertices in one polygon and n is the number of vertices in the other. Some examples are presented that show the method produces answers that are intuitively reasonable."

Huttenlocher, Kedem, and Sharir have shown that this minimum distance can be found by constructing the upper envelope of certain Voronoi surfaces. Further, they show that if the two sets are each of cardinality n then the complexity of the upper envelope of such surfaces is \u03a9(n3). We examine the question of whether one can get around this cubic lower bound, and show that under the L1 and L\u221e metrics, the time to compute the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets is On2 log2n)."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

In one form this is commonly referred to as the \"bin-picking\" problem, in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2\u00bd-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems."
