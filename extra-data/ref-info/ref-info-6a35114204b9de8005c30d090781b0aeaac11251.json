In this paper, we present a word spotting system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that uses trained subword models to spot keywords. With the proposed method, arbitrary keywords can be spotted that do not need to be present in the training set. Also, no text line segmentation is required. On the modern IAM off-line database and the historical George Washington database we show that the proposed system outperforms a standard template matching approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW)."

In the present paper, a novel keyword spotting system for handwritten documents is described. It is derived from a neural network based system for unconstrained handwriting recognition. As such it performs template-free spotting, i.e. it is not necessary for a keyword to appear in the training set. The keyword spotting is done using a modification of the CTC Token Passing algorithm. We demonstrate that such a system has the potential for high performance. For example, a precision of 95% at 50% recall is reached for the 4,000 most frequent words on the IAM offline handwriting database."

The presented features are inspired by the SIFT keypoint descriptor, widely employed in computer vision and object recognition, but underexploited in the handwriting recognition field. In our approach, a sliding window moves from left to right over a word image. At each position, the window is subdivided into cells, and in each cell a histogram of orientations is accumulated. Experiments using two different word spotting systems hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping demonstrate a very significant improvement when using the proposed features with respect to the state-of-the-art ones."

A set of visual templates is used to define the keyword class of interest, and initiate a search for words exhibiting high shape similarity to the model set. Major problems of segmenting cursive script into individual words are avoided by applying line-oriented processing to the document pages. The use of profile-oriented features facilitates the application of dynamic programming techniques to pattern matching, and allows us to achieve high levels of recognition performance. Results of experiments with old Spanish manuscripts show a high recognition rate of the proposed approach."

For each user-specified keyword, an HMM is created by concatenating appropriate context-dependent character HMMs. Nonkeywords are modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent subcharacter models. Keyword spotting is performed using a Viterbi search through the HMM network created by connecting the keyword and nonkeyword HMMs in parallel.

We describe an approach called word spotting which involves grouping word images into clusters of similar words by using image matching to find similarity. By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques. It is shown in a subset of the George Washington collection that such a word spotting technique can outperform a Hidden Markov Model word-based recognition technique in terms of word error rates."

We describe an approach called word spotting which involves grouping word images into clusters of similar words by using image matching to find similarity. By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques. It is shown in a subset of the George Washington collection that such a word spotting technique can outperform a Hidden Markov Model word-based recognition technique in terms of word error rates."

The system accepts a query in the form of text from the user and returns a ranked list of word images from document image corpus based on similarity with the query word. The system is divided into two main components. The first component known as Indexer, performs indexing of all word images present in the document image corpus. This is achieved by extracting Moment Based features from word images and storing them as index. A template is generated for keyword spotting which stores the mapping of a keyword string to its corresponding word image which is used for generating query feature vector. The second component, Similarity Matcher, returns a ranked list of word images which are most similar to the query based on a cosine similarity metric. A manual Relevance feedback is applied based on Rocchio\u2019s formula, which re-formulates the query vector to return an improved ranked listing of word images. The performance of the system is seen to be superior on printed text than on handwritten text. Experiments are reported on documents of three different languages: English, Hindi and Sanskrit. For handwritten English, an average precision of 67% was obtained for 30 query words. For machine printed Hindi, an average precision of 71% was obtained for 75 query words and for Sanskrit, an average precision of 87% with 100 queries was obtained.

Examples include the early Presidential papers at the Library of Congress and the collected works of W. B. DuBois at the library of the University of Massachusetts. The standard technique for indexing documents is to scan them in, convert them to machine readable form (ASCII) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then index them using a text retrieval engine. However, OCR does not work well on handwriting. Here, an alternative scheme is proposed for indexing such texts. Each page of the document is segmented into words. The images of the words are then matched against each other to create equivalence classes (each equivalence classes contains multiple instances of the same word). The user then provides ASCII equivalents for say the top 2000 equivalence classes. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Due to variations in even a single person\u2019s handwriting, it is expected that the matching will be the most diff icult step in the whole process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method, based on Euclidean distance mapping, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method, based on an algorithm developed by Scott and Longuet-Higgins, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform.

In this contribution, we propose to apply this framework to handwritten word-spotting. Given a word image and a keyword generative model, the idea is to generate a vector which describes how the parameters of the keyword model should be modified to best fit the word image.This vector can then be used as the input of a discriminative classifier. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15\\% relative reduction of the error but the detector is approximately 15 times slower."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

                "text": "Many libraries, museums, and other organizations contain large collections of handwritten historical documents, for example, the papers of early presidents like George Washington at the Library of Congress. The first step in providing recognition/retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm have been mostly developed and tested on highly constrained documents like bank checks and postal addresses. There has been little work on full handwritten pages and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand, contain a great deal of noise and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten (historical) documents into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in images. Each line image is then filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to portions of characters at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale selection that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words. This is done by finding the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three different approaches. The blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to recover the words. A post processing filtering step is performed to eliminate boxes of unusual size which are unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown that, on 100 sampled documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a total error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a state-of-the-art gap metrics word-segmentation algorithm on this collection."

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on off-line printed and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, which leads to a significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes."

A entire text line is considered as an indivisible entity and is modeled with Hidden Markov Models. In this way, text line shallow parsing allows fast extraction of the relevant information in any document while rejecting at the same time irrelevant information. First results are promising and show the interest of the approach."

The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents)."

Since traditional handwriting recognizers based on optical character recognition (OCR) do not perform well on historical documents, recently a holistic word recognition approach has gained in popularity as an attractive and more straightforward solution (Lavrenko et\u00a0al. in proc. document Image Analysis for Libraries (DIAL\u201904), pp. 278\u2013287, 2004). Such techniques attempt to recognize words based on scalar and profile-based features extracted from whole word images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to holistic word recognition for historical handwritten manuscripts based on matching word contours instead of whole images or word profiles. The new method consists of robust extraction of closed word contours and the application of an elastic contour matching technique proposed originally for general shapes (Adamek and O\u2019Connor in IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 5:2004). We demonstrate that multiscale contour-based descriptors can effectively capture intrinsic word features avoiding any segmentation of words into smaller subunits. Our experiments show a recognition accuracy of 83%, which considerably exceeds the performance of other systems reported in the literature."

Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms. Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models, are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and for making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough in characterizing printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice \"elastic matching\" property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database that contains about 26000 words. Currently, the authors achieve a recognition accuracy of 99% when words in testing and training sets are of the same font size, and 96% when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM achieves only a 70% accuracy rate. >"

                "text": "Since their first inception more than half a century ago, automatic reading systems have evolved substantially, thereby showing impressive performance on machine-printed text. The recognition of handwriting can, however, still be considered an open research problem due to its substantial variation in appearance. With the introduction of Markovian models to the field, a promising modeling and recognition paradigm was established for automatic offline handwriting recognition. However, so far, no standard procedures for building Markov-model-based recognizers could be established though trends toward unified approaches can be identified. It is therefore the goal of this survey to provide a comprehensive overview of the application of Markov models in the research field of offline handwriting recognition, covering both the widely used hidden Markov models and the less complex Markov-chain or n-gram models. First, we will introduce the typical architecture of a Markov-model-based offline handwriting recognition system and make the reader familiar with the essential theoretical concepts behind Markovian models. Then, we will give a thorough review of the solutions proposed in the literature for the open problems how to apply Markov-model-based approaches to automatic offline handwriting recognition."

In order to make images of valuable old documents amenable to browsing, a transcription of high accuracy is needed. In this paper, two state-of-the art recognizers originally developed for modern scripts are applied to medieval documents. The first is based on Hidden Markov Models and the second uses a Neural Network with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. On a dataset of word images extracted from a medieval manuscript of the 13th century, written in Middle High German by several writers, it is demonstrated that a word accuracy of 93.32% is achievable. This is far above the word accuracy of 77.12% achieved with the same recognizers for unconstrained modern scripts written in English. These results encourage the development of real world systems for automatic transcription of historical documents with a view to image and text browsing in digital libraries."

The creation of readily available ground truth data plays a central role for the development of new recognition technologies. For historical documents, ground truth creation is more difficult and time-consuming when compared with modern documents. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic ground truth creation proceeding for historical documents that takes into account noisy background and transcription alignment. The proposed ground truth creation is demonstrated for the IAM Historical Handwriting Database (IAM-HistDB) that is currently under construction and will include several hundred Old German manuscripts. With a small set of algorithmic tools and few manual interactions, it is shown how laypersons can efficiently create a ground truth for handwriting recognition."

These collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus."

In this paper two general algorithms that have been proposed for word spotting and connected word recognition are studied. These algorithms are called the fixed range method and the local minimum method. The characteristics and properties of these algorithms are discussed. It is shown that, in several simple performance evaluations, the local minimum method performed considerably better then the fixed range method. Explanations of this behavior are given and an optimized method of applying the local minimum algorithm to word spotting and connected word recognition is described."

The wordspotting idea has previously been proposed as a solution to creating indexes for such documents and collections by matching word images. In this paper we present an algorithm which compares whole word-images based on their appearance. This algorithm recovers correspondences of points of interest in two images, and then uses these correspondences to construct a similarity measure. This similarity measure can then be used to rank word-images in order of their closeness to a querying image. We achieved an average precision of 62.57% on a set of 2372 images of reasonable quality and an average precision of 15.49% on a set of 3262 images from documents of poor quality that are even hard to read for humans."

The training of acoustic models to provide an explicit representation of nonvocabulary speech is investigated. A likelihood ratio scoring procedure is used to account for sources of variability affecting keyword likelihood scores. An acoustic class-dependent spectral normalization procedure is used to provide explicit compensation for linear channel effects. Keyword recognition results for a standard conversational speech task with a 20-keyword vocabulary reach 82% probability of detection at a false alarm rate of 12 false alarms per keyword per hour.<<ETX>>"

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

Documents range from ancient manuscripts, through early printed books, to typewritten administrative documents of the twentieth century. A common thread is that the documents are typically valued for their physical appearance as much as their content. The documents to be analysed can be originals (paper, parchment, etc.) or in image form (already scanned, possibly using now outdated technology). The key requirement is to be able to process these unique manuscripts, whether they are presented as free flowing text (e.g., treatises and novels) or structured at different levels of physical-logical structure correspondence (e.g., letters, census lists, trade forms). Degradation may be caused by a lifetime of use and physical deterioration. In addition to the original content, access must also be preserved to user annotations and corrections, stamps and unique artwork. Each class of document requires a different approach throughout the conversion process and lends itself to different levels of information extraction and description. As the application of existing technology to the analysis of historical documents exposes a myriad of weaknesses, novel and more robust methods are being developed to cope with this challenging problem.

Log-odds scoring is a means of evaluating this probability by comparing it to a null hypothesis, usually a simpler statistical model intended to represent the universe of sequences as a whole, rather than the group of interest. Such scoring leads to two immediate questions: what should the null model be, and what threshold of log-odds score should be deemed a match to the model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThis paper analyses these two issues experimentally. Within the context of the Sequence Alignment and Modeling software suite (SAM), we consider a variety of null models and suitable thresholds. Additionally, we consider HMMer's log-odds scoring and SAM's original Z-scoring method. Among the null model choices, a simple looping null model that emits characters according to the geometric mean of the character probabilities in the columns modeled by the hidden Markov model (HMM) performs well or best across all four discrimination experiments."

The algorithm maximizes the inner product of two matrices, one of which is the desired \u2018pairing matrix \u2019 and the other a \u2018proximity matrix \u2019 with elements exp (\u2013 r2ij/2\u03c32), where rij is the distance between two features, one in each image, and \u03c3 is an adjustable scale parameter. The output of the algorithm may be compared with the movements that people perceive when viewing two images in quick succession, and it is found that an increase in \u03c3 affects the computed correspondences in much the same way as an increase in interstimulus interval alters the perceived displacements. Provided that \u03c3 is not too small the algorithm will recover the feature mappings that result from image translation, expansion or shear deformation \u2013 transformations of common occurrence in image sequences \u2013 even when the displacements of individual features depart slightly from the general trend."

                "text": "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201cElementary Supernova\u201d model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric times in SN optical spectra."

The input provided to an off-line handwriting recognition system is an image of a digit, a word, or more generally some text, and the system produces, as output, an ASCII transcription of the input. This task involves a number of processing steps, some of which are quite difficult. Typically, preprocessing, normalization, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing operations are required. In this article we survey the state of the art, analyze recent trends, and try to identify challenges for future research in this field."
