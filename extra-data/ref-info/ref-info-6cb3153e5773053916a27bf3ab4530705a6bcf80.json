Extensive testing shows that the suggested scheme outperforms the latest published algorithms. Its simplicity allows the algorithm to detect texts in many fonts and languages."

                "text": "Text in scene images can provide very useful as well as vital information and hence, its detection and recognition is an important task. We propose an adaptive edge-based connected-component method for text-detection in natural scene images. The approach is based on three reasonable assumptions - (i) characters of a particular word are locally aligned in a certain direction (ii) each character is of uniform color ( iii) stroke width is almost constant for most of the characters in a particular word. We apply color quantization and use the luminance to obtain the intensity values. An improved edge-detection technique that performs adaptive thresholding is used to capture all possible text components with some non-text components initially. Then, we remove obvious non-text component based on a few heuristics. Further, we classify those components as text for which we successfully obtain two consecutive nearest-neighbors that are aligned in a direction and satisfy certain constraints based on size and inter component distance. Finally, we estimate stroke width and foreground color for each component and those having a fairly uniform value of the same are classified as text. Results on ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition data show that the method is competitive for text-detection. The main advantage of our method is that it is robust to font-size, degraded intensities and complex backgrounds. Also, the use of stroke width and color in this manner for text detection is novel to the best of the authorpsilas knowledge."

Unlike many other approaches which assume that text is horizontally-oriented, our method is able to handle text of arbitrary orientation. The input image is first filtered with Fourier-Laplacian. K-means clustering is then used to identify candidate text regions based on the maximum difference. The skeleton of each connected component helps to separate the different text strings from each other. Finally, text string straightness and edge density are used for false positive elimination. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to handle graphics text and scene text of both horizontal and nonhorizontal orientation."

Our approach puts very few constraints on the font, size and color of text and is capable of handling both scene text and artificial text well. In this paper, we exploit two well-known features of text: approximately constant stroke width and local contrast, and develop a fast, simple, and effective algorithm to detect character strokes. We also show how these can be used for accurate extraction and motivate some advantages of using this approach for text localization over other color-space segmentation based approaches. We analyze the performance of our stroke detection algorithm on images collected for the robust-reading competitions at ICDAR 2003."

For instance, in an urban context, the detection is very difficult due to large variations in terms of shape, size, color, orientation, and the image may be blurred or have irregular illumination, etc. In this paper, we describe a robust and accurate multiresolution approach to detect and classify text regions in such scenarios. Based on generation/validation paradigm, we first segment images to detect character regions with a multiresolution algorithm able to manage large character size variations. The segmented regions are then filtered out using shapebased classification, and neighboring characters are merged to generate text hypotheses. A validation step computes a region signature based on texture analysis to reject false positives. We evaluate our algorithm in two challenging databases, achieving very good results."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

This method is used in the French iTowns project (iTowns ANR project, 2008) to automatically enhance cartographic database by extracting text from geolocalized pictures of town streets. This task is difficult as 1. text in this environment varies in shape, size, color, orientation... 2. pictures may be blurred, as they are taken from a moving vehicle, and text may have perspective deformations, 3. all pictures are taken outside with various objects that can lead to false positives and in unconstrained conditions (especially light varies from one picture to the other). Then, we can not make the assumption on searched text. The only supposition is that text is not handwritten. Our process is based on two main steps: a new segmentation method based on morphological operator and a classification step based on a combination of multiple SVM classifiers. The description of our process is given in this article. The efficiency of each step is measured and the global scheme is illustrated on an example."

Both text and compressed features are sent to a server. On the server, the title text is used for on-line search and the features are used for image-based comparison. The proposed system is capable of web-scale document retrieval using title text without the need of constructing a document image database. Using features for image-based comparison, we can reliably match retrieved documents to the query document.

For this we used the same data as the ICDAR 2003 competition, which has been kept private until now. This allows a direct comparison with the 2003 entries. The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."

Digital cameras attached to cellular phones, PDAs, or wearable computers, and standalone image or video devices are highly mobile and easy to use; they can capture images of thick books, historical manuscripts too fragile to touch, and text in scenes, making them much more versatile than desktop scanners. Should robust solutions to the analysis of documents captured with such devices become available, there will clearly be a demand in many domains. Traditional scanner-based document analysis techniques provide us with a good reference and starting point, but they cannot be used directly on camera-captured images. Camera-captured images can suffer from low resolution, blur, and perspective distortion, as well as complex layout and interaction of the content and background. In this paper we present a survey of application domains, technical challenges, and solutions for the analysis of documents captured by digital cameras. We begin by describing typical imaging devices and the imaging process. We discuss document analysis from a single camera-captured image as well as multiple frames and highlight some sample applications under development and feasible ideas for future development."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

Transmission and storage of these descriptors are of critical importance in the context of mobile distributed camera networks and large indexing problems. We propose a framework for computing low bit-rate feature descriptors with a 20\u00d7 reduction in bit rate. The framework is low complexity and has significant speed-up in the matching stage. We represent gradient histograms as tree structures which can be efficiently compressed. We show how to efficiently compute distances between descriptors in their compressed representation eliminating the need for decoding. We perform a comprehensive performance comparison with SIFT, SURF, and other low bit-rate descriptors and show that our proposed CHoG descriptor outperforms existing schemes."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

But existing design criteria for cascades either ignore the time complexity of the tests or make over-simplified assumptions about them. This paper gives a criterion for designing a time-efficient cascade that explicitly takes into account the time complexity of tests (as evaluated by computer run time) including the time for pre-processing. We design a greedy algorithm to minimize this criterion (noting that the full problem is NP-complete). Finally, we illustrate our method on the task of text detection in city scenes. This gives a text detection algorithm that runs at 0.025 seconds per 320\u00d7240 image, which is equivalent to 40 frames per second. This is a speed up factor of 2.5 compared to our previous text detector. It gives a realtime system which can be used for applications to help the blind and visually impaired."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

The inverted index can require gigabytes of memory, which significantly slows down the database server. In this paper, we design, develop, and compare techniques for inverted index compression for image-based retrieval. We show that these techniques significantly reduce memory usage, by as much as 5x, without loss in recognition accuracy. Our work includes fast decoding methods, an offline database reordering scheme that exploits the similarity between images for additional memory savings, and a generalized coding scheme for soft-binned feature descriptor histograms. We also show that reduced index memory permits memory-intensive image matching techniques that boost recognition accuracy."

The product is recognized by an image-based retrieval system located on a remote server. Our database currently comprises more than one million entries, primarily products packaged in rigid boxes with printed labels, such as CDs, DVDs, and books. We extract low bit-rate descriptors from the query image and compress the location of the descriptors using location histogram coding on the camera-phone. We transmit the compressed query features, instead of a query image, to reduce the transmission delay. We use inverted index compression and fast geometric re-ranking on our database to provide a low delay image recognition response for large scale databases. Experimental timing results on different parts of the mobile product recognition system is reported in this work."

The standard algorithm makes use of a union-find data structure and takes quasi-linear time in the number of pixels. The new algorithm provides exactly identical results in true worst-case linear time. Moreover, the new algorithm uses significantly less memory and has better cache-locality, resulting in faster execution. Our CPU implementation performs twice as fast as a state-of-the-art FPGA implementation based on the standard algorithm. \n \nThe new algorithm is based on a different computational ordering of the pixels, which is suggested by another immersion analogy than the one corresponding to the standard connected-component algorithm. With the new computational ordering, the pixels considered or visited at any point during computation consist of a single connected component of pixels in the image, resembling a flood-fill that adapts to the grey-level landscape. The computation only needs a priority queue of candidate pixels (the boundary of the single connected component), a single bit image masking visited pixels, and information for as many components as there are grey-levels in the image. This is substantially more compact in practice than the standard algorithm, where a large number of connected components must be considered in parallel. The new algorithm can also generate the component tree of the image in true linear time.

We avoid network latency by implementing the algorithm on the phone and deliver excellent performance by adapting a state-of-the-art image retrieval algorithm based on robust local descriptors. Matching is performed against a database of highly relevant features, which is continuously updated to reflect changes in the environment. We achieve fast updates and scalability by pruning of irrelevant features based on proximity to the user. By compressing and incrementally updating the features stored on the phone we make the system amenable to low-bandwidth wireless connections. We demonstrate system robustness on a dataset of location-tagged images and show a smart-phone implementation that achieves a high image matching rate while operating in near real-time."

For ease of computation, a commonly used approximate algorithm is the chamfer distance transform. This paper presents an efficient linear- time algorithm for calculating the true Euclidean distance-squared of each point from the nearest boundary. It works by performing a 1D distance transform on each row of the image, and then combines the results in each column. It is shown that the Euclidean distance squared transform requires fewer computations than the commonly used 5x5 chamfer transform."

In this paper, we design and implement a mobile book recognition system for conveniently generating an inventory of books by snapping photos of a bookshelf with a smartphone. Since smartphones are becoming ubiquitous and affordable, our inventory management solution is cost-effective and very easy to deploy. Automatic and robust book recognition is achieved in our system using a combination of spine segmentation and bag-of-features image matching. At the same time, the location of each book is inferred from the smartphone's sensor readings, including accelerometer traces, digital compass measurements, and WiFi signatures. This location information is combined with the image recognition results to construct a location-aware book inventory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our book spine recognition and location estimation techniques in recognition experiments and in an actual mobile book recognition system."
