In this work we propose a language-independent NER system that uses automatically learned features only. Our approach is based on the CharWNN deep neural network, which uses word-level and character-level representations (embeddings) to perform sequential classification. We perform an extensive number of experiments using two annotated corpora in two different languages: HAREM I corpus, which contains texts in Portuguese; and the SPA CoNLL-2002 corpus, which contains texts in Spanish. Our experimental results shade light on the contribution of neural character embeddings for NER. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same neural network which has been successfully applied to POS tagging can also achieve state-of-the-art results for language-independet NER, using the same hyperparameters, and without any handcrafted features. For the HAREM I corpus, CharWNN outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 7.9 points in the F1-score for the total scenario (ten NE classes), and by 7.2 points in the F1 for the selective scenario (five NE classes)."

Our model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway net work over characters, whose output is given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM). On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60% fewer parameters. On languages with rich morphology (Arabic, Czech, French, German, Spanish, Russian), the model outperforms word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with fewer parameters. The results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling. Analysis of word representations obtained from the character composition part of the model reveals that the model is able to encode, from characters only, both semantic and orthographic information.\n \n"

In this paper we present two contributions: a new form of learning word embeddings that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve the representations, and the first system to use neural word embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art results on named-entity recognition in both CoNLL and Ontonotes NER. Our system achieves an F1 score of 90.90 on the test set for CoNLL 2003---significantly better than any previous system trained on public data, and matching a system employing massive private industrial query-log data."

                "text": "As described by Zipf\u2019s law, vast proportions of words in most natural languages occur very infrequently, meaning that in a statistical learning framework these words would be poorly modelled for any given corpus of practical, finite size. This is known as the rare word problem. This is often worsened by the implementation of neural networks, since neural networks make use of softmax functions in the output layer. Evaluating these functions for each word in the vocabulary becomes computationally expensive in both training and runtime, as the normalisation constant is a summation of exponentials in the order O(|V|), where V is the output vocabulary. A simple method to counteract this is to label rare and infrequent words in the training corpus as an unknown word token, thereby limiting the size of the vocabulary. Nevertheless, doing so only worsens the fact that, for a given translation corpus, the vocabulary may not include all words in the natural languages involved. This is an issue in agglutinative languages, where unseen, legitimate words can be formed from known constituent words, making them di cult to model. This is known as the unknown word problem. We attempt to implement LSTM recurrent neural network language models based on Zaremba et al. (2014) for rescoring in the Syntactical-Guided Neural Machine Translation system by Stahlberg et al. (2016). Further, we compare methods to compress the vocabulary of a language through certain coding schemes, in order to reduce the impact of the computationally expensive softmax layer, and investigate there are better ways to represent natural language in neural network structures other than using tokens on the word level. Previous work have focused on word encodings for end-to-end translation systems, while we primarily focus on the more general application of language modelling. We implement byte-pair encoding, Hu\u21b5man coding and character decomposition, and compare their performance in a SMT setting to a truncated vocabulary that is standard for neural network language models. We find that BPE is better than character-level decomposition as it is more e cient, especially for the most frequent words, and it gives higher BLEU scores than Hu\u21b5man coding and is able to decompose new words in the language. We also show that by using byte-pair encoding we can improve the BLEU score performance for SMT systems over that of a truncated vocabulary, investigating whether this is due to the e cient decomposition or the enlarged vocabulary."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1,2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus."

Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."

These models include LSTM networks, bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM) networks, LSTM with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (LSTM-CRF) and bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer (BI-LSTM-CRF). Our work is the first to apply a bidirectional LSTM CRF (denoted as BI-LSTM-CRF) model to NLP benchmark sequence tagging data sets. We show that the BI-LSTM-CRF model can efficiently use both past and future input features thanks to a bidirectional LSTM component. It can also use sentence level tag information thanks to a CRF layer. The BI-LSTM-CRF model can produce state of the art (or close to) accuracy on POS, chunking and NER data sets. In addition, it is robust and has less dependence on word embedding as compared to previous observations."

Phonemisation dictionaries and language model based decoding techniques are applied to transform the phoneme hypothesis into orthographic transcriptions. Direct modelling of graphemes as sub-word units using HMM has not been successful. We investigate a novel ASR approach using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and Connectionist Temporal Classification, which is capable of transcribing graphemes directly and yields results highly competitive with phoneme transcription. In design of such a grapheme based speech recognition system phonemisation dictionaries are no longer required. All that is needed is text transcribed on the sentence level, which greatly simplifies the training procedure. The novel approach is evaluated extensively on the Wall Street Journal 1 corpus."

The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a language model in NLP. The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predicts the input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a \"pretraining\" algorithm for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, the parameters obtained from the pretraining step can then be used as a starting point for other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long short term memory recurrent networks after pretrained with the two approaches become more stable to train and generalize better. With pretraining, we were able to achieve strong performance in many classification tasks, such as text classification with IMDB, DBpedia or image recognition in CIFAR-10."

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

Unlike traditional DNN-HMM models, this model learns all the components of a speech recognizer jointly. Our system has two components: a listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal recurrent network encoder that accepts filter bank spectra as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs. The network produces character sequences without making any independence assumptions between the characters. This is the key improvement of LAS over previous end-to-end CTC models. On a subset of the Google voice search task, LAS achieves a word error rate (WER) of 14.1% without a dictionary or a language model, and 10.3% with language model rescoring over the top 32 beams. By comparison, the state-of-the-art CLDNN-HMM model achieves a WER of 8.0%."

The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. A modification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expectation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%."

On clean inputs, such as the Canadian Hansards, these methods have been very successful (at least 96% correct by sentence). Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find paragraph boundaries, let alone sentences.

I suggest that it must still be possible to greatly increase tagging performance and examine some useful improvements that have recently been made to the Stanford Part-of-Speech Tagger. However, an error analysis of some of the remaining errors suggests that there is limited further mileage to be had either from better machine learning or better features in a discriminative sequence classifier. The prospects for further gains from semisupervised learning also seem quite limited. Rather, I suggest and begin to demonstrate that the largest opportunity for further progress comes from improving the taxonomic basis of the linguistic resources from which taggers are trained. That is, from improved descriptive linguistics. However, I conclude by suggesting that there are also limits to this process. The status of some words may not be able to be adequately captured by assigning them to one of a small number of categories. While conventions can be used in such cases to improve tagging consistency, they lack a strong linguistic basis."

The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements. Moreover, it was used succesfully in our winning entry to the MSCOCO image captioning challenge, 2015."

To demonstrate the effectiveness and language independence of our approach, we present experimental results on Greek, English, and Chinese data. We show that our approach achieves state of the art performance in each of these cases. In particular, we obtain a 18% accuracy improvement over the best published results for a Greek data set, while using a far simpler technique than previous investigations."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting."

Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this di cult learning problem. Answering these questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization, the positive e ect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a regularizer. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples."

                "text": "Source code author identification deals with the task of identifying the most likely author of a computer program, given a set of predefined author candidates. This is usually .based on the analysis of other program samples of undisputed authorship by the same programmer. There are several cases where the application of such a method could be of a major benefit, such as authorship disputes, proof of authorship in court, tracing the source of code left in the system after a cyber attack, etc. We present a new approach, called the SCAP (Source Code Author Profiles) approach, based on byte-level n-gram profiles in order to represent a source code author's style. Experiments on data sets of different programming-language (Java or C++) and varying difficulty (6 to 30 candidate authors) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.A comparison with a previous source code authorship identification study based on more complicated information shows that the SCAP approach is language independent and that n-gram author profiles are better able to capture the idiosyncrasies of the source code authors. Moreover, the SCAP approach is able to deal surprisingly well with cases where only a limited amount of very short programs per programmer is available for training. It is also demonstrated that the effectiveness of the proposed model is not affected by the absence of comments in the source code, a condition usually met in cyber-crime cases."
