In general, a representation is n ot unique and there may be different weighted transducers real izing the same mapping. In particular, even when they have exactly the same topology with the same input and output labels , two equivalent transducers may differ by the way the weights are distributed along each path. We present aweight pushingalgorithm that modifies the weights of a given weighted transducer in a way such that the transition probabilities form a stochastic distribution. This results in an equivalent transducer whose weight distributio n is more suitable for pruning and speech recognition. We demonstrate substantial improvements of the speed of our recogni ti n system in several tasks based on the use of this algorithm. We report a45% speedup at83% word accuracy with a simple single-pass40; 000-word vocabulary North American Business News (NAB) recognition system on the DARPA Eval \u201995 test set. With the same technique, we report a 550% speedup at 88% word accuracy in rescoring NAB word lattices with more accurate 2nd-pass models. We finally report a 280% speedup at 68% word accuracy for100; 000 first name-last name pairs recognition."

We show that an efficient recognition network including context-dependent and HMM models can be built using weighted determinization of transducers [6]. We report experiments with a 463,331-word vocabulary North American Business News Task that show a substantial improvement of the recognition speed over our previous method [9].

In particular, speech understanding applications require appropriate grammars both to constrain speech recognition and to help extract the meaning of utterances. In many of those applications, the actual languages described are regular, but context-free representations are much more concise and easier to create. We describe an efficient algorithm for compiling into weighted finite automata an interesting class of weighted context-free grammars that represent regular languages. The resulting automata can then be combined with other speech recognition components. Our method allows the recognizer to dynamically activate or deactivate grammar rules and substitute a new regular language for some terminal symbols, depending on previously recognized inputs, all without recompilation. We also report experimental results showing the practicality of the approach."

                "text": "Context-dependent rewrite rules are used in many areas of natural language and speech processing. Work in computational phonology has demonstrated that, given certain conditions, such rewrite rules can be represented as nite-state transducers (FSTs). We describe a new algorithm for compiling rewrite rules into FSTs. We show the algorithm to be simpler and more eecient than existing algorithms. Further, many of our applications demand the ability to compile weighted rules into weighted FSTs, transducers generalized by providing transitions with weights. We have extended the algorithm to allow for this. 1. Motivation Rewrite rules are used in many areas of natural language and speech processing, including syntax, morphology, and phonology 1. In interesting applications , the number of rules can be very large. It is then crucial to give a representation of these rules that leads to eecient programs. Finite-state transducers provide just such a compact representation (Mohri, 1994). They are used in various areas of natural language and speech processing because their increased computational power enables one to build very large machines to model interestingly complex linguistic phenomena. They also allow algebraic operations such as union, composition, and projection which are very useful in practice (Berstel, 1979; Eilen-berg, 1974 1976). And, as originally shown by Johnson (1972), rewrite rules can be modeled as 1 Parallel rewrite rules also have interesting applications in biology. In addition to their formal language theory interest, systems such as those of Aristid Lin-denmayer provide rich mathematical models for biological development (Rozenberg and Salomaa, 1980). nite-state transducers, under the condition that no rule be allowed to apply any more than a nite number of times to its own output. Kaplan and Kay (1994), or equivalently Kart-tunen (1995), provide an algorithm for compiling rewrite rules into nite-state transducers, under the condition that they do not rewrite their non-contextual part 2. We here present a new algorithm for compiling such rewrite rules which is both simpler to understand and implement, and computa-tionally more eecient. Clarity is important since, as pointed out by Kaplan and Kay (1994), the representation of rewrite rules by nite-state transducers involves many subtleties. Time and space eeciency of the compilation are also crucial. Using naive algorithms can be very time consuming and lead to very large machines (Liberman, 1994). In some applications such as those related to speech processing, one needs to use weighted rewrite rules, namely rewrite rules to which weights are associated. \u2026"

While fully-expanded networks have been used before in restrictive settings (medium vocabulary or no cross-word contexts), we demonstrate that our network determination method makes it practical to use fully-expanded networks also in large-vocabulary recognition with full cross-word context modeling. For the DARPA North American Business News task (NAB), we give network sizes and recognition speeds and accuracies using bigram and trigram grammars with vocabulary sizes ranging from 10000 to 160000 words. With our construction, the fully-expanded NAB context-dependent networks contain only about twice as many arcs as the corresponding language models. Interestingly, we also find that, with these networks, real-time word accuracy is improved by increasing the vocabulary size and n-gram order."

In particular, a single automata join algorithm can be used either to combine information sources such as a pronunciation dictionary and a context-dependency model during the construction of a decoder, or dynamically during the operation of the decoder. Applications to speech recognition and to Chinese text segmentation will be discussed."

The contributing authors comprise an impressive collection -- essentially the originating sources for much of the important recent work in this area.\" \n-- Philip Resnik, Assistant Professor, Department of Linguistics and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland at College Park Finite-state devices, which include finite-state automata, graphs, and finite-state transducers, are in wide use in many areas of computer science. Recently, there has been a resurgence of the use of finite-state devices in all aspects of computational linguistics, including dictionary encoding, text processing, and speech processing. This book describes the fundamental properties of finite-state devices and illustrates their uses. Many of the contributors pioneered the use of finite-automata for different aspects of natural language processing. The topics, which range from the theoretical to the applied, include finite-state morphology, approximation of phrase-structure grammars, deterministic part-of-speech tagging, application of a finite-state intersection grammar, a finite-state transducer for extracting information from text, and speech recognition using weighted finite automata. The introduction presents the basic theoretical results in finite-state automata and transducers. These results and algorithms are described and illustrated with simple formal language examples as well as natural language examples. \nContributors: Douglas Appelt, John Bear, David Clemenceau, Maurice Gross, Jerry R.

The selected units are chosen to minimize a combination of target and join costs for a given sentence. However, the join costs, in particular, can be quite expensive to compute, even when this computation has been optimized. If possible, we would avoid this computation by precomputing and caching all the possible join costs, but their number is prohibitive. Although the search space of possible joins is large, we have found that only a small fraction are selected in practice. By synthesizing a large quantity of text and logging the units actually selected, we were able to gather usage statistics and construct a practical and efficient cache of concatenation costs. Use of this cache dramatically decreased the runtime of the AT&T Next-Generation TTS system [1] with negligible effect on speech quality. Experiments show that by caching 0.7% of the possible joins, 99% of the join cost computations can be avoided."

This so-called language model look-ahead is built into the time-synchronous beam search algorithm using a tree-organized pronunciation lexicon for a bigram language model. The language model look-ahead technique exploits the full knowledge of the bigram language model by distributing the language model probabilities over the nodes of the lexical tree for each predecessor word. We present a method for handling the resulting memory requirements. The recognition experiments performed on the 20,000-word North American Business task (Nov. 1996) demonstrate that, in comparison with the unigram look-ahead, a reduction by a factor of 5 in the acoustic search effort can be achieved without loss in recognition accuracy."

However, standard speech recognition frameworks are based on the substitution of lowerlevel models for higher-level units. Since substitution cannot express context-dependency constraints, actual recognizers use restrictive model-structure assumptions and specialized code for context-dependent models, leading to decreased flexibility and lost opportunities for automatic model optimization. Instead, we propose a recognition framework that builds in the possibility of context dependency from the start by using weighted finite-state transduction rather than substitution. The framework is implemented with a general demand-driven transducer composition algorithm that allows great flexibility in model structure, form of context dependency and network expansion method, while achieving competitive recognition performance."

The resulting grammar contains at most one new nonterminal for any nonterminal symbol of the input grammar. The result thus remains readable and if necessary modifiable. We extend the approximation algorithm to the case of weighted context-free grammars. We also report experiments with several grammars showing that the size of the minimal deterministic automata accepting the resulting approximations is of practical use for applications such as speech recognition."

The system implements a \"voting\" or rescoring process to reconcile differences in ASR system outputs. We refer to this system as the NIST Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER) system. As additional knowledge sources are added to an ASR system (e.g. acoustic and language models), error rates are typically decreased. This paper describes a post-recognition process which models the output generated by multiple ASR systems as independent knowledge sources that can be combined and used to generate an output with reduced error rate. To accomplish this, the outputs of multiple of ASR systems are combined into a single, minimal-cost word transition network (WTN) via iterative applications of dynamic programming (DP) alignments. The resulting network is searched by an automatic rescoring or \"voting\" process that selects the output sequence with the lowest score."

                "text": "Abstract A method of speaker adaptation for continuous density hidden Markov models (HMMs) is presented. An initial speaker-independent system is adapted to improve the modelling of a new speaker by updating the HMM parameters. Statistics are gathered from the available adaptation data and used to calculate a linear regression-based transformation for the mean vectors. The transformation matrices are calculated to maximize the likelihood of the adaptation data and can be implemented using the forward\u2013backward algorithm. By tying the transformations among a number of distributions, adaptation can be performed for distributions which are not represented in the training data. An important feature of the method is that arbitrary adaptation data can be used\u2014no special enrolment sentences are needed. Experiments have been performed on the ARPA RM1 database using an HMM system with cross-word triphones and mixture Gaussian output distributions. Results show that adaptation can be performed using as little as 11 s of adaptation data, and that as more data is used the adaptation performance improves. For example, using 40 adaptation utterances, a 37% reduction in error from the speaker-independent system was achieved with supervised adaptation and a 32% reduction in unsupervised mode."

Our method is closely related to previous lattice generation met hods, but applies to more general network topologies. We also give real-time results on the NAB task, in which we generate lattices in a first pass and then rescore them with stronger acoustic and language models in a second pass. We are able to achieve at 3x real-time a word error rate of 11.2% on the Eval \u201995 test set, which is only 1.7% worse than AT&T\u2019s official benchmark result that year using what was then a 1000x real-time system."

Generally, the elimination of n-grams with very low counts is believed to not significantly affect model performance. This project investigates the degradation of a trigram backoff model's perplexity and word error rates as bigram and trigram cutoffs are increased. The advantage of reduction in model size is compared to the increase in word error rate and perplexity scores. More importantly, this project also investigates alternative ways of excluding bigrams and trigrams from a backoff language model, using criteria other than the number of times an n-gram occurs in the training text. Specifically, a difference method has been investigated where the difference in the logs of the original and backed off trigram and bigram probabilities is used as a basis for n-gram exclusion from the model. We show that excluding trigrams and bigrams based on a weighted version of this difference method results in better perplexity and word error rate performance than excluding trigrams and bigrams based on counts alone."

It may, occasionally be also somewhat elliptic. The ideas are presented in a most economical fashion and the author does expect the reader to be able to fill in the more obvious details. This permits him to present the leading ideas in an uncluttered way. Finally, while the ultimate verdict on the work, like everything human, belongs to history, those of us, who were fortunate enough to have known Harold Davenport, cannot help remembering also the man. While much of what he was-cultured, articulate, logical-is indeed reflected in his work, not everything is. He was generous with his time and enjoyed (or at least seemed to enjoy) showing Cambridge to his guests. While, to judge by his students, his standards must have been very high, he was quite patient with the more common brand of mankind and made genuine efforts to make himself understood by the less sophisticated reader (see, e.g., his book \"The Higher Arithmetic\"). In fact, this reviewer can recall only one outburst of impatience (or indignation?) of Davenport: it was with mathematicians who claim results, but never publish their proofs, either because they don't have any, or in order to keep their methods as private property of a small group of close collaborators. No names were named. The reviewer wants to take this opportunity to thank Professor D. J. Lewis for a very helpful letter concerning Davenport which confirmed many and completed some of the reviewer's own recollections. In the early sixties, stimulated by the discoveries of M. P. Sch\u00fbtzenberger, a number of researchers at the University of Paris contributed to a new"

This first handbook of formal languages gives a comprehensive up-to-date coverage of all important aspects and subareas of the field. Best specialists of various subareas, altogether 50 in number, are among the authors. The maturity of the field makes it possible to include a historical perspective in many presentations. The individual chapters can be studied independently, both as a text and as a source of reference. The Handbook is an invaluable aid for advanced students and specialists in theoretical computer science and related areas in mathematics, linguistics, and biology."
