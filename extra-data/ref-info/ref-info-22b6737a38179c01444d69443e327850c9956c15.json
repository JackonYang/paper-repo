The information utilized by the decoder consists of a syntax, a lexicon containing transcription variation for each word, and performance-based statistics from acoustic analysis. The latter contain information related to automatic segmentation and classification accuracy and certainty (anchor-point) data. A distinction is made between speaker- and machine-dependent corruption of phonetic input strings. Preliminary results are presented and discussed, together with some considerations for evaluation."

The error correction procedure can best be described as a sequential decoding on the tree of syntax generated by the tables, as traversed by a syntactical parser.

Practical problems connected with implementing the stack algorithm are discussed and a scheme is described that facilitates satisfactory performance even with limited stack storage capacity.
