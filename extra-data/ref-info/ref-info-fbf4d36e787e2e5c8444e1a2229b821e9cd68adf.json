The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general."

                "text": "This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

This approach has been successfully used in industrial machine vision, but it is not capable of dealing with the complexities of recognizing classes of similar objects. This paper undertakes this task by proposing and testing a component-based methodology encompassing three main ingredients: 1) a new way of learning and extracting shape-class components from surface shape information; 2) a new shape representation called a symbolic surface signature that summarizes the geometric relationships among components; and 3) an abstract representation of shape classes formed by a hierarchy of classifiers that learn object-class parts and their spatial relationships from examples."

The dissimilarity between the target model (its color distribution) and the target candidates is expressed by a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient. The theoretical analysis of the approach shows that it relates to the Bayesian framework while providing a practical, fast and efficient solution. The capability of the tracker to handle in real time partial occlusions, significant clutter, and target scale variations, is demonstrated for several image sequences."

This new second edition of Practical C++ Programming is a complete introduction to the C++ language for programmers who are learning C++. Reflecting the latest changes to the C++ standard, this new edition takes a practical down-to-earth approach, placing a strong emphasis on how to design clean, useful code. In short, to-the-point chapters, all aspects of programming are covered, including style, software engineering, programming design, object-oriented design, and debugging. The book also covers common mistakes and how to find (and avoid) them. End-of-chapter exercises help you ensure that you've mastered the material."

Few students studying computer science or computer engineering will ever have the opportunity to build a computer system. On the other hand, most students will be required to use and program computers on a near daily basis. Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective introduces the important and enduring concepts that underlie computer systems by showing how these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of application programs. The text's hands-on approach (including a comprehensive set of labs) helps students understand the under-the-hood operation of a modern computer system and prepares them for future courses in systems topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, and networking.Visit the CSS:AP web page http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu for more information and resources."

We review a range of Java benchmark programs, including those collected by the Java Grande Forum as useful performance indicators for large-scale scientific applications, or \u201cJava Grande applications\u201d. We systematically analyse these benchmarks on a collection of compute platforms including Pentium II, UltraSPARC II, Silicon Graphics, iMac and Alpha, and operating systems including Windows NT, Solaris, and Linux, and consider differences in performance between benchmarks running on the Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 1.1.6 and 1.2. We also analyse some benchmark programs we have developed to augment existing collections. We observe some general trends in the performance of Java on various platforms and also conduct some comparisons between benchmarks written in Java and in traditional languages such as C and Fortran. We discuss performance variations across systems and the implications of Java systems performance for those developing scientific applications."
