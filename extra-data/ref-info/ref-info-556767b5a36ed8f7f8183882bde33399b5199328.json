The model takes occlusions into account, and produces images that show translational invariance, and approximate scale invariance under block averaging and median ltering. We compare the statistics of the simulated images with data from natural scenes, and nd good agreement for short-range and middle-range statistics. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of the model on a 3D description of the world."

First, the marginal densities of the coefficients have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint densities exhibit variance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We examine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show that these densities can accurately characterize both the marginal and joint distributions of natural image wavelet coefficients. This class of model suggests a Markov structure, in which wavelet coefficients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding to local image structure. We derive an estimator for these hidden variables, and show that a nonlinear \"normalization\" procedure can be used to Gaussianize the coefficients."

Their statistics are important not only in image compression but also for the study of sensory processing in biology, which can be viewed as satisfying certain \u2018design criteria\u2019. This review summarizes previous work on image statistics and presents our own data. Perhaps the most notable property of natural images is an invariance to scale. We present data to support this claim as well as evidence for a hierarchical invariance in natural scenes. These symmetries provide a powerful description of natural images as they greatly restrict the class of allowed distributions."

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

                "text": "We develop a probability model for natural images, based on empirical observation of their statistics in the wavelet transform domain. Pairs of wavelet coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature."

B. Julesz (1981) introduced the term texton, analogous to a phoneme in speech recognition, but did not provide an operational definition for gray-level images. We re-invent textons as frequently co-occurring combinations of oriented linear filter outputs. These can be learned using a K-means approach. By mapping each pixel to its nearest texton, the image can be analyzed into texton channels, each of which is a point set where discrete techniques such as Voronoi diagrams become applicable. Local histograms of texton frequencies can be used with a /spl chi//sup 2/ test for significant differences to find texture boundaries. Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so we combine this cue with that of the presence of peaks of contour energy derived from outputs of odd- and even-symmetric oriented Gaussian derivative filters. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on a statistical test for isotropy of Delaunay neighbors. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

To apply these techniques, one needs, of course, a probabilistic model for some class of images or some class of structures present in images. Many models of this type have been introduced. There are stochastic models for image textures [GGGD], [ZMW], for contours in images [Mu], [GCK], for the decomposition of an image into regions [G-G], [M-S], for disparity maps, for grammatical parsing of shapes [Fu], for template matching, for speci c tasks such as face recognition [HGYGM]. The common framework for all these studies is to describe some class of images I(x; y) by means of a set of auxiliary variables fx g representing the salient structures in the images, e.g. edges, texture statistics, inferred depth values or relations, illumination features, medial axes or shape features, locations of key points such as eyes in a face, labels (as in character recognition), etc. Then i) a prior probability model for the `hidden' variables p(fx g) and ii) an imagingmodel p(Ijfx g) for I, given the hidden variables, are de ned. Finally, an image is analyzed using Bayes's rule p(fx gjI) / p(Ijfx g)p(fx g)"

Both paradigms pose clutter modeling as a statistical inference problem, and pursue probabilistic models for characterizing observed training images. The two paradigms differ in the forms (or families) of models that they choose and in their philosophical assumptions on real world clutter patterns. The first paradigm studies descriptive models, such as Markov random field (MRF) models and the minimax entropy models (Zhu, Wu, and Mumford 1997). In this modeling paradigm, image features are first extracted from images, and statistics of these features are calculated. The latter define an image ensemble-called the Julesz ensemble which is an equivalence class where all images share the same feature statistics. For any large images from this ensemble, a local patch given its boundary condition is then Gibbs (or MRF) models. We shall review the recent conclusions about ensemble equivalence studied in (Wu, Zhu and Liu, 1999). The second paradigm studies generative model, such as the random collage model (Lee and Mumford, 1999). In contrast to a descriptive model, a generative model introduces hidden variables which are assumed to be the underlying causes producing the observed image. For example, trees and rock for clutter. The learning process makes inference about the hidden variables. We shall discuss a texton model for clutter and effective Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for stochastic inference. We shall also reveal the deep relationship between the two modeling paradigm."

To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

However, image processing practice has shown that universal thresholding methods are outperformed by simple Bayesian estimators assuming independent wavelet coefficients and heavy-tailed priors such as generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs). In this paper, we investigate various connections between shrinkage methods and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using such priors. In particular, we state a simple condition under which MAP estimates are sparse. We also introduce a new family of complexity priors based upon Rissanen's universal prior on integers. One particular estimator in this class outperforms conventional estimators based on earlier applications of the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We develop analytical expressions for the shrinkage rules implied by GGD and complexity priors. This allows us to show the equivalence between universal hard thresholding, MAP estimation using a very heavy-tailed GGD, and MDL estimation using one of the new complexity priors. Theoretical analysis supported by numerous practical experiments shows the robustness of some of these estimates against mis-specifications of the prior-a basic concern in image processing applications."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

However, to facilitate sequential inference (e.g. over time or scale) and to allow the representation of ambiguity, it is desirable to represent an entire probability distribution for object location. Although the cross correlation itself (or some function of it) has sometimes been treated as a probability distribution, this is not generally justifiable. Bayesian correlation achieves a consistent probabilistic treatment by combining several developments. The first is the interpretation of correlation matching functions in probabilistic terms, as observation likelihoods. Second, probability distributions of filter bank responses are learned from training examples. Inescapably, response learning also demands statistical modelling of background intensities, and there are links here with image coding and Independent Component Analysis. Lastly, multi scale processing is achieved in a Bayesian context by means of a new algorithm, layered sampling, for which asymptotic properties are derived."

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features."

For these reasons, we do think that probability models that are physics-based and include structured primitives are practical. The goal of this paper is, however, not to develop tools for any of the applications listed above. Our aim is to study whether a simple version of the dead leaves model can reproduce the empirical statistics of natural images better than any of the other classes which have been studied, e.g. Gaussian models, the \u201cscale mixture of Gaussians model\u201d of Wainwright and Simoncelli (2000), the infinitely divisible models by Mumford and Gidas, and Markov Random Fields."

This paper studies a hybrid class of generative image models which shares some attributes of both classical template-based models and wavelet expansion models. The basic idea behind these so called \u201cdead leaves models\u201d is to assume that the image is formed from a set of template-based elementary objects, whose locations and possibly scale are a sample from a Poisson process, and which partially occlude one another, being laid down in layers. These models were first introduced by Matheron (1968) and Serra (1982) for the morphological analysis of materials, and has only recently been applied to natural image statistics\u2014see, for example, Ruderman (1997) on the origins of power spectrum scaling, and Alvarez et al."
