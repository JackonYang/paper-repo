Detecting rotated faces is a two step procedure. First a \\DeRotation\" network is used to process each input window. If there is a face in the window, this network determines its angle of rotation. Based upon this estimated angle of rotation, the window is then rotated to an upright position. Second, a \\Detection\" network, or multiple detection networks, are used to determine whether the rotated window contained an upright face. The training methods for both networks are presented. Preliminary empirical results are also provided."
