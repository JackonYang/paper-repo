The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general."

We have chosen a functional form of the posterior probability function that captures the joint statistics of local appearance and position on the object as well as the statistics of local appearance in the visual world at large. We use a discrete representation of local appearance consisting of approximately 10/sup 6/ patterns. We compute an estimate of P(object/image) in closed form by counting the frequency of occurrence of these patterns over various sets of training images. We have used this method for detecting human faces from frontal and profile views. The algorithm for frontal views has shown a detection rate of 93.0% with 88 false alarms on a set of 125 images containing 483 faces combining the MIT test set of Sung and Poggio with the CMU test sets of Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade. The algorithm for detection of profile views has also demonstrated promising results."

Though superficially similar to a number of \"Gabor\" style techniques, which recognize textures through the extraction of multi-scale feature vectors, our approach is derived from an accurate generative model of texture, which is explicitly multiscale and non-parametric. The resulting recognition procedure is similarly non-parametric, and can model complex non-homogeneous textures. We report results on publicly available texture databases. In addition, experiments indicate that this approach may have sufficient discrimination power to perform target detection in synthetic aperture radar images (SAR)."

A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location.

This framework can be used to both derive an object recognition algorithm and an algorithm for learning the features themselves. The overall approach, called complex feature recognition or CFR, is unique for several reasons: it is broadly applicable to a wide range of object types, it makes constructing object models easy, it is capable of identifying either the class or the identity of an object, and it is computationally efficient--requiring time proportional to the size of the image. Instead of a single simple feature such as an edge, CFR uses a large set of complex features that are learned from experience with model objects. The response of a single complex feature contains much more class information than does a single edge. This significantly reduces the number of possible correspondences between the model and the image. In addition, CFR takes advantage of a type of image processing called \"oriented energy\". Oriented energy is used to efficiently pre-process the image to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with changes in lighting and pose."

                "text": ". This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This theory combines \ufb01ltering theory and Markov random \ufb01eld modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clari\ufb01es many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a uni\ufb01ed point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f . I / on a random \ufb01eld, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f . I / , given a set of observed texture examples. In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of \ufb01lters is selected from a general \ufb01lter bank to capture features of the texture, these \ufb01lters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the \ufb01ltered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f . I / . This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p . I / , which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p . I / is considered as an estimate of f . I / . This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose \ufb01lters from a general \ufb01lter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random \ufb01elds And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random \ufb01eld (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p . I / , thus the model is veri\ufb01ed by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

The intensity surface of the facial image is modeled as a deformable 3D mesh in (z, y, I(x, y)) space. Using an efficient technique for matching two surfaces (in terms of the analytic modes of vibration), we obtain a dense correspondence field (or 3D warp) between two images. The probability distributions of two classes of warps are then estimated from training data: interpersonal and extrapersonal variations. These densities are then used in a Bayesian framework for image matching and recognition. Experimental results with facial data from the US Army FERET database demonstrate an increased recognition rate over the previous best methods."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

An AAM contains a statistical model of shape and grey level appearance which can generalise to almost any face. Matching to an image involves finding model parameters which minimise the difference between the image and a synthesised face. We observe that displacing each model parameter from the correct value induces a particular pattern in the residuals. In a training phase, the AAM learns a linear model of the correlation between parameter displacements and the induced residuals. During search it measures the residuals and uses this model to correct the current parameters, leading to a better fit. A good overall match is obtained in a few iterations, even from poor starting estimates. We describe the technique in detail and show it matching to new face images."

In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures than do previous techniques."

This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>"

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

It can be used to produce solid textures for creating textured 3-d objects without the distortions inherent in texture mapping. It can also be used to synthesize texture mixtures, images that look a bit like each of several digitized samples. The approach is based on a model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful tool for graphics applications."

We describe the joint distribution between pairs of coefficients at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. Although the raw coefficients are nearly, uncorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. A linear magnitude predictor coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, provides a reasonable description of the conditional probability densities. We use this model to construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bit-plane at a time using a non-adaptive arithmetic encoder. Bit-planes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. We demonstrate the quality of the statistical characterization by comparing rate-distortion curves of the coder to several standard coders."
