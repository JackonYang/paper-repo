For this purpose, the authors use a database of handwritten digits, with relatively uniform handwriting styles. The authors propose a novel way of organizing the network architectures by training several small networks so as to deal separately with subsets of the problem, and then combining the results. This approach works in conjunction with various techniques including: layered networks with one or several layers of adaptive connections, fully connected recursive networks, ad hoc networks with no adaptive connections, and architectures with second-degree polynomial decision surfaces.<<ETX>>"

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

The effect of boosting is reported on four handwritten image databases consisting of 12000 digits from segmented ZIP Codes from the United States Postal Service and the following from the National Institute of Standards and Technology: 220000 digits, 45000 upper case letters, and 45000 lower case letters. We use two performance measures: the raw error rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required to achieve a 1% error rate on the patterns not rejected. Boosting improved performance significantly, and, in some cases, dramatically."

It is somewhat surprising that a very good single-character recognizer does not in general form a good basis for a multi-character recognizer. The correct solution depends on three key ideas: 1) A method for normalizing probabilities correctly, to preserve information on the quality of the segmentation; 2) A method for giving credit for multiple segmentations that assign the same interpretation to the image; and 3) A method that combines recognition and segmentation into a single adaptive process, trained to maximize the score of the right answer. We also discuss improved ways of analyzing recognizer performance. A major part of this technical report is devoted to giving our methods a good theoretical footing. In particular, we do not start by asserting that maximum likelihood is obviously the right thing to do. Instead, the problem is formalized in terms of a probability measure; the learning algorithm must then be arranged to make this probability conform to the customer\u2019s needs. This formulation can be applied to other segmentation problems such as speech recognition. Our recognizer using these principles works noticeably better than the previous state of the art.

We present a tutorial on nonparametric inference and its relation to neural networks, and we use the statistical viewpoint to highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural models. We illustrate the main points with some recognition experiments involving artificial data as well as handwritten numerals. In way of conclusion, we suggest that current-generation feedforward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning, regardless of parallel-versus-serial hardware or other implementation issues. Furthermore, we suggest that the fundamental challenges in neural modeling are about representation rather than learning per se. This last point is supported by additional experiments with handwritten numerals."
