Previous experiments with context have mostly been done on home-grown datasets, often with non-standard baselines, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of contextual information. In this work, we present our analysis on a standard dataset, using top-performing local appearance detectors as baseline. We evaluate several different sources of context and ways to utilize it. While we employ many contextual cues that have been used before, we also propose a few novel ones including the use of geographic context and a new approach for using object spatial support."

Towards this goal, we propose a novel deformable part-based model which exploits region-based segmentation algorithms that compute candidate object regions by bottom-up clustering followed by ranking of those regions. Our approach allows every detection hypothesis to select a segment (including void), and scores each box in the image using both the traditional HOG filters as well as a set of novel segmentation features. Thus our model ``blends'' between the detector and segmentation models. Since our features can be computed very efficiently given the segments, we maintain the same complexity as the original DPM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in PASCAL VOC 2010, and show that when employing only a root filter our approach outperforms Dalal & Triggs detector on all classes, achieving 13% higher average AP. When employing the parts, we outperform the original DPM in $19$ out of $20$ classes, achieving an improvement of 8% AP. Furthermore, we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on VOC 2010 test by 4%."

Learning and inference in our model are efficient as we reason at the segment level, and introduce auxiliary variables that allow us to decompose the inherent high-order potentials into pairwise potentials between a few variables with small number of states (at most the number of classes). Inference is done via a convergent message-passing algorithm, which, unlike graph-cuts inference, has no submodularity restrictions and does not require potential specific moves. We believe this is very important, as it allows us to encode our ideas and prior knowledge about the problem without the need to change the inference engine every time we introduce a new potential. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the MSRC-21 benchmark, while being much faster. Importantly, our holistic model is able to improve performance in all tasks."

Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much \"head room\" there is to improve segmentation by focusing research efforts on each of the tasks. One of the interesting findings from our slew of studies was that human classification of isolated super-pixels, while being worse than current machine classifiers, provides a significant boost in performance when plugged into the CRF! Fascinated by this finding, we conducted in depth analysis of the human generated potentials. This inspired a new machine potential which significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on the MRSC dataset."

Context models can efficiently rule out some unlikely combinations or locations of objects and guide detectors to produce a semantically coherent interpretation of a scene. However, the performance benefit from using context models has been limited because most of these methods were tested on datasets with only a few object categories, in which most images contain only one or two object categories. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset with images that contain many instances of different object categories and propose an efficient model that captures the contextual information among more than a hundred of object categories. We show that our context model can be applied to scene understanding tasks that local detectors alone cannot solve."

As a consequence, they inadvertently commit to the granularity of information implicit in the labels. Moreover, large portions of the images may not belong to any of the manually-chosen categories, and these unlabeled regions are typically neglected. In this paper, we overcome both these drawbacks and propose a contextual cue that exploits unlabeled regions in images. Our approach adaptively determines the granularity (scene, inter-object, intra-object, etc.) at which contextual information is captured. In order to extract the proposed contextual cue, we consider a scene to be a structured configuration of objects and regions; just as an object is a composition of parts. We thus learn our proposed \u201ccontextual meta-objects\u201d using any off-the-shelf object detector, which makes our proposed cue widely accessible to the community. Our results show that incorporating our proposed cue provides a relative improvement of 12% over a state-of-the-art object detector on the challenging PASCAL dataset."

In the last two decades, there has been much progress and there are already object recognition systems operating in commercial products. However, most of the algorithms for detecting objects perform an exhaustive search across all locations and scales in the image comparing local image regions with an object model. That approach ignores the semantic structure of scenes and tries to solve the recognition problem by brute force. In the real world, objects tend to covary with other objects, providing a rich collection of contextual associations. These contextual associations can be used to reduce the search space by looking only in places in which the object is expected to be; this also increases performance, by rejecting patterns that look like the target but appear in unlikely places.\n Most modeling attempts so far have defined the context of an object in terms of other previously recognized objects. The drawback of this approach is that inferring the context becomes as difficult as detecting each object. An alternative view of context relies on using the entire scene information holistically. This approach is algorithmically attractive since it dispenses with the need for a prior step of individual object recognition. In this paper, we use a probabilistic framework for encoding the relationships between context and object properties and we show how an integrated system provides improved performance. We view this as a significant step toward general purpose machine vision systems."

Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g. keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations, the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition. Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes."

We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in formulating recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs.-all winning margin that may not preserve the ordering of segment qualities inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, our learning method produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses are likely to spatially overlap the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape as well as PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

Towards this goal, we propose a holistic approach that exploits 2D segmentation, 3D geometry, as well as contextual relations between scenes and objects. Specifically, we extend the CPMC [3] framework to 3D in order to generate candidate cuboids, and develop a conditional random field to integrate information from different sources to classify the cuboids. With this formulation, scene classification and 3D object recognition are coupled and can be jointly solved through probabilistic inference. We test the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that through effective evidence integration and holistic reasoning, our approach achieves substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art."

One reason is their ability to incorporate contextual information at different scales. However, these models do not allow multiple labels to be assigned to a single node. At higher scales in the image, this yields an oversimplified model, since multiple classes can be reasonable expected to appear within one region. This simplified model especially limits the impact that observations at larger scales may have on the CRF model. Neglecting the information at larger scales is undesirable since class-label estimates based on these scales are more reliable than at smaller, noisier scales. To address this problem, we propose a new potential, called harmony potential, which can encode any possible combination of class labels. We propose an effective sampling strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Pascal VOC 2009 and MSRC-21."

We propose strategies to search for objects which intelligently explore the space of windows by making sequential observations at locations decided based on previous observations. Our strategies adapt to the class being searched and to the content of a particular test image, exploiting context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. In addition to being more elegant than sliding windows, we demonstrate experimentally on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset that our strategies evaluate two orders of magnitude fewer windows while achieving higher object detection performance."

In this paper, we explore the roles that appearance and contextual information play in object recognition. Through machine experiments and human studies, we show that the importance of contextual information varies with the quality of the appearance information, such as an image's resolution. Our machine experiments explicitly model context between object categories through the use of relative location and relative scale, in addition to co-occurrence. With the use of our context model, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSRC and Corel data sets. We perform recognition tests for machines and human subjects on low and high resolution images, which vary significantly in the amount of appearance information present, using just the object appearance information, the combination of appearance and context, as well as just context without object appearance information (blind recognition). We also explore the impact of the different sources of context (co-occurrence, relative-location, and relative-scale). We find that the importance of different types of contextual information varies significantly across data sets such as MSRC and PASCAL."

This approach requires no training, and it can easily scale to datasets with tens of thousands of images and hundreds of labels. It works by scene-level matching with global image descriptors, followed by superpixel-level matching with local features and efficient Markov random field (MRF) optimization for incorporating neighborhood context. Our MRF setup can also compute a simultaneous labeling of image regions into semantic classes (e.g., tree, building, car) and geometric classes (sky, vertical, ground). Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art non-parametric method based on SIFT Flow on a dataset of 2,688 images and 33 labels. In addition, we report per-pixel rates on a larger dataset of 15,150 images and 170 labels. To our knowledge, this is the first complete evaluation of image parsing on a dataset of this size, and it establishes a new benchmark for the problem."

In particular, we infer the scene topology, geometry as well as traffic activities from a short video sequence acquired with a single camera mounted on a moving car. Our generative model takes advantage of dynamic information in the form of vehicle tracklets as well as static information coming from semantic labels and geometry (i.e., vanishing points). Experiments show that our approach outperforms a discriminative baseline based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) which has access to the same image information. Furthermore, as we reason about objects in 3D, we are able to significantly increase the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors in their ability to estimate object orientation."

However, the cues available for recognizing a 300 pixel tall object are qualitatively different from those for recognizing a 3 pixel tall object. We argue that for sensors with finite resolution, one should instead use scale-variant, or multiresolution representations that adapt in complexity to the size of a putative detection window. We describe a multiresolution model that acts as a deformable part-based model when scoring large instances and a rigid template with scoring small instances. We also examine the interplay of resolution and context, and demonstrate that context is most helpful for detecting low-resolution instances when local models are limited in discriminative power. We demonstrate impressive results on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark, which contains object instances at a wide range of scales. Whereas recent state-of-the-art methods demonstrate missed detection rates of 86%-37% at 1 false-positive-per-image, our multiresolution model reduces the rate to 29%."

Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback to the user."

In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48%) on the challenging VOC 2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are possible with such an approach."

Most existing work ignores physical interactions or is applied only to tidy rooms and hallways. Our goal is to parse typical, often messy, indoor scenes into floor, walls, supporting surfaces, and object regions, and to recover support relationships. One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred support lead to better object segmentation."

Unsupervised visual category discovery is useful to mine for recurring objects without human supervision, but existing methods assume no prior information and thus tend to perform poorly for cluttered scenes with multiple objects. We propose to leverage knowledge about previously learned categories to enable more accurate discovery. We introduce a novel object-graph descriptor to encode the layout of object-level co-occurrence patterns relative to an unfamiliar region, and show that by using it to model the interaction between an image's known and unknown objects we can better detect new visual categories. Rather than mine for all categories from scratch, our method identifies new objects while drawing on useful cues from familiar ones. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets and demonstrate clear improvements in discovery over conventional purely appearance-based baselines."

The learned model is used for automatic visual understanding and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits texture-layout filters, novel features based on textons, which jointly model patterns of texture and their spatial layout. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating the unary classifier in a conditional random field, which (i) captures the spatial interactions between class labels of neighboring pixels, and (ii) improves the segmentation of specific object instances. Efficient training of the model on large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.\n\nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy is demonstrated on four varied databases: (i) the MSRC 21-class database containing photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, (ii) the 7-class Corel subset and (iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in He et\u00a0al. (Proceeding of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, vol.\u00a02, pp.\u00a0695\u2013702, June 2004), and (iv) a set of video sequences of television shows. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for objects that are highly textured (grass, trees, etc.), highly structured (cars, faces, bicycles, airplanes, etc.), and even articulated (body, cow, etc.).\n"

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

In this paper, we propose a novel, nonparametric approach for object recognition and scene parsing using a new technology we name label transfer. For an input image, our system first retrieves its nearest neighbors from a large database containing fully annotated images. Then, the system establishes dense correspondences between the input image and each of the nearest neighbors using the dense SIFT flow algorithm [28], which aligns two images based on local image structures. Finally, based on the dense scene correspondences obtained from SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on challenging databases. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training classifiers or appearance models for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure."

While such models are appealing from a theoretical point of view, it has been difficult to demonstrate that they lead to performance advantages on challenging datasets. Here we develop a grammar model for person detection and show that it outperforms previous high-performance systems on the PASCAL benchmark. Our model represents people using a hierarchy of deformable parts, variable structure and an explicit model of occlusion for partially visible objects. To train the model, we introduce a new discriminative framework for learning structured prediction models from weakly-labeled data."

In particular, we examine effects of occlusion, size, aspect ratio, visibility of parts, viewpoint, localization error, and confusion with semantically similar objects, other labeled objects, and background. We analyze two classes of detectors: the Vedaldi et al. multiple kernel learning detector and different versions of the Felzenszwalb et al. detector. Our study shows that sensitivity to size, localization error, and confusion with similar objects are the most impactful forms of error. Our analysis also reveals that many different kinds of improvement are necessary to achieve large gains, making more detailed analysis essential for the progress of recognition research. By making our software and annotations available, we make it effortless for future researchers to perform similar analysis."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

In this paper we explore novel pooling techniques that encode the second-order statistics of local descriptors inside a region. To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over free-form regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

In this paper we consider a class of global potentials defined over all variables in the CRF. We show how they can be readily optimised using standard graph cut algorithms at little extra expense compared to a standard pairwise field. \n \nThis result can be directly used for the problem of class based image segmentation which has seen increasing recent interest within computer vision. Here the aim is to assign a label to each pixel of a given image from a set of possible object classes. Typically these methods use random fields to model local interactions between pixels or super-pixels. One of the cues that helps recognition is global object co-occurrence statistics, a measure of which classes (such as chair or motorbike) are likely to occur in the same image together. There have been several approaches proposed to exploit this property, but all of them suffer from different limitations and typically carry a high computational cost, preventing their application on large images. We find that the new model we propose produces an improvement in the labelling compared to just using a pairwise model."

For high level visual tasks, such low-level image representations are potentially not enough. In this paper, we propose a high-level image representation, called the Object Bank, where an image is represented as a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, blind to the testing dataset or visual task. Leveraging on the Object Bank representation, superior performances on high level visual recognition tasks can be achieved with simple off-the-shelf classifiers such as logistic regression and linear SVM. Sparsity algorithms make our representation more efficient and scalable for large scene datasets, and reveal semantically meaningful feature patterns."

We propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). We represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. Our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. This enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different \"detectability\" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. We apply our method to the six animal categories in the PASCAL VOC dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% AP) and provides a richer representation for objects. During training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for PASCAL VOC 2010, which provides a mask for each part."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

This observation raises the question of how many pixels are required to form a meaningful representation of an image and identify the objects it contains. In this article, we show that very small thumbnail images at the spatial resolution of 32 \u00d7 32 color pixels provide enough information to identify the semantic category of real-world scenes. Most strikingly, this low resolution permits observers to report, with 80% accuracy, four to five of the objects that the scene contains, despite the fact that some of these objects are unrecognizable in isolation. The robustness of the information available at very low resolution for describing semantic content of natural images could be an important asset to explain the speed and efficiently at which the human brain comprehends the gist of visual scenes."
