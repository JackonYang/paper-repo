Thus the user can start from an idea and explore different ways to express it. This fifth edition brings Roget's original category concept towards the 21st century. 325,000 words and phrases are grouped by concept into 1073 categories with all synonyms, antonyms and related words presented together for quick and easy reference. The text has been fully revised and expanded, including 31 entirely new categories, such as computers, fitness and exercise, and all kinds of sport. The whole range of language from archaisms to the latest slang (labelled) is included."

First, we assume we can isolate elements scparately within the domain of meaning and within the domain of surface expression. These are semantic elements like \u2018Motion\u2019, \u2018Path\u2019, \u2018Figure\u2019, \u2018Ground\u2019, \u2018Manner\u2019, anrl \u2018Cause\u2019, and surface elements like \u2018verb\u2019, \u2018adposition\u2019, \u2018subordinate clausc\u2019, and what we will cliaracterize as \u2018satellite\u2019. Second, we examine which semantic elements are expressed by which surface elements. This relatinnship is largely not orle-to-one. A coml)ination of semnntic elements can be expressed by a single surface elemcnt, or \u00fc single semantic element hy a combinatiun of surface elements. Or again, semantic elemeuts of different types can be exptessed by the same type of surface elenient, as well as the same type by severa1 dif-t\u2018erent ones. We finrl here a range of typological palterns anti universal principies. We do n\u00bbt look at every case of semantic-to-surface association, but only at enes that constitute a pervasive pattern, either within a language 01\u2019 across lunguages. Our particular concern is to understand how sucll patterns compare across languages. \u2018I\u2019llilt is, Eor a particular semantic domain, we ask if languages exhibit a wicle variety of patterns, \u00e4 comp\u00fcratively sniall n~~uiller of patlerns (a typology), or a single pattern (a universal).

This model is built up within a computer by 'recoding' a body of information from an ordinary dictionary into a complex network of elements and associations. Then the ability of a program to use the resulting model memory effectively for simulating human performance provides a test of its design. One simulation program, now running, is given the model memory and is required to compare and contrast the meanings of arbitrary pairs of English words. For each pair, the program locates any relevant semantic information within the model memory, draws inferences on the basis of this, and thereby discovers various relationships between the meanings of the two words. Finally, it creates English text to express its conclusions. The design principles embodied in the memory model together with some of the methods used by the program constitute a theory of how human memory for semantic and other conceptual material may be formatted, organized, and used.

The subset that for a number of reasons appeared appropriate to this undertaking centres around the dimensional adjectives of German. That the en terprise ultimately produced a less integrated and complete result than expected is due to several reasons. Some of these are of an intrinsic nature, ever present, and not particularly surprising. Some, however, are related to the character of the project itself and are worth commenting upon, as they reflect specific expe riences and difficulties which we encountered during several years of working on the project. We started from the assumption that the dimensional adjectives constitute a sufficiently rich, but nevertheless limited domain of grammatical and concep tual structure which is fairly well understood and explored in relevant aspects. Consequently we expected that summarizing, integrating, and extending the nu merous results that were available should quickly lead to a more complete picture of the interaction of the components involved. However, even had the premise of this assumption been correct, the conclusion turned out to be wrong fairly early in the project. On closer inspection, the investigations of the phenomena were much less complete, the facts agreed upon less systematic, and the proposed anal yses far less convincing than supposed initially.\""

Linguistics, especially transformational grammar, has matured recently at an alarming rate, so that transformational grammarians may seem to have developed increasingly narrow interests and, moreover, to have become so embroiled in the muddy business of securing their own positions, digging themselves in on a narrow front, that whether they are involved in civil war or are continuing to extend the frontiers of linguistic knowledge is often very unclear-even to themselves. I fancy that scarcely a single transformationalist will bother to raise his head as Professor Chafe wings his way overhead firing enthusiastically but erratically in all directions. The outsider is much more likely to notice the high-flier, and he needs some help in assessing the significance of Chafe's sally-perhaps it would not be out of place to give him at the same time some reports from the transformational trenches, and to assure him that all is still well there. I shall assume that he is reasonably familiar with Chomsky's Syntactic Structures1 and the main developments in transformational grammar up to about 1965, when Chomsky published his Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.2 Not that I believe the college English teacher has any (narrow professional) reason to bother much about contemporary linguistics. On the contrary, recent developments in transformational grammar should make it perfectly clear that there is no hope whatever of making direct use of that approach to linguistics in English teaching-at any rate not along the lines of existing attempts. And Chafe's work seems even less relevant."

Meronymic relations ore further distinguished from other inclusion relations, such as spatial inclusion, and class inclusion, and from several other semantic relations: attribution, attachment, and ownership. This taxonomy is then used to explain cases of apparent intransitivity in merological syllogisms, and standard form syllogisms whose premises express different inclusion relations. The data suggest that intransitivities arise due to equivocations between different types of semantic relations. These results are then explained by means of the relation element theory which accounts for the character and behavior of semantic relations in terms of more primitive relational elements. The inferential phenomena observed are then explained by means of a single principle of element matching."

This paper provides empirical support for the co-occurrence hypothesis in a corpus analysis of all high-frequency adjectives and their antonyms and of a major group of morphologically derived antonyms (e.g., impossible, un-happy). We show that very high co-occurrence rates do appear to characterize all antonymous adjective pairs, supporting the precondition for the formation of the association; and we find that the syntactic contexts of these co-occurrences raise the intrinsic associability of antonyms when they do co-occur. We show that via one of these patterns, mutual substitution within otherwise repeated phrases in a sentence, the co-occurrences hypothesis captures the generalizations that were the basis for the substitutability hypothesis for the formation of antonymic associations."

                "text": "THE volume* brings together thirteen essays by eleven authors, all of which have been previously published in one form or another, mainly in American journals ; and there is a brief introduction by the editor. The word ' semantics' has been used in several ways, particularly in recent years. M Breal took semantics as a philological study, while Korzybski proposed it as a cure for all the ills of the world. There is, then, a certain confusion about what semantics is. As a scientific discipline, however, semantics denvcs from Tarski's investigations, which were first published in Polish in 1933 and in German in 1935 under the title Da Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen. The present collection of essays begms with ' The Semantic Conception of Truth' by Tarski, published in 1944. This is a short version of his previous work ; and it has already become a classic of the literature of modern logic. The achievement lies not only in having given a materially adequate and formally correct definition of truth, but equally in the method by which this result was obtained. The age-old controversy between the correspondence and the coherence theories of traditional philosophy is swept away. A conception of truth is given which is closer to ordinary usage than either theory can provide. The solution is made possible, however, only by reconstructing in logical terms the vague and ambiguous expressions of ordinary language. For such a language\u2014though in some sense open, since it allows us to mtroduce new terms and to change usages \u2014is in fact semanucally closed. It contains, apart from its expressions, also the names of these expressions, as well as semantic terms like ' true' referring to sentences in this language ; at the same time it is assumed that the laws of normal logic hold. This creates the antinomies, for example, of the Liar : natural language is logically inconsistent. Problems of truth and of meaning can be strictly solved only for formalised languages. This result is of import not only to philosophy but also to science. And, indeed, the history of science shows how our theories become more precise with progressive formalisation, in accord with the semantic conception. Semantics arose from the study of the foundations of logic and of mathematics. While ordinary logic was always felt to be too narrow"

Dr Jackendoff has attempted to take a broader view of semantics, studying the important contribution it makes to the syntactic patterns of English.The research is carried out in the framework of an interpretive theory, that is, a theory of grammar in which syntactic structures are given interpretations by an autonomous syntactic component. The book investigates a wide variety of semantic rules, stating them in considerable detail and extensively treating their consequences for the syntactic component of the grammar. In particular, it is shown that the hypothesis that transformations do not change meaning must be abandoned; but equally stringent restrictions on transformations are formulated within the interpretive theory.Among the areas of grammar discussed are the well-known problems of case relations, pronominalization, negation, and quantifiers. In addition, the author presents semantic analyses of such neglected areas as adverbs and intonation contours; he also proposes radically new approaches to the so-called Crossover Principle, the control problem for complement subjects, parentheticals, and the interpretation of nonspecific noun phrases."

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be."

This paperl does not attempt to present a semantic theory of a natural language, but rather to characterize the form of such a theory. A semantic theory of a natural language is part of a linguistic description of that language. Our problem, on the other hand, is part of the general theory of language, fully on a par with the problem of characterizing the structure of grammars of natural languages. A characterization of the abstract form of a semantic theory is given by a metatheory which answers such questions as these: What is the domain of a semantic theory? What are the descriptive and explanatory goals of a semantic theory? What mechanisms are employed in pursuit of these goals? What are the empirical and methodological constraints upon a semantic theory? The present paper approaches the problem of characterizing the form of semantic theories by describing the structure of a semantic theory of English. There can be little doubt but that the results achieved will apply directly to semantic theories of languages closely related to English. The question of their applicability to semantic theories of more distant languages will be left for subsequent investigations to explore. Nevertheless, the present investigation will provide results that can be applied to semantic theories of languages unrelated to English and suggestions about how to proceed with the construction of such theories. We may put our problem this way: What form should a semantic theory of a natural language take to accommodate in the most revealing way the facts about the semantic structure of that language supplied by descriptive research? This question is of primary importance at the present stage of the development of semantics because semantics suffers not from a dearth of facts about meanings and meaning relations in natural languages, but rather from the lack of an adequate theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these facts. Facts about the semantics of natural languages have been contributed in abundance by many diverse fields, including philosophy, linguistics, philology, and \u2026"

                "text": "Concepts may be organized into taxonomies varying in inclusiveness or abstraction, such as furniture, table, card table or animal, bird, robin. For taxonomies of common objects and organisms, the basic level, the level of table and bird, has been determined to be most informative (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976). Psychology, linguistics, and anthropology have produced a variety of measures of perception, behavior, and communication that converge on the basic level. Here, we present data showing that the basic level differs qualitatively from other levels in taxonomies of objects and of living things and present an explanation for why so many measures converge at that level. We have found that part terms proliferate in subjects' listings of attributes characterizing category members at the basic level, but are rarely listed at a general level. At a more specific level, fewer parts are listed, though more are judged to be true. Basic level objects are distinguished from one another by parts, but members of subordinate categories share parts and differ from one another on other attributes. Informants agree on the parts of objects, and also on relative \"goodness\" of the various parts. Perceptual salience and functional significance both appear to contribute to perceived part goodness. Names of parts frequently enjoy a duality not evident in names of other attributes; they refer at once to a particular appearance and to a particular function. We propose that part configuration underlies the various empirical operations of perception, behavior, and communication that converge at the basic level. Part configuration underlies the perceptual measures because it determines the shapes of objects to a large degree. Parts underlie the behavioral tasks because most of our behaviors is indirect toward parts of objects. Labeling appears to follow the natural breaks of perception and behavior; consequently, part configuration also underlies communication measures. Because elements of more abstract taxonomies, such as scenes and events, can also be decomposed into parts, this analysis provides a bridge to organization in other domains of knowledge. Knowledge organization by parts (partonomy) is contrasted to organization by kinds (taxonomy). Taxonomies serve to organize numerous classes of entities and to allow inference from larger sets to sets included in them. Partonomies serve to separate entities into their structural components and to organize knowledge of function by components of structure. The informativeness of the basic level may originate from the availability of inference from structure to function at that level."

It is argued that these studies support theoretical assumptions concerning the functional independence of various components of normal language processing. Studies of the structure of the lexicon in aphasia provide support for componential theories of lexical semantics in that different types of features of meaning can be selectively disrupted under conditions of brain damage. Studies of sentence comprehension support the existence of a syntactic mechanism that is independent of lexically based heuristic strategies for assigning meaning. There is evidence that these independent elements of language are subserved by different portions of the dominant hemisphere of the brain. Focal brain damage can thus cause selective disruption of components, allowing the separation of elements that are highly integrated in the normal adult. Studies of aphasic language, therefore, provide a valuable source of constraints on theories of normal language processing."

Judgments of the type \"A is larger than B\" or \"This can contains less milk than that\" are made long before it is possible to say, e.g., \"A is twice as large as B\" or \"A has a volume of 25 cubic feet, B a volume of 20 cubic feet, therefore A is larger than B by 5 cubic feet,\" or \"This can contains a quart of milk, that one 3 quarts of milk, therefore the former has less milk in it.\" In other words, judgments of quantity in terms of units of measure or in terms of number always presuppose, explicitly or implicitly, preliminary judgments of grading. The term four means something only when it is known to refer to a number which is \"less than\" certain others, say five, six, seven, arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses, and \"more than\" certain others, say one, two, three, arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses. Similarly, a foot as a unit of linear measure has no meaning whatever unless it is known to be more than some other stretch, say an inch, and less than a third stretch, say a yard. Judgments of \"more than\" and \"less than\" may be said to be based on perceptions of \"envelopment.\" If A can be \"enveloped by\" B, contained by it, so placed in contact with B, either actually or by the imagination, as to seem to be held within its compass instead of extending beyond it, it is judged to be \"less than\" B, while B is judged to be \"more than\" A. With only two existents of the same class, A and B, the judgments \"A is less than B\" and \"B is more than A\" can be translated into the form \"A is small\" and \"B is large.\" In the case of the two cans of milk, we may say \"There is little milk in this can\" and \"There is much milk in that can.\" Again, if there are three men in one room and seven in another, we may either say \"The first room has fewer men in it than the second\" and \"The second room has more men in it than the first\" or, if we prefer, \"The first room has few men in it\" and \"The second room has many men in it.\"1 Such contrasts as small and large, little and much, few and many, give us a deceptive feeling of absolute values within the field of quantity comparable to such qualitative differences as red and green within the field of color perception. This feeling is an illusion, however, which is largely due to the linguistic fact that the grading which is implicit in these terms is not formally indicated, whereas it is made explicit in such judgments as \"There were fewer people there than here\" or \"He has more milk than I.\" In other words, many, to take but one example, embodies no class of judgments clustering about a given quantity norm which is applicable to every type of experience, in the sense in which red or green is applicable to every experience in which color can have a place, but is, properly speaking, a purely relative term which loses all significance when deprived of its conno-"

The theory assumes that emotions have a two-fold communicative function, both externally amongst members of the species, and internally within the brain so as to bypass complex inferences. It implies that there is a small number of basic signals that can set up characteristic emotional modes within the organism, roughly corresponding to happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust. In human beings, these modes can be modulated by the propositional content of the cognitive evaluation that caused the emotion signal, or else, if this content fails to impinge on consciousness, these modes can be experienced as emotions that have occurred for no apparent reason. According to this \u201ccommunicative\u201d theory, there should be a set of terms that refer to basic emotions, and these terms should have no internal semantics, since they cannot be analysed into anything more basic, such as a prototype or..."

In common-sense psychology, reasoning is a kind of thinking and reasoning is part of problem solving. People's conceptions of these mental kinds and parts can furnish clues to the ordinary meaning of these terms and to the differences between folk and scientific psychology. In this article, we use a new technique for deriving partial orders to analyze subjects' decisions about whether one mental activity is a kind or part of another. The resulting taxonomies and partonomies differ from those of common object categories in exhibiting a converse relation in this domain: One mental activity is a part of another if the second is a kind of the first. The derived taxonomies and partonomies also allow us to predict results from further experiments that examine subjects' memory for these activities, their ratings of the activities' importance, and their judgements about whether there could be \"possible minds\" that possess some of the activities but not others."

                "text": "Virtually all AI and object-oriented programming languages include inheritance systems. Common examples are FRL, KRL, KLONE, NETL, Simula, Smalltalk, Flavors, and Ada. Systems that permit exceptions to inherited properties, which involves a form of nonmonotonic reasoning, remained unformalized until quite recently. The lack of a formal theory hid some defects in existing implementations. One defect was an incorrect treatment of networks with multiple grounded expansions. (A grounded expansion is the nonmonotonic equivalent of a \"theory\" in ordinary monotonic reasoning.) Another defect was a tendency to reason incorrectly when redundant statements are presented. \nWe present a formal mathematical theory of inheritance and show how the defects in existing systems can be corrected. Our formalism bears some relation to default and nonmonotonic logics, but includes an important hierarchical notion the other systems lack. We prove theorems about the consistency, existence, uniqueness, and constructibility of grounded expansions, and we provide a formal semantics for inheritance in terms of constructible lattices of predicates. \nThe formal theory of inheritance is then applied to the formal analysis of a massively parallel computer architecture known as a parallel marker propagation machine (PMPM), of which the best-known example is Fahlman's NETL Machine. This machine has been proposed as a high speed inference engine for AI. We show that a PMPM can perform correct inheritance reasoning only in certain limited cases. However, through a technique known as \"conditioning,\" the topology of a network can be altered to force the PMPM to produce correct results. We show that conditioning is always possible, and present a simple yet efficient conditioning algorithm. \nAn extension to the usual notion of inheritance allows us to infer, if Fred is a citizen and Dick a crook, that Fred dislikes Dick from the relation \"citizens dislike crooks.\" An exception to such a relation might be \"gullible citizens don't dislike elected crooks.\" We extend our earlier results by developing a formal theory of inheritable relations, including exceptions and their interaction with the IS-A \nhierarchy, and showing how a correct implementation on a PMPM may be achieved through conditioning. \n*This research was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DOD), ARPA Order No. 3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory Under Contract F33615-81-K-1539.

Two decks of cards provide a plurality of play situations whereby two persons representing offensive and defensive quarterbacks can match wits to move a simulated football back and forth upon the gameboard. A multiplicity of down cards are controlled by the player starting on the offense while a multiplicity of kick cards are controlled by the defensive player. The offensive player, using a shield to hide his choice from view, chooses either a run or a pass and places a play designation marker on the appropriate space on the gameboard to so indicate. The defensive player, on a signal, then attempts to anticipate the offensive play. The outcome is determined by comparing the offensive call with the defensive guess. Correct defensive guesses are statistically more favorable for the defensive player while incorrect defensive guesses favor the offensive player."

Among the examples one finds discussed in the literature, most have been English verbs.
