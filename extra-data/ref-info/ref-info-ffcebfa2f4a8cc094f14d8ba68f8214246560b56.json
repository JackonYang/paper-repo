A complex object is described by decomposition into sub-parts and relations of these sub-parts. The individual parts are described by generalized cones, which are defined by a space curve known as the axis, and arbitrary shaped normal cross-sections along this axis. Techniques for segmenting an object into sub-parts and generating structured, symbolic, graph like descriptions are described. These symbolic descriptions are matched with stored descriptions and the best match is picked for recognition. A limited amount of indexing capability exists to efficiently retrieve a sub-class of similar objects from the models stored in the memory. Indexing is a necessity if a large number of visual models is to be used."

Initially the photograph is subjected to a nonlinear transformation which is based on an edge detection operator by Hueckel. The gray-value variations of a photograph are transformed into short vectors (strokes), which are arranged in a two-dimensional array that has substantially fewer entries than the original image array. The display of a stroke array provides \"outline\" information that is highly intelligible to the human eye. Using graph searching techniques, strokes are assembled into structures called streaks. Streaks are digital curves which exhibit cellular as well as polygonal properties. The representation of streaks as well as other data can be marked directly in the stroke array, thus making the array usable as an associative memory. This greatly facilitates further processing."

Complex objects are represented as structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls, have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which implement generalized cylinder descriptions."

This method is complementary to the use of stereoscopy which relies on matching up sharp detail and will fail on smooth objects. Until now the image processing of single views has been restricted to objects which can meaningfully be considered two-dimensional or bounded by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a first-order non-linear partial differential equation in two unknowns relating the intensity at the image points to the shape of the object. This equation can be solved by means of an equivalent set of five ordinary differential equations. A curve traced out by solving this set of equations for one set of starting values is called a characteristic strip. Starting one of these strips from each point on some initial curve will produce the whole solution surface. The initial curves can usually be constructed around so-called singular points. A number of applications of this method will be discussed including one to lunar topography and one to the scanning electron microscope. In both of these cases great simplifications occur in the equations. A note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative theory of facial make-up is touched upon. An implementation of some of these ideas on the PDP-6 computer with its attached image-dissector camera at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be described, and also a nose-recognition program."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

The foim of the solution derives from a number of premises, one of which Ullman calls \u201cthe locality hypothesis\u201d. \u2018Ihis is \u201cbased in part on cxpcrimcntal obscrvntions, and partly on a theoretical consideration\u201d ([I 51 ~2). \u2018I\u2019hc \u201ccxpcrimcntal observation\u201d rcfcrrcd to is the following: suppose that A\u2019 is a point near A on the filled-in contour AB as shown in Figure 1. If the process by which AB was constructed is applied to A\u2019B, it is claimed that it gcneratcs the portion of AJ3, bctwccn A\u2019 and B. Let us call this property \u201ccxtcnsibility\u201d. Ullman argues that cxtcnsibility, togcthcr with the propcrtics of isotropy, smoothness, and having minimal integral curvature, logically entails a solution consisting of two circles which meet smoothly. In the fit11 version of this paper, we analyze the two-cti solution and formulate the condition for minimal integral curvature. This can bc solved by any descent method such as Newton-Raphson. A program has been written which computes the minimum integral curvature two-circle solution given the boundary angles 4, 8, and AB, and which returns as a result the point at which they meet and at which the curvature is discontinuous (the \u2018knot point\u2019). A tortuous version of this simple proof and program recently appcarcd in [13]. We then show by example that the two circle solution is not in fact extensible."

A multistage decision process is then able to recognize in the input picture the optimal system of lines according to the given figure of merit. Due to the global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy in the particular problem is achieved. The relation between the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed. (Modified author abstract)"
