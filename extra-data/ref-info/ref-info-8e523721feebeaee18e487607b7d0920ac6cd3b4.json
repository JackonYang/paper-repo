Large data sets containing images with associated text (and vice versa) are readily available, and recent work has exploited such data to learn models for linking visual elements to semantics. This requires addressing a correspondence ambiguity because it is generally not known which parts of the images connect with which language elements. In this paper we first discuss using language processing to reduce correspondence ambiguity in loosely labeled image data. We then consider a similar problem of using visual correlates to reduce ambiguity in text with associated images. Only rudimentary image understanding is needed for this task because the image only needs to help differentiate between a limited set of choices, namely the senses of a particular word."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g. keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations, the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition. Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes."

The images and segmentations are from the UCB segmentation benchmark database (Martin et\u00a0al., in International conference on computer vision, vol.\u00a0II, pp.\u00a0416\u2013421, 2001). The database is extended by manually labeling each segment with its most specific semantic concept in WordNet (Miller et\u00a0al., in Int. J. Lexicogr. 3(4):235\u2013244, 1990). The evaluation methodology establishes protocols for mapping algorithm specific localization (e.g., segmentations) to our data, handling synonyms, scoring matches at different levels of specificity, dealing with vocabularies with sense ambiguity (the usual case), and handling ground truth regions with multiple labels. Given these protocols, we develop two evaluation approaches. The first measures the range of semantics that an algorithm can recognize, and the second measures the frequency that an algorithm recognizes semantics correctly. The data, the image labeling tool, and programs implementing our evaluation strategy are all available on-line (kobus.ca//research/data/IJCV_2007).\n\nWe apply this infrastructure to evaluate four algorithms which learn to label image regions from weakly labeled data. The algorithms tested include two variants of multiple instance learning (MIL), and two generative multi-modal mixture models. These experiments are on a significantly larger scale than previously reported, especially in the case of MIL methods. More specifically, we used training data sets up to 37,000 images and training vocabularies of up to 650 words.\n\nWe found that one of the mixture models performed best on image annotation and the frequency correct measure, and that variants of MIL gave the best semantic range performance. We were able to substantively improve the performance of MIL methods on the other tasks (image annotation and frequency correct region labeling) by providing an appropriate prior.\n"

We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated images. We assume that every image is divided into regions, each described by a continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations, we compute a joint probabilistic model of image features and words which allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms the best of the previously reported results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval."

Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost. Finally, the proposed method is shown to be fairly robust to parameter tuning"

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

Our domain is images annotated with keywords where it is not known which part of the image a keyword refers to. In contrast to earlier approaches that build predictive models or classifiers despite the ambiguity, we argue that that it is better to first address the correspondence ambiguity, and then build more complex models from the improved training data. This addresses difficulties of fitting complex models in the face of ambiguity while exploiting all the constraints available from the training data. We contribute a simple and flexible formulation of the problem, and show results validated by a recently developed comprehensive evaluation data set and corresponding evaluation methodology."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."

Machine learning approaches have been explored to model the association between words and images from an annotated set of images and generate annotations for a test image. The paper proposes methods to use a hierarchy defined on the annotation words derived from a text ontology to improve automatic image annotation and retrieval. Specifically, the hierarchy is used in the context of generating a visual vocabulary for representing images and as a framework for the proposed hierarchical classification approach for automatic image annotation. The effect of using the hierarchy in generating the visual vocabulary is demonstrated by improvements in the annotation performance of translation models. In addition to performance improvements, hierarchical classification approaches yield well to constructing multimedia ontologies."

In this paper, we introduce a statistical modeling approach to this problem. Categorized images are used to train a dictionary of hundreds of statistical models each representing a concept. Images of any given concept are regarded as instances of a stochastic process that characterizes the concept. To measure the extent of association between an image and the textual description of a concept, the likelihood of the occurrence of the image based on the characterizing stochastic process is computed. A high likelihood indicates a strong association. In our experimental implementation, we focus on a particular group of stochastic processes, that is, the two-dimensional multiresolution hidden Markov models (2D MHMMs). We implemented and tested our ALIP (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures) system on a photographic image database of 600 different concepts, each with about 40 training images. The system is evaluated quantitatively using more than 4,600 images outside the training database and compared with a random annotation scheme. Experiments have demonstrated the good accuracy of the system and its high potential in linguistic indexing of photographic images."

There have been several studies on automatic image annotation utilizing machine learning techniques, which automatically learn statistical models from annotated images and apply them to generate annotations for unseen images. One common problem shared by most previous learning approaches for automatic image annotation is that each annotated word is predicated for an image independently from other annotated words. In this paper, we proposed a coherent language model for automatic image annotation that takes into account the word-to-word correlation by estimating a coherent language model for an image. This new approach has two important advantages: 1) it is able to automatically determine the annotation length to improve the accuracy of retrieval results, and 2) it can be used with active learning to significantly reduce the required number of annotated image examples. Empirical studies with Corel dataset are presented to show the effectiveness of the coherent language model for automatic image annotation."

Our previous work (Everingham et al. [8]) demonstrated promising results on the task, but the coverage of the method (proportion of video labelled) and generalization was limited by a restriction to frontal faces and nearest neighbour classification. In this paper we build on that method, extending the coverage greatly by the detection and recognition of characters in profile views. In addition, we make the following contributions: (i) seamless tracking, integration and recognition of profile and frontal detections, and (ii) a character specific multiple kernel classifier which is able to learn the features best able to discriminate between the characters. We report results on seven episodes of the TV series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", demonstrating significantly increased coverage and performance with respect to previous methods on this material."

Our dataset is 44,773 face images, obtained by applying a face finder to approximately half a million captioned news images. This dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets, because it contains faces captured \"in the wild\" in a variety of configurations with respect to the camera, taking a variety of expressions, and under illumination of widely varying color. Each face image is associated with a set of names, automatically extracted from the associated caption. Many, but not all such sets contain the correct name. We cluster face images in appropriate discriminant coordinates. We use a clustering procedure to break ambiguities in labelling and identify incorrectly labelled faces. A merging procedure then identifies variants of names that refer to the same individual. The resulting representation can be used to label faces in news images or to organize news pictures by individuals present. An alternative view of our procedure is as a process that cleans up noisy supervised data. We demonstrate how to use entropy measures to evaluate such procedures."

Here, we show how we can do both automatic image annotation and retrieval (using one word queries) from images and videos using a multiple Bernoulli relevance model. The model assumes that a training set of images or videos along with keyword annotations is provided. Multiple keywords are provided for an image and the specific correspondence between a keyword and an image is not provided. Each image is partitioned into a set of rectangular regions and a real-valued feature vector is computed over these regions. The relevance model is a joint probability distribution of the word annotations and the image feature vectors and is computed using the training set. The word probabilities are estimated using a multiple Bernoulli model and the image feature probabilities using a non-parametric kernel density estimate. The model is then used to annotate images in a test set. We show experiments on both images from a standard Corel data set and a set of video key frames from NIST's video tree. Comparative experiments show that the model performs better than a model based on estimating word probabilities using the popular multinomial distribution. The results also show that our model significantly outperforms previously reported results on the task of image and video annotation."

These goals are reflected in a relatively small number of papers that illustrate the breadth of today's object recognition research and the arsenal of techniques at its disposal, and discuss current achievements and outstanding challenges. Most of the chapters are descriptions of technical approaches, intended to capture the current state of the art. Some of the chapters are of a tutorial nature.

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

In this paper, we present a simple rule-based part of speech tagger which automatically acquires its rules and tags with accuracy comparable to stochastic taggers. The rule-based tagger has many advantages over these taggers, including: a vast reduction in stored information required, the perspicuity of a small set of meaningful rules, ease of finding and implementing improvements to the tagger, and better portability from one tag set, corpus genre or language to another. Perhaps the biggest contribution of this work is in demonstrating that the stochastic method is not the only viable method for part of speech tagging. The fact that a simple rule-based tagger that automatically learns its rules can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below."

The sampling procedure is described, in which queries obtained from each library were broadly categorised by image content, identification and accessibility. Attention is focused on the image content requests, for which a categorisation based on facet analysis is developed. The analytical tool which is used for this purpose is based on a schema already well established for the analysis of levels of meaning in images. The project demonstrates the possibility of formulating a general categorisation of requests which seek widely different still and moving image material. The paper concludes with observations on the potential value of embedding such a schema within the user interface of unmediated-query visual information retrieval systems."

Original aspects of the method are, (1) all words assigned to a whole image are inherited to each divided sub-image, (2) the voting probability of each word for a set of divided images is estimated by the result of a vector quantization of the feature vector of sub-images.

The principal novelties that we introduce are: (i) automatic generation of time stamped character annotation by aligning subtitles and transcripts; (ii) strengthening the supervisory information by identifying when characters are speaking; (iii) using complementary cues of face matching and clothing matching to propose common annotations for face tracks.

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

The key to our approach is to view the estimation of multiple motion models as the estimation of a single multibody motion model. This is possible thanks to two important algebraic facts. First, we show that all the image measurements, regardless of their associated motion model, can be fit with a real or complex polynomial. Second, we show that the parameters of the motion model associated with an image measurement can be obtained from the derivatives of the polynomial at the measurement. This leads to a novel motion segmentation algorithm that applies to most of the two-view motion models adopted in computer vision. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algebraic methods in terms of efficiency and robustness, and provides a good initialization for iterative techniques, such as EM, which is strongly dependent on correct initialization."
