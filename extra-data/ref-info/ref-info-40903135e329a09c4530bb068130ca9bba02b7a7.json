It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images."

Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors."

We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework."

In particular, the manifold regularization framework, together with kernel methods, leads to the Laplacian SVM (LapSVM) that has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, the LapSVM solution typically involves kernel expansions of all the labeled and unlabeled examples, and is slow on testing. Moreover, existing semi-supervised learning methods, including the LapSVM, can only handle a small number of unlabeled examples. In this paper, we integrate manifold regularization with the core vector machine, which has been used for large-scale supervised and unsupervised learning. By using a sparsified manifold regularizer and formulating as a center-constrained minimum enclosing ball problem, the proposed method produces sparse solutions with low time and space complexities. Experimental results show that it is much faster than the LapSVM, and can handle a million unlabeled examples on a standard PC; while the LapSVM can only handle several thousand patterns."

However, inference for graph-based methods often does not scale well to very large data sets, since it requires inversion of a large matrix or solution of a large linear program. Moreover, such approaches are inherently transductive, giving predictions for only those points in the unlabeled set, and not for an arbitrary test point. In this paper a new approach is presented that preserves the strengths of graph-based semi-supervised learning while overcoming the limitations of scalability and non-inductive inference, through a combination of generative mixture models and discriminative regularization using the graph Laplacian. Experimental results show that this approach preserves the accuracy of purely graph-based transductive methods when the data has \"manifold structure,\" and at the same time achieves inductive learning with significantly reduced computational cost."

We show that multiple-instance learning enables the recovery of robust category models from images returned by keyword-based search engines. By incorporating constraints that reflect the expected sparsity of true positive examples into a large-margin objective function, our approach remains accurate even when the available text annotations are imperfect and ambiguous. In addition, we show how to iteratively improve the learned classifier by automatically refining the representation of the ambiguously labeled examples. We demonstrate our method with benchmark datasets, and show that it performs well relative to both state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and traditional fully supervised techniques."

We formulate the semi-supervised learning problem by a regularization approach. Here, besides a regression formulation for the labeled data, an additional term is involved which is based on the graph Laplacian for an adjacency graph of all, labeled and unlabeled data points. It reflects the intrinsic geometric structure of the data distribution. We discretize the resulting problem in function space by the sparse grid method and solve the arising equations using the so-called combination technique. In contrast to recently proposed kernel based methods which currently scale cubic in regard to the number of overall data, our method scales only linear, provided that a sparse graph Laplacian is used. This allows to deal with huge data sets which involve millions of points. We show experimental results with the new approach."

                "text": "The explosion of the Internet provides us with a tremendous resource of images shared online. It also confronts vision researchers the problem of finding effective methods to navigate the vast amount of visual information. Semantic image understanding plays a vital role towards solving this problem. One important task in image understanding is object recognition, in particular, generic object categorization. Critical to this problem are the issues of learning and dataset. Abundant data helps to train a robust recognition system, while a good object classifier can help to collect a large amount of images. This paper presents a novel object recognition algorithm that performs automatic dataset collecting and incremental model learning simultaneously. The goal of this work is to use the tremendous resources of the web to learn robust object category models for detecting and searching for objects in real-world cluttered scenes. Humans contiguously update the knowledge of objects when new examples are observed. Our framework emulates this human learning process by iteratively accumulating model knowledge and image examples. We adapt a non-parametric latent topic model and propose an incremental learning framework. Our algorithm is capable of automatically collecting much larger object category datasets for 22 randomly selected classes from the Caltech 101 dataset. Furthermore, our system offers not only more images in each object category but also a robust object category model and meaningful image annotation. Our experiments show that OPTIMOL is capable of collecting image datasets that are superior to the well known manually collected object datasets Caltech 101 and LabelMe."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification tasks."

Specifically, we address the computational challenges of nonlinear dimensionality reduction via Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps, using a graph containing about 18 million nodes and 65 million edges. Since most manifold learning techniques rely on spectral decomposition, we first analyze two approximate spectral decomposition techniques for large dense matrices (Nystrom and column-sampling), providing the first direct theoretical and empirical comparison between these techniques. We next show extensive experiments on learning low-dimensional embeddings for two large face datasets: CMU-PIE (35 thousand faces) and a web dataset (18 million faces). Our comparisons show that the Nystrom approximation is superior to the column-sampling method. Furthermore, approximate Isomap tends to perform better than Laplacian Eigenmaps on both clustering and classification with the labeled CMU-PIE dataset."

We demonstrate that, if a graph has a bipartite structure that contains a small set of nodes separating the remaining from each other, the inference can be equivalently done over an induced graph connecting only the separators. Since each separator influences a certain neighborhood, the method essentially explores the block structure of graphs to improve the scalability. In the next step, instead of identifying the bipartite structure in a given graph, which is often difficult, we propose to construct a set of separators via two methods, one is adjacency matrix factorization and the other is mixture models, which both naturally ends up with a bipartite graph and meanwhile preserves the original data structure. Finally we report results of experiments on a toy problem and an intrusion detection problem."

The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

While the last decade laid foundation to such promise, it also paved the way for a large number of new techniques and systems, got many new people involved, and triggered stronger association of weakly related fields. In this article, we survey almost 300 key theoretical and empirical contributions in the current decade related to image retrieval and automatic image annotation, and in the process discuss the spawning of related subfields. We also discuss significant challenges involved in the adaptation of existing image retrieval techniques to build systems that can be useful in the real world. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for image retrieval research."

In this paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data-point. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art."

This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of SVMs\u0097-kernels--for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. \nLearning with Kernels provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years."

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."

Firstly, an all-in-all labeling framework is proposed to group visual knowledge of three levels: scene level (global geometric description), object level (segmentation, sketch representation, hierarchical decomposition), and low-mid level (2.1D layered representation, object boundary attributes, curve completion, etc.). Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With this tool, we've been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748 annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors."

A key aspect of this method is the distribution according to which columns are sampled from the original matrix. In this work, we present an analysis of different sampling techniques for the Nystrom method. Our analysis includes both empirical and theoretical components. We first present novel experiments with several real world datasets, comparing the performance of the Nystrom method when used with uniform versus non-uniform sampling distributions. Our results suggest that uniform sampling without replacement, in addition to being more efficient both in time and space, produces more effective approximations. This motivates the theoretical part of our analysis which gives the first performance bounds for the Nystrom method precisely when used with uniform sampling without replacement."

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful regression techniques with explicit uncertainty models; we show here how Gaussian Processes with covariance functions defined based on a Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK) can be used for probabilistic object category recognition. The uncertainty model provided by GPs offers confidence estimates at test points, and naturally allows for an active learning paradigm in which points are optimally selected for interactive labeling. We derive a novel active category learning method based on our probabilistic regression model, and show that a significant boost in classification performance is possible, especially when the amount of training data for a category is ultimately very small."

We use diffusion semigroups to generate multiscale geometries in order to organize and represent complex structures. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions or scaling functions of Markov matrices, which describe local transitions, lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newtonian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration. In Part I below, we provide a unified view of ideas from data analysis, machine learning and numerical analysis. In Part II [1], we augment this approach by introducing fast orderN algorithms for homogenization of heterogeneous structures as well as for data representation."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

We use diffusion semigroups to generate multiscale geometries in order to organize and represent complex structures. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions or scaling functions of Markov matrices, which describe local transitions, lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newtonian paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by integration. We provide a unified view of ideas from data analysis, machine learning, and numerical analysis."
