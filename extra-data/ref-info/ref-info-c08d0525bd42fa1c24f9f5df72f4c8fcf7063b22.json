Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation of the written output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is spread over many pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated preprocessing techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these techniques require considerable human effort, and are specific to particular languages and alphabets. This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw online handwriting data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network with an output layer designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic language model. In experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent results using either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM based system in both cases."

The NPen++ recognition engine is based on a multi-state time delay neural network and yields recognition rates from 96% for a 5,000 word dictionary to 93.4% on a 20,000 word dictionary and 91.2% for a 50,000 word dictionary. The proposed tree search and pruning technique reduces the search space considerably without losing too much recognition performance compared to an exhaustive search. This enables the NPen++ recognizer to be run in real-time with large dictionaries. Initial recognition rates for whole sentences are promising and show that the MS-TDNN architecture is suited to recognizing handwritten data ranging from single characters to whole sentences."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms. Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

Today, more than 54 research groups from universities, research centers, and industry are working with this database worldwide. This year, 8 groups with 14 systems are participating in the competition. The systems were tested on known data and on two datasets which are unknown to the participants. The systems are compared on the most important characteristic, the recognition rate. Additionally, the relative speed of the different systems were compared. A short description of the participating groups, their systems, and the results achieved are finally presented."

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency.

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

While Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform other RNNs on tasks involving long time lags. We find that LSTM augmented by \"peephole connections\" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly nonlinear periodic patterns. This makes LSTM a promising approach for tasks that require the accurate measurement or generation of time intervals."

Here we use these principles to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fine- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed. The protein prediction servers are available over the Web at: www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm ."

We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions.
