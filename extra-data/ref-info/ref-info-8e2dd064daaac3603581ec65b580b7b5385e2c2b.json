                "text": "MOTIVATION\nA new hidden Markov model method (SAM-T98) for finding remote homologs of protein sequences is described and evaluated. The method begins with a single target sequence and iteratively builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the sequence and homologs found using the HMM for database search. SAM-T98 is also used to construct model libraries automatically from sequences in structural databases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluate the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three of the test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers are determined by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated database. The method is compared against WU-BLASTP and against DOUBLE-BLAST, a two-step method similar to ISS, but using BLAST instead of FASTA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSAM-T98 had the fewest errors in all tests-dramatically so for the fold-recognition tests. At the minimum-error point on the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins)-domains test, SAM-T98 got 880 true positives and 68 false positives, DOUBLE-BLAST got 533 true positives with 71 false positives, and WU-BLASTP got 353 true positives with 24 false positives. The method is optimized to recognize superfamilies, and would require parameter adjustment to be used to find family or fold relationships. One key to the performance of the HMM method is a new score-normalization technique that compares the score to the score with a reversed model rather than to a uniform null model.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nA World Wide Web server, as well as information on obtaining the Sequence Alignment and Modeling (SAM) software suite, can be found at http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbi o/\n\n\nCONTACT\nkarplus@cse.ucsc.edu; http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/karplus"

The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences."

Here a program called Probe fully automates this process of model construction starting from a single sequence. Central to this program is a powerful new method to locate and align only those, often subtly, conserved patterns essential to the family as a whole. When applied to randomly chosen proteins, Probe found on average about four times as many relationships as a pairwise search and yielded many new discoveries. These include: an obscure subfamily of globins in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans ; two new superfamilies of metallohydrolases; a lipoyl/biotin swinging arm domain in bacterial membrane fusion proteins; and a DH domain in the yeast Bud3 and Fus2 proteins. By identifying distant relationships and merging families into superfamilies in this way, this analysis further confirms the notion that proteins evolved from relatively few ancient sequences. Moreover, this method automatically generates models of these ancient conserved regions for rapid and sensitive screening of sequences."

Given a query set of known homologs, there exist at least three general classes of techniques for nding additional homologs: pairwise sequence comparisons, motif analysis, and hidden Markov modeling. Pairwise sequence comparisons are typically employed when only a single query sequence is known. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), on the other hand, are usually trained with sets of more than 100 sequences. Motif-based methods fall in between these two extremes. The current work compares the performance of representative examples of these three homology detection techniques|using the BLAST, MEME and HMMER software|across a wide range of protein families, using query sets of varying sizes. A linear combination of multiple pairwise sequence comparisons outperforms motif-based and HMM methods for all query set sizes. Furthermore, heuristic pairwise comparison algorithms are much more e cient than the training algorithms for statistical models."

In attempts to overcome this limitation, methods have been developed that use as a query, not a single sequence, but sets of related sequences or a representation of the characteristics shared by related sequences. Here we describe an assessment of three of these methods: the SAM-T98 implementation of a hidden Markov model procedure; PSI-BLAST; and the intermediate sequence search (ISS) procedure. We determined the extent to which these procedures can detect evolutionary relationships between the members of the sequence database PDBD40-J. This database, derived from the structural classification of proteins (SCOP), contains the sequences of proteins of known structure whose sequence identities with each other are 40% or less. The evolutionary relationships that exist between those that have low sequence identities were found by the examination of their structural details and, in many cases, their functional features. For nine false positive predictions out of a possible 432,680, i.e. at a false positive rate of about 1/50,000, SAM-T98 found 35% of the true homologous relationships in PDBD40-J, whilst PSI-BLAST found 30% and ISS found 25%. Overall, this is about twice the number of PDBD40-J relations that can be detected by the pairwise comparison procedures FASTA (17%) and GAP-BLAST (15%). For distantly related sequences in PDBD40-J, those pairs whose sequence identity is less than 30%, SAM-T98 and PSI-BLAST detect three times the number of relationships found by the pairwise methods."

The prediction method uses global descriptors of a protein in terms of the physical, chemical and structural properties of its constituent amino acids. Neural networks are utilized to combine these descriptors in a specific way to discriminate members of a given folding class from members of all other classes. It is shown that a specific amino acid's properties work completely differently on different folding classes. This creates the possibility of finding an individual set of descriptors that works best on a particular folding class."

The method worked well in comparison to other methods used at CASP2 for targets of moderate difficulty, where the closest structure in PDB could be aligned to the target with at least 15% residue identity.

                "text": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both."

A smooth and convergent algorithm is introduced to iteratively adapt the transition and emission parameters of the models from the examples in a given family. The HMM approach is applied to three protein families: globins, immunoglobulins, and kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture the important statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks, including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification. For K sequences of average length N, this approach yields an effective multiple-alignment algorithm which requires O(KN2) operations, linear in the number of sequences."

This allows us to assess, understand, and improve our automatic method against an objective, manually derived standard, a type of comprehensive evaluation that has not yet been possible for other structural alignment algorithms. Our basic approach directly matches the backbones of two structures, using repeated cycles of dynamic programming and least\u2010squares fitting to determine an alignment minimizing coordinate difference. Because of simplicity, our method can be readily modified to take into account additional features of protein structure such as the orientation of side chains or the location\u2010dependent cost of opening a gap. Our basic method, augmented by such modifications, can find reasonable alignments for all but 1.5% of the known structural similarities in scop, i.e., all but 32 of the 2,107 superfamily pairs. We discuss the specific protein structural features that make these 32 pairs so difficult to align and show how our procedure effectively partitions the relationships in scop into different categories, depending on what aspects of protein structure are involved (e.g., depending on whether or not consideration of side\u2010chain orientation is necessary for proper alignment). We also show how our pairwise alignment procedure can be extended to generate a multiple alignment for a group of related structures. We have compared these alignments in detail with corresponding manual ones culled from the literature. We find good agreement (to within 95% for the core regions), and detailed comparison highlights how particular protein structural features (such as certain strands) are problematical to align, giving somewhat ambiguous results. With these improvements and systematic tests, our procedure should be useful for the development of scop and the future classification of protein folds.

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a \"graphic matrix\" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices."

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field."

Selection of the best descriptors was achieved by a computer-simulated neural network trained on a data base consisting of 83 folding classes. Protein-chain descriptors include overall composition, transition, and distribution of amino acid attributes, such as relative hydrophobicity, predicted secondary structure, and predicted solvent exposure. Cross-validation testing was performed on 15 of the largest classes. The test shows that proteins were assigned to the correct class (correct positive prediction) with an average accuracy of 71.7%, whereas the inverse prediction of proteins as not belonging to a particular class (correct negative prediction) was 90-95% accurate. When tested on 254 structures used in this study, the top two predictions contained the correct class in 91% of the cases."

Many turns between secondary structural elements were accurately predicted. Estimates of the confidence of prediction correlated well with the accuracy over the whole set. Bias toward structures used to develop the library was minimal, probably because of the extensive use of cross\u2010validation. However, helix positions were better predicted by the PHD program. The method is likely to be sensitive to the quality of the sequence alignment. A general measure for evaluating local structure predictions is suggested.

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily."

A sequence family can often be described by a group of one or more motifs, and an effective search must combine the scores for matching a sequence to each of the motifs in the group. We describe three methods for combining match scores and estimating the statistical significance of the combined scores and evaluate the search quality (classification accuracy) and the accuracy of the estimate of statistical significance of each. The three methods are: 1) sum of scores, 2) sum of reduced variates, 3) product of score p-values. We show that method 3) is superior to the other two methods in both regards, and that combining motif scores indeed gives better search accuracy. The MAST sequence homology search algorithm utilizing the product of p-values scoring method is available for interactive use and downloading at URL http:/(/)www.sdsc.edu/MEME."

Every protein sequence is partitioned into segments of 50 amino acid residues and a dynamic programming distance is calculated between each pair of segments. This space of segments is initially embedded into Euclidean space. The algorithm that we apply embeds every finite metric space into Euclidean space so that (1) the dimension of the host space is small, (2) the metric distortion is small. A novel self-organized, cross-validated clustering algorithm is then applied to the embedded space with Euclidean distances. We monitor the validity of our clustering by randomly splitting the data into two parts and performing an hierarchical clustering algorithm independently on each part. At every level of the hierarchy we cross-validate the clusters in one part with the clusters in the other. The resulting hierarchical tree of clusters offers a new representation of protein sequences and families, which compares favorably with the most updated classifications based on functional and structural data about proteins. Some of the known families clustered into well distinct clusters. Motifs and domains such as the zinc finger, EF hand, homeobox, EGF-like and others are automatically correctly identified, and relations between protein families are revealed by examining the splits along the tree. This clustering leads to a novel representation of protein families, from which functional biological kinship of protein families can be deduced, as demonstrated for the transporter family. Finally, we introduce a new concise representation for complete proteins that is very useful in presenting multiple alignments, and in searching for close relatives in the database. The self-organization method presented is very general and applies to any data with a consistent and computable measure of similarity between data items."

The models are trained on a family of protein or nucleic acid sequences using an expectation-maximization algorithm and a variety of algorithmic heuristics. A trained model can then be used to both generate multiple alignments and search databases for new members of the family. SAM is written in the C programming language for Unix machines and MasPar parallel computers, and includes extensive documentation.

Their so-called Fisher kernel has been combined with discriminative classifiers such as support vector machines and applied successfully in, for example, DNA and protein analysis. Whereas the Fisher kernel is calculated from the marginal log-likelihood, we propose the TOP kernel derived from tangent vectors of posterior log-odds. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework on feature extractors from probabilistic models and use it for analyzing the TOP kernel. In experiments, our new discriminative TOP kernel compares favorably to the Fisher kernel."

The trained HMM can then be used for discrimination or multiple alignment. The basic mathematical description of an HMM and its expectation-maximization training procedure is relatively straightforward. In this paper, we review the mathematical extensions and heuristics that move the method from the theoretical to the practical. We then experimentally analyze the effectiveness of model regularization, dynamic model modification and optimization strategies. Finally it is demonstrated on the SH2 domain how a domain can be found from unaligned sequences using a special model type. The experimental work was completed with the aid of the Sequence Alignment and Modeling software suite."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMM training methods.

Unfortunately, training sets are frequently biased toward one subgroup of sequences, leading to an insufficiently general model. This work evaluates sequence weighting methods based on the maximum-discrimination idea.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne good method scales sequence weights by an exponential that ranges between 0.1 for the best scoring sequence and 1.0 for the worst. Experiments with a curated data set show that while training with one or two sequences performed worse than single-sequence Probabilistic Smith-Waterman, training with five or ten sequences reduced errors by 20% and 51%, respectively.

When given an HMM, our method sets a function that corresponds to the product of a difference between the observed and the desired likelihoods for each training sequence, and using a gradient descent algorithm, trains the HMM parameters so that the function should be minimized. This method allows us to use not only the examples belonging to a class that should be represented by the HMM, but also the examples not belonging to the class, i.e., negative examples. We evaluated our method in a series of experiments based on a type of cross-validation, and compared the results with those of two existing methods. Experimental results show that our method greatly reduces the discrimination errors made by the other two methods. We conclude that both the use of negative examples and our method of using negative examples are useful for training HMMs in discriminating unknown sequences."

                "text": "MOTIVATION\nStatistical sequence comparison techniques, such as hidden Markov models and generalized profiles, calculate the probability that a sequence was generated by a given model. Log-odds scoring is a means of evaluating this probability by comparing it to a null hypothesis, usually a simpler statistical model intended to represent the universe of sequences as a whole, rather than the group of interest. Such scoring leads to two immediate questions: what should the null model be, and what threshold of log-odds score should be deemed a match to the model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThis paper analyses these two issues experimentally. Within the context of the Sequence Alignment and Modeling software suite (SAM), we consider a variety of null models and suitable thresholds. Additionally, we consider HMMer's log-odds scoring and SAM's original Z-scoring method. Among the null model choices, a simple looping null model that emits characters according to the geometric mean of the character probabilities in the columns modeled by the hidden Markov model (HMM) performs well or best across all four discrimination experiments."
