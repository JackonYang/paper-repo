                "text": "The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges, and cones. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

Then, urban pictures are evaluated according to their degree of verticalness and natural scenes, according to their degree of openness.

Most solutions proposed so far such as those based on color histograms and local texture statistics cannot capture a scene's global configuration, which is critical in perceptual judgments of scene similarity. We present a novel approach, \"configural recognition\", for encoding scene class structure. The approach's main feature is its use of qualitative spatial and photometric relationships within and across regions in low resolution images. The emphasis on qualitative measures leads to enhanced generalization abilities and the use of low-resolution images renders the scheme computationally efficient. We present results on a large database of natural scenes. We also describe how qualitative scene concepts may be learned from examples."

Specifically we seek to understand the structure of color cues that allows the express recognition of scene gists. Using the L*a*b* color space we examined the conditions under which chromatic cues concur with brightness to allow a viewer to recognize scenes at a glance. Using different methods, Experiments 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that colors do contribute when they are diagnostic (i.e., predictive) of a scene category. Experiment 3 examined the structure of colored cues at different spatial scales that are responsible for the effects of color diagnosticity reported in Experiments 1 and 2. Together, the results suggest that colored blobs at a coarse spatial scale concur with luminance cues to form the relevant spatial layout that mediates express scene recognition."

Knowing the context of a scene, a retrieval system may compute its semantic category in advance and filter out scenes belonging to irrelevant classes. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce a computational approach which classifies and organises real-world scenes along broad semantic axes. Fundamental to our approach is the computation of global spectral templates providing a continuous organisation of scenes between two categories. These templates encode the structure which is discriminant between two categories. We propose a hierarchical procedure of two stages, that organises images along three semantic axis. Firstly, all the scenes are classified according to an Artificial to Natural axis. Then, natural scenes are organised along the Open to Closed axis whereas artificial environments are classified according to the Expanded to Enclosed scenes axis."

We represent global context information in terms of the spatial layout of spectral components. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for context driven focus of attention and scale-selection on real-world scenes. Based on a simple holistic analysis of an image, the scheme is able to accurately predict object locations and sizes."

The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven \"teaser\" images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a \"quick search\" problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely \"city/suburb\" shots. The orientation features achieve agreement with human classification in 91 out of 98 of the scenes."

In this paper, we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of localized coherent regions in color and texture space. This so-called &ldquo;blobworld&rdquo; representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric"

However, the question remains of how processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment 1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale. The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

                "text": "Abstract A fundamental issue in texture analysis is that of deciding what textural features are important in texture perception, and how they are used. Experiments on human preattentive vision have identified several low-level features (such as orientation of blobs and size of line segments), which are used in texture perception. However, the question of what higher level features of texture are used has not been adequately addressed. We designed an experiment to help identify the relevant higher order features of texture perceived by humans. We used 20 subjects, who were asked to perform an unsupervised classification of 30 pictures from Brodatz\u2032s album on texture. Each subject was asked to group these pictures into as many classes as desired. Both hierarchical cluster analysis and nonparametric multidimensional scaling (MDS) were applied to the pooled similarity matrix generated from the subjects\u2032 groupings. A surprising outcome is that the MDS solutions fit the data very well. The stress in the two-dimensional case is 0.10, and the stress in the three-dimensional case is 0.045. We rendered the original textures in these coordinate systems, and interpreted the (rotated) axes. It appears that the axes in the 2D case correspond to periodicity versus irregularity, and directionality versus nondirectionality. In the 3D case, the third dimension represents the structural complexity of the texture. Furthermore, the clusters identified by the hierarchical cluster analysis remain virtually intact in the MDS solution. The results of our experiment indicate that people use three high-level features for texture perception. Future studies are needed to determine the appropriateness of these high-level features for computational texture analysis and classification."

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."

Identification is much faster when a verbal cue is provided, showing that poor visibility is not the cause of this difficulty. Identification is also faster for objects considered to be important in the scene. These results support the idea that observers never form a complete, detailed representation of their surroundings. In addition, the results indicate that attention is required to perceive change, and that in the absence of localized motion signals, attention is guided on the basis of high-level interest."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

Since measurements made near to each other in the visual field are more correlated than measurements made at a distance, the degree of correlation can be used as an estimate of the distance between two measurements and can therefore be used to calibrate a roughly organized spatial representation. We therefore explored the hypothesis that low level spatial representations are calibrated using a signal based on image intensity correlation. If the visual system uses input statistics to calibrate its spatial representation, then any distortions and anisotropies in these input statistics should be mirrored by distortions in the representation of space. To test the psychological implications of this hypothesis, a collection of 81 images of open and urban landscapes were used to estimate the degree of correlation between image intensity measurement pairs as a function of both distance and orientation. Doing this we show that a system that used the statistics measured to calibrate its representation would show: 1. (1) a horizontal-vertical illusion; 2. (2) the magnitude of this illusion would depend on the amount of open and urban landscapes in the environment; 3. (3) there would be a nontrivial relationship between line orientation and judged length. Analogues of all these distortions and regularities can be found in the psychophysical literature on distance estimation. This gives strength to the proposal that spatial representations are calibrated using input statistics."

Those probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition and coding.

Different groups of participants placed pictures into groups however they wished, described the resulting clusters and multidimensional scaling dimensions, identified the objects or surfaces depicted in the pictures, and ranked the pictures along several hypothesized attribute-based dimensions. Results indicate that similarity is context dependent, that natural textures seem to be organized according to family resemblances, and that a dimensional model is inappropriate. These outcomes suggest that models of preattentive segregation and attentive cognition may be incommensurable."

Using this algorithm we have constructed an image database system which can perform example based retrieval on large image databases. Using carefully constructed target sets, which limit variation to only a single visual characteristic, retrieval rates are quantitatively compared to those of standard methods."

The extent to which the measures approximate visual perception was investigated in the form of texture similarity measurements. These results were also encouraging, although not as good as in the rank ordering of the textures. The differences may be due to the complex mechanism of human usage of multiple cues.

We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

Using binary Bayesian classifiers, we attempt to capture high level concepts from low level image features under the constraint that the test image does belong to one of the classes of interest. Specifically, we consider the hierarchical classification of vacation images; at the highest level, images are classified into indoor/outdoor classes, outdoor images are further classified into city/landscape classes, and finally, a subset of landscape images is classified into sunset, forest, and mountain classes. We demonstrate that a small codebook (the optimal size of codebook is selected using a modified MDL criterion) extracted from a vector quantizer can be used to estimate the class-conditional densities of the observed features needed for the Bayesian methodology. On a database of 6931 vacation photographs, our system achieved an accuracy of 90.5% for indoor vs. outdoor classification, 95.3% for city vs. landscape classification, 96.6% for sunset vs. forest and mountain classification, and 95.5% for forest vs. mountain classification. We further develop a learning paradigm to incrementally train the classifiers as additional training samples become available and also show preliminary results for feature size reduction using clustering techniques."

Each image is automatically segmented into regions (\"blobs\") with associated color and texture descriptors. Queryingi s based on the attributes of one or two regions of interest, rather than a description of the entire image. In order to make large-scale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions usinga tree. Because indexing in the high-dimensional feature space is computationally prohibitive, we use a lower-rank approximation to the high-dimensional distance. Experiments show encouraging results for both queryinga nd indexing."

In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

When the patches were large relative to the image size, the appearance of the reconstructed image was similar to that of the image from which the phase information had been derived, in agreement with previous reports of phase-dominance in the global Fourier Transform. However, when the patch size was made sufficiently small, the appearance of reconstructed images was dominated by amplitude rather than phase. This was not simply due to the DC component of the amplitude spectrum. Prior low-pass filtering of the images enhanced the dominance of amplitude information in the patchwise transform. We conclude that patchwise-reconstructed images contain two quite distinct kinds of information for the human observer. The first is the positional information (\u201clocal sign\u201d) of the patches themselves; the second is the textural information within patches, which is dominated by amplitude rather than phase. The reason why the global Fourier Transform is dominated by phase is that in the absence of any other information about local sign, phase is necessary to reconstruct localised features such as edges."

Most information is gained from contrast, 1/f2 spatial frequency behaviour, and contrast as a function of orientation. Variations in spatial frequency behaviour are relatively unimportant.

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."

We have found that this can occur even when the disruption does not cover or obscure the changes. When a few small, high-contrast shapes are briefly spattered over a picture, like mudsplashes on a car windscreen, large changes can be made simultaneously in the scene without being noticed. This phenomenon is potentially important in driving, surveillance or navigation, as dangerous events occurring in full view can go unnoticed if they coincide with even very small, apparently innocuous, disturbances. It is also important for understanding how the brain represents the world."

The extent of change blindness in visual perception suggests limits on our capacity to encode, retain, and compare visual information from one glance to the next; our awareness of our visual surroundings is far more sparse than most people intuitively believe. These failures of awareness and the erroneous intuitions that often accompany them have both theoretical and practical ramifications. This article briefly summarizes the current state of research on change blindness and suggests future directions that promise to improve our understanding of scene perception and visual memory."

Workers in human vision tended to have either a neuro-physiological background (as Marr had), or a psychophysical one. In the early seventies Marr reached the conclusion that such disciplines helped to describe rather than explain the behaviour of neural cells or of subjects. He moved to the MIT artificial intelligence lab in 1973, in the hope that, by trying to build an artificial vision system, the fundamental engineering reasons for the structure of the human visual system could be discovered."
