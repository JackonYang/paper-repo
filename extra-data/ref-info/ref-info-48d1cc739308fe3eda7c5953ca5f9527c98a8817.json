Peroxidase was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus and into the superior colliculus by means of a recording micropipette. After injections at retinotopically homologous points in these two structures in separate animals, the patterns of retinal ganglion cell labeling were compared. We found that there were three populations of ganglion cells: small cells, that projected predominantly to the superior colliculus; medium\u2010sized cells, that projected predominantly to the lateral geniculate nucleus; and large cells, some of which projected to both structures, and some of which projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus alone. Quantitative studies showed that the average size of the cells in each population was smaller at the area centralis than in the periphery. These results could be directly related to physiological classifications of retinal ganglion cells proposed by other authors."

                "text": "The thalamic projection to the visual cortex has been studied in the cat and monkey by experimental light and electron microscopic techniques. After large lesions of the lateral geniculate nucleus degeneration is confined to the ipsilateral hemisphere. In the cat it is found in areas 17, 18 and 19 and in the lateral suprasylvian area, terminal degeneration occurring predominantly in layer IV, with less in layers I, III and V ; fibre degeneration crossing layers VI and V towards layer IV is coarser in area 18 than elsewhere. Some fine horizontal degenerating fibres are seen in layer I. In the monkey terminal degeneration is restricted to area 17; again degenerating fibres ascend to layer IV where there is dense fragmentation, but in contrast to the cat there is also a second, less dense, but distinct, band in layer Illb. A little fine, horizontal fibre degeneration is present in layer I and there is slight terminal degeneration in this site and in layer V. Electron microscopy shows that degenerating terminals are recognizable in the visual cortex at several stages according to survival period, but that most stages can exist simultaneously in any one site, and that all are associated with asymmetrical membrane thickenings. Mapping of electron microscopic sections confirms the laminar pattern seen with the light microscope. In area 17 of the cat and monkey and in area 19 of the cat over 80% of degenerating terminals end on dendritic spines, the rest making synaptic contact mainly with dendritic shafts, and very few with the soma of stellate cells, but in area 18 some 10 % are related to stellate cell bodies. In layer IV of all areas degenerating terminals tend to occur in clusters which are separated by approximately 100 \u03bcm. Where degenerating thalamic afferents end on cell somata or varicose dendrites almost all are identifiable as derived from stellate cells. Although it is difficult to identify positively the parent dendrites bearing the spines which receive the majority of the thalamo-cortical afferents, it is suggested that some, at least, of them may also originate from stellate cells."

These three neuron groups show different distributions in depth from pia to white matter and differ in their relationship to zones of concentrated termination of geniculo\u2010cortical axons. The neuron type most closely related to the laminae receiving a heavy geniculo\u2010cortical projection is the spinous stellate cell. This cell type is restricted to lamina IV. Included in this zone is the broadest band of geniculo\u2010cortical axon projection (lamina IVC), the horizontal fiber band (lamina IVB) comprising the major portion of the stria of Gennari (receiving little or no thalamic projection) and the narrow band of thalamo\u2010cortical fiber termination which occurs superficial to the stria of Gennari (lamina IVA). Pyramidal neuron cell bodies are almost totally excluded from lamina IVC and the apical dendrites of lower pyramidal neurons bear many fewer spines in lamina IVC than in laminae V and VI. The basal dendrites of upper pyramidal cells spread superficial and deep to lamina IVA rather than within it. Spine\u2010free stellate neurons occur at all cortical levels and sparselyspined varieties have not been impregnated in lamina IV, but occur in the other laminae."

Following lesions which are limited to area 17, the medium and small cells of the main laminae of the nucleus degenerate; damage restricted to area 18 does not result in any localized, severe degeneration, but combined destruction of areas 17 and 18 causes all the cells\u2014large, medium and small\u2014of the main laminae and the central interlaminar nucleus to degenerate. Cellular change in the medial interlaminar nucleus is only found after involvement of area 19. When the cortex of the middle suprasylvian gyrus is removed in addition to these areas the degeneration in the lateral geniculate nucleus is much more severe, and there is loss of the laminar pattern due to severe gliosis in the central interlaminar nucleus. There is a well-defined topical organization in the geniculo-cortical projection, and in the antero-posterior dimension it is the same to all areas of the visual cortex, anterior parts of the nucleus projecting anteriorly and posterior parts posteriorly. Medial parts of the main laminae are related to the lateral part of area 17 and to the medial part of area 18, and lateral parts of the laminae project to the medial part of area 17 and to the lateral part of area 18. After partial lesions which involve both areas 17 and 18 the cellular degeneration affects the laminae differentially along their antero-posterior extent, that in lamina A being the most anterior and that in lamina B the most posterior; in sagittal sections such a band, or column, of degeneration passes from antero-superior to postero-inferior at right angles to the plane of the laminae."

Following the injection of 3H\u2010proline or 3H\u2010leucine into the LGNv of the rat, label transported in the rapid phase of axonal flow was found bilaterally in the olivary pretectal nuclei, the lateral terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system, and the ventral portion of the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, and ipsilaterally in the rostrolateral portion of the superior colliculus. Since these regions are known to receive a direct projection from the retina, comparisons have been made of the distribution of silver grains in autoradiographs of each region following injections of 3H\u2010proline into the eye and into the LGNv; in every nuclear region except the superior colliculus the grain distributions were found to overlap precisely and, in the suprachiasmatic nuclei there also appears to be a similarity in the relative intensity of the input to the nuclei on the two sides. In the superior colliculus, the retinal fibers end mainly within the more superficial laminae, whereas those from the LGNv are distributed mainly to the deeper layers where they overlap the projection from the striate and peristriate cortex. The LGNv has also been found to project to the zona incerta on the same side and to the contralateral LGNv, In the cat a similar set of projections to the lateral terminal nuclei of the accessory optic tract, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and the pretectal areas of both sides has been found, together with a projection to the ipsilateral superior colliculus and the zona incerta of both sides. No evidence could be found in either species for a projection from the LGNv to the visual cortex."

This claim was based on lesions made by a particular stereotaxic approach to the LGN, and we thought it worthwhile to see whether a different stereotaxic approach, which avoided the corpus callosum, would give the same result. We found no evidence of a crossed geniculo-striate projection in either cat or monkey, but in the course of this work made the unexpected finding that the LGN in the cat projects to three separate ipsi-lateral areas of neo-cortex. These comprise visual areas I and II and the lateral part of the middle suprasylvian gyrus. Visual areas I and II have been shown to correspond to areas 17 and 18 of Otsuka & Hassler (1962), by Bilge, Seneviratne & Whitteridge (1963) and Hubel & Wiesel (1965). We have not found these cytoarchitectonic boundaries sufficiently well defined to be useful for localizing the degenerated projections. Various control lesions have been made to determine whether the projections to visual area IL and the suprasylvian gyrus arise in the LGN or in neighbouring structures."

The two most massive connections originate mainly from layer III. These are the interlaminar fibers terminating in the underlying layer V, and the systematically arranged projection upon area 18. Another cortical projection upon a narrow region in the superior temporal sulcus originates mainly from the infragranular layers, from which originate also the fibers passing to three subcortical structures, viz. the colliculus superior, the medial pulvinar and the griseum pontis. These subcortical projections are sparse compared to the interlaminar and cortico\u2010cortical connections. In particular, no evidence was obtained that the lateral geniculate nucleus receives fibers from the lateral striate cortex. Lesions injuring the white matter, however, produced, in addition, anterograde degeneration in the nucleus praetectalis, three pulvinar nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the pregeniculate nucleus. This degeneration must have resulted from the interruption of fibers originating in areas other than the lateral striate cortex, and passing beneath the site of the lesion."

                "text": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and interconnexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

He described a woman suffering from blindness of the lower left quadrants of both visual fields who was subsequently found to have a lesion limited to the dorsal half of the right LGN. Actually these early observations are not in accord with the later experimental studies on primates by Brouwer and subsequent workers (see below). Further early human clinico-pathological observations were made by Wilbrand & Saenger (1904), Ronne (1913, 1914) and Winkler (1912), but the extreme rarity of sufficiently restricted lesions, particularly in the nucleus itself, made it unlikely that the details of the retinotopic projection in the LGN would be unravelled in this way. By enucleating the eye of a cat and studying the distribution of the secondary degeneration in each LGN, Minkowski (1913) provided the first direct experimental evidence that the crossed and uncrossed optic fibres were distributed differently in the nucleus (cf. Minkowski, 1920) and that the binocular part of a visual field projected only to the medial part. The first detailed study of the retinotopic projection in the LGN was, however, carried out by Brouwer and his colleagues (Brouwer, Zeeman & Houwer, 1923). By making small retinal lesions and subsequently studying the degenerating fibres in Marchi preparations they established the quadrantic projections ofthe retina in the rabbit and cat and the quadrantic and intraquandrantic projections of the central and peripheral retinal segments in the monkey (Brouwer & Zeeman, 1925, 1926; Overbosch, 1927). Further details in respect to the monkey were added by Brody (1934), Penman"

                "text": "In submammalian vertebrates the optic tectum, a structure homologous with the mammalian superior colliculus, is the primary way-station of the fibers of the optic tract. As such, it is assumed to be of central significance in the coordination of visually-guided behavior (Huber and Crosby, '33; Ariens Kappers, Huber and Crosby, '36) . Ascending the evolutionary scale, the superior colliculus of mammals receives fewer and fewer fibers from the optic tract, as an increasing proportion of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus (Polyak, '57). In spite of this apparent comparative decline, the size and complexity of the mammalian superior colliculus (Huber and Crosby, '43) suggests that it is by no means a vestigial structure of little functional importance. The fiber projections of the superior colliculus have been investigated by means of several staining techniques (e.g., Golgi, Weigert, Marchi) in a variety of mammalian species, including man (Tsai, '25, in opossum; Held, 1890, 1892, 1893, Papez and Freeman, '30, in rat; Szent6gothai-Schimert, '41, in mouse; Cajal, 1896, Muenzer and Wiener, '02, Lewandowsky, '04, De Lange, '10, Nishikawa, '23, in rabbit; Held, 1890, 1892, 1893, Bechterew, 1897, Tschermak, 1898, Redlich, 1899, Probst, 1900, Collier and Buzzard, '01, Crosby and Henderson, '48, in monkey; and Held, 1890, 1892, 1893, Bechterew, 1897, Collier and Buzzard, '01, Tsuchida, '06, in man). Most of these investigators were concerned largely, or exclusively, with the descending fiber projections of the superior colliculus, and their data indicate numerous discrepancies. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to determine both the descending and ascending projections of the superior colliculus in the cat by means of the Nauta-Gygax technique, following localized stereotaxic lesions in the superior colliculus."

Most units responded either feebly or not at all to stimulation of the retina with diffuse light, but gave brisk responses to stationary or moving restricted spots of light. Responses to moving spots often varied with the direction of movement. It was clear that such responses must be the result of complex integrative mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to find out whether similar responses occur in retinal ganglion cells or cells of the dorsal lateral geniculate body. Lateral geniculate units have not previously been studied with restricted light stimulation, and although the cat's retinal ganglion cell has been extensively investigated by Kuffler and his co-workers (Kuffler, 1953; iKuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957), responses to moving spots were not examined. Thus it has not been possible to say whether the complex activity of cortical units originates in the cortex itself, or at lower levels. Methods for stereotaxic depth recordings in the unanaesthetized unrestrained animal were developed in order to make cortical and depth studies under similar conditions. These techniques make it possible to record from single units from virtually any part of the brain of the freely moving animal."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15).

After injection of HRP into the chick optic tectum, it was taken up by axon terminals and unmyelinated axons as well as by other processes and cell bodies of the outer tectal layers. Subsequently the HRP was obseved in vesicles, multivesicular bodies, cup\u2010shaped organelles and small tubules within axons in the stratum opticum, optic tract, optic nerve and optic fiber layer of the retina with accumulation in the retinal ganglion cell bodies. Pinocytosis of extracellular HRP along the axon shaft was rare. After a short postinjection interval, HRP was found in organelles within the axons of the optic nerve but not in the extracellular spaces. After larger injections or longer postinjection intervals, extracellular HRP diffused from the injection site to the back of the eye, but none was found in the extracellular spaces of the retina; ganglion cells were the only cells of the retina which contained HRP product. HRP disappeared from the cell bodies 3\u20134 days after transport. These findings suport the concept of intraaxonal retrograde movement of HRP."

Pyramidal neurons have a characteristically triangular perikaryon with a high content of ribonucleoprotein consisting mainly of free ribosomes; the nucleus usually shows a single small indentation. Nonpyramidal neurons, which may be large or small, have a higher concentration of all intracytoplasmic organelles and particularly of long cisternae of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum forming Nissl bodies. The nucleus is often deeply indented and crenellated. The two cell types differ also in the nature of their dendritic ramifications and particularly in their synaptic relationships. The majority of axon terminals ending on pyramidal neurons contact dendritic spines and relatively few end on the shafts of dendrites or on the perikaryon. Synapses on spines are typically of the type in which the synaptic thickenings are asymmetrical and the synaptic vesicles spherical. Such synapses, even when they occur on the shafts of pyramidal cell dendrites, are usually associated with a \u2018spine apparatus\u2019. Most of the few synapses on the dendritic shafts and somata of pyramidal cells are associated with symmetrical membrane contacts and small, flattened or pleomorphic vesicles. Terminals of this type are commonly en passant endings of long, thin unmyelinated axons oriented vertically or transversely within the cortex. The somata and the usually irregular dendrites of non-pyramidal neurons are typically covered in axon terminals most of which contain flattened vesicles and end in symmetrical complexes, but a few may contain spherical vesicles and end asymmetrically. The axon hillocks and initial segments of both types of cell are postsynaptic to axon terminals containing small, flattened vesicles and ending symmetrically."

After intraocular injections in the young chick, the peroxidase is transported centripetally along efferent axons, and is concentrated in cell bodies within the isthmo-optic nucleus. This retrograde movement of protein from axon terminal to cell body suggests a possible mechanism by which neurons respond to their target areas."

                "text": "When the nerves of isolated frog sartorius muscles were stimulated at 10 Hz, synaptic vesicles in the motor nerve terminals became transiently depleted. This depletion apparently resulted from a redistribution rather than disappearance of synaptic vesicle membrane, since the total amount of membrane comprising these nerve terminals remained constant during stimulation. At 1 min of stimulation, the 30% depletion in synaptic vesicle membrane was nearly balanced by an increase in plasma membrane, suggesting that vesicle membrane rapidly moved to the surface as it might if vesicles released their content of transmitter by exocytosis. After 15 min of stimulation, the 60% depletion of synaptic vesicle membrane was largely balanced by the appearance of numerous irregular membrane-walled cisternae inside the terminals, suggesting that vesicle membrane was retrieved from the surface as cisternae. When muscles were rested after 15 min of stimulation, cisternae disappeared and synaptic vesicles reappeared, suggesting that cisternae divided to form new synaptic vesicles so that the original vesicle membrane was now recycled into new synaptic vesicles. When muscles were soaked in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this tracerfirst entered the cisternae which formed during stimulation and then entered a large proportion of the synaptic vesicles which reappeared during rest, strengthening the idea that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface was retrieved as cisternae which subsequently divided to form new vesicles. When muscles containing HRP in synaptic vesicles were washed to remove extracellular HRP and restimulated, HRP disappeared from vesicles without appearing in the new cisternae formed during the second stimulation, confirming that a one-way recycling of synaptic membrane, from the surface through cisternae to new vesicles, was occurring. Coated vesicles apparently represented the actual mechanism for retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasma membrane, because during nerve stimulation they proliferated at regions of the nerve terminals covered by Schwann processes, took up peroxidase, and appeared in various stages of coalescence with cisternae. In contrast, synaptic vesicles did not appear to return directly from the surface to form cisternae, and cisternae themselves never appeared directly connected to the surface. Thus, during stimulation the intracellular compartments of this synapse change shape and take up extracellular protein in a manner which indicates that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface during exocytosis is retrieved by coated vesicles and recycled into new synaptic vesicles by way of intermediate cisternae."

Zur Frage der Variationsbreite der Windungen der Hemisphare, wurden 84 weitere Katzengehirne makroskopisch uberpruft. \n \n \n \n \n2. \n \nDie untersuchten Rindenfelder des Katzengehirns weisen unterschiedliche charakteristische cyto- und myeloarchitektonische Strukturen auf. Das spezifische Merkmal der Area striata ist die Gliederung der besonders breiten IV. Schicht (Lamina granularis interna) in zwei Unterschichten (IVa + b und IVc) (bistriare Form des Calcarinatypus nach Brodmann), die Pragnanz der VI. Schicht und die Schmalheit und Verschmelzung der II. und III. Schicht. \n \nIn der Area occipitalis ist die III. Schicht sehr breit und in zwei Unterschichten (IIIa und IIIb) differenziert, wobei nur die Unterschicht IIIb grose Pyramidenzellen aufweist. \n \nDagegen zeigt die Area praeoccipitalis keine spezifischen Besonderheiten, auser der hellen kleinzelligen IIIa und einzelnen sehr grosen Pyramidenzellen in der V. \n \n \n \n \n3. \n \nDie Areae striata, occipitalis und praeoccipitalis haben im Katzengehirn folgenden Sitz und Lagebeziehungen: Die Area striata nimmt auf der medialen Hemispharenflache den Gyrus splenialis, suprasplenialis, postsplenialis und auf der Konvexitat einen medialen Streifen des Gyrus lateralis und den Gyrus postlateralis ein. Die Area occipitalis befindet sich nur auf der Konvexitat in der Mitte des Gyrus lateralis, direkt lateral an die Area striata anschliesend, und erstreckt sich in den Furchengrund des Sulcus postlateralis. Die Area praeoccipitalis umgibt sowohl die Area striata als auch die Area occipitalis. Sie besetzt die mediale Wand und den Grund des Sulcus lateralis sowie den Grund des Sulcus splenialis, oft aber auch einen Teil des Gyrus suprasplenialis posterior. \n \n \n \n \n4. \n \nDie Gyri lateralis und postlateralis zeigen makroskopisch Variationen, die in vier Haupttypen eingeteilt werden. Der haufigste Typ I besitzt einen Gyrus lateralis ohne Langsfurche. Beim II. Typ, der eine tiefe zusatzliche Langsfurche (Sulcus accessorius intralateralis) im Gyrus lateralis aufweist, erscheint die Area occipitalis an der Oberflache schmaler, obwohl die absolute Breite der Area occipitalis infolge ihrer Ausdehnung in dieser Furche gleich ist wie bei den Fallen ohne zusatzliche Furche. \n \n \n \n \n5. \n \nDie Topographie der Areae striata, occipitalis und praeoccipitalis hat im Katzenhirn folgende Besonderheiten: 1. die Area striata breitet sich weiter rostralwarts aus, 2. die Area occipitalis befindet sich nur auf der Konvexitat und 3. die Area praeoccipitalis umgibt die Areae striata und occipitalis kontinuierlich. \n \n \n \n \n6. \n \nDie Besonderheiten der Lageverhaltnisse der Areae striata und occipitalis, die anders sind als meist angenommen, sollten bei physiologischen und mikrophysiologischen Untersuchungen berucksichtigt werden. Der auffallige Faserreichtum und die starke Differenzierung der Area occipitalis wird im Zusammenhang mit der Frage des Rindenfeldes der optischen Wahrnehmung hervorgehoben."
