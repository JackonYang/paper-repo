Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Local orientation and spatial frequencies are used as the key parameters for classifying texture. The information is obtained by creating a local multifrequency multiorientation channel decomposition of the image, with the width of each frequency band constant on a logarithmic scale. This decomposition is implemented by applying a set of Gabor-like functions that were modified to have a decreased frequency selectivity when the filter's center frequency increases. The set of filter outputs is then used to create robust texture descriptors. The segmentation algorithm uses the similarity of the descriptors to determine the existence of texture regions and to outline their border rather than concentrating on segregating the textures. The method has been applied to image containing natural textures, resulting in a good segmentation of the texture regions.<<ETX>>"

A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>"

It is based on a widely adopted human visual model which hypothesizes that the human visual system (HVS) processes input pictorial signals through a set of parallel and quasi-independent mechanisms or channels. This model is referred to as the multichannel spatial filtering model (MSFM). The core of the MSFM presently applied is the recently formulated cortical channel model (CCM), which attempts to model the process of texture feature extraction in each individual channel in the MSFM. With these models, successful algorithms for both texture classification and segmentation (texture edge detection) have been developed. The algorithm for texture feature extraction and classification is compared with the conventional benchmark, i.e., the gray-level cooccurrence matrix approach, and proves to be superior in many aspects. The algorithm for texture edge detection is tested under a variety of textured images, and good segmentation results are obtained.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "A 2D Gabor filter can be realized as a sinusoidal plane wave of some frequency and orientation within a two dimensional Gaussian envelope. Its spatial extent, frequency and orientation preferences as well as bandwidths are easily controlled by the parameters used in generating the filters. However, there is an \u201cuncertainty relation\u201d associated with linear filters which limits the resolution simultaneously attainable in space and frequency. Daugman (1985) has determined that 2D Gabor filters are members of a class of functions achieving optimal joint resolution in the 2D space and 2D frequency domains. They have also been found to be a good model for two dimensional receptive fields of simple cells in the striate cortex (Jones 1985; Jones et al. 1985).The characteristic of optimal joint resolution in both space and frequency suggests that these filters are appropriate operators for tasks requiring simultaneous measurement in these domains. Texture discrimination is such a task. Computer application of a set of Gabor filters to a variety of textures found to be preattentively discriminable produces results in which differently textured regions are distinguished by firstorder differences in the values measured by the filters. This ability to reduce the statistical complexity distinguishing differently textured region as well as the sensitivity of these filters to certain types of local features suggest that Gabor functions can act as detectors of certain \u201ctexton\u201d types. The performance of the computer models suggests that cortical neurons with Gabor like receptive fields may be involved in preattentive texture discrimination."

In unsupervised pattern recognition and image segmentation applications, clustering techniques play an important role. The squared-error clustering technique is the most popular one among different clustering techniques. Due to the iterative nature of the squared-error clustering, it demands substantial CPU time, even for modest numbers of patterns. Recent advances in VLSI microelectronic technology triggered the idea of implementing the squared-error clustering directly in hardware. A two-level pipelined systolic pattern clustering array is proposed in this paper. The memory storage and access schemes are designed to enable a rhythmic data flow between processing units. Each processing unit is pipelined to further enhance the system performance. The total processing time for each pass of pattern labeling and cluster center updating is essentially dominated by the time required to fetch the pattern matrix once. Detailed architectural configuration, system performance evaluation, and simulation experiments are presented. The modularity and the regularity of the system architecture make it suited for VLSI implementations."

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."
