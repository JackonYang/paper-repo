New tools are needed to help users create, manage, and retrieve images from these collections. We are developing QBIC (query by image content), a prototype system that allows a user to create and query image databases in which the image content -- the colors, textures, shapes, and layout of images and the objects they contain -- is used as the basis of queries. This paper describes two sets of algorithms in QBIC. The first are methods that allow `query by color drawing,' a form of query in which a user draws an approximate color version of an image, and similar images are retrieved. These are automatic algorithms in the sense that no user action is necessary during database population. Secondly, we describe algorithms for semi-automatic identification of image objects during database population, improving the speed and usability of this manually-intensive step. Once outlined, detailed queries on the content-properties of these individual objects can be made at query time."

Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

Classifying images into visual categories and finding objects in image databases are two major challenges in the field. This paper describes our approach toward the first of the two tasks, the generalization of which we believe will assist in the second task as well. We define a \"blob world\" representation which provides a transition from the raw pixel data to a small set of localized coherent regions in color and texture space. Learning is then utilized to extract a probabilistic interpretation of the scene. Experimental results are presented for more than 1000 images from the Corel photo collection."

We present an approach that integrates a relational database retrieval system with a color analysis technique. The Chabot project was initiated at our university to study storage and retrieval of a vast collection of digitized images. These images are from the State of California Department of Water Resources. The goal was to integrate a relational database retrieval system with content analysis techniques that would give our querying system a better method for handling images. Our simple color analysis method, if used in conjunction with other search criteria, improves our ability to retrieve images efficiently. The best result is obtained when text-based search criteria are combined with content-based criteria and when a coarse granularity is used for content analysis. >"

The grouping is represented by a graph where nodes correspond to individual elements and arcs join spatially neighboring elements. Associated with each arc is an affine map that best transforms the image patch at one location to the other. The approach we propose consists of 4 steps: (1) detecting \u201cinteresting\u201d elements in the image; (2) matching elements with their neighbors and estimating the affine transform between them; (3) growing the element to form a more distinctive unit; and (4) grouping the elements. The idea is analogous to tracking in dynamic imagery. In our context, we \u201ctrack\u201d an element to spatially neighboring locations in one image, while in temporal tracking, one would perform the search in neighboring image frames."

Computer Vision has progressed considerably over the years. From methods only applicable to simple images, it has developed to deal with increasingly complex scenes, volumes and time sequences. A substantial part of this book deals with the problem of designing models that can be used for several purposes with computer vision. These partial models have some general properties of invariance generation and generality in model generation. Signal Processing for Computer Vision is the first book to give a unified treatment of representation and filtering of higher order data, such as vectors and tensors in multidimensional space. Included is a systematic organisation for the implementation of complex models in a hierarchical modular structure and novel material on adaptive filtering using tensor data representation. Signal Processing for Computer Vision is intended for final year undergraduate and graduate students as well as engineers and researchers in the field of computer vision and image processing."

A definition of circular symmetry is given which implies detection of one-dimensionality of a 2-D image arter a coordinate transformation. The coordinate transformation is such that Archimecles' spirals map to straight lines. The Fourier transform of a circularly symmetric image, in these coordinates provides an energy concentration to a line in a certain direction. Locsl neighbourhoods consisting of one circie or sev\u00b7 era1 concentric circ!es showa concentration of energy to a line. This is alsa the case for lines with a common intersection point. These two types of circularly symmetric images map to two orthogonal lines in this special Fourier dornain. Archimedes' spirals map continuously to lines with directions between these two orthogonallines incorporating circ!es, hal f lines and spirals into the same model. Fitting a line in the least square sense in this special Fourier transform domain is shown to be possible to accomplish in the spatial domain as a convolution carried out on the partiai derivative image. The necessary filters are derived. Two algorithms based on interpretation of the error of the fitted optimal line and its orientation are implemented. ODe is dependent on the energy of the variation of the local image, the other is not. Both use the same optimal estimate of the orientation of the fitted line. Experiments are carried out utilizing the implemented algorithrns showing very good detection properties for spirals, circles, concentric circ!es, line end! and intersection point of a set of lines."

A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore, the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on synthetic and real image sequences."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."

One such representation, called layered representation, has recently been proposed. Although a number of algorithms have been developed for computing these representations, there has not been a consolidated effort into developing a precise mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper presents one such formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixture models and the minimum description length (MDL) encoding principle. The three major issues in layered motion representation are: (i) how many motion models adequately describe image motion, (ii) what are the motion model parameters, and (iii) what is the spatial support layer for each motion model.<<ETX>>"

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on ..."

In this book Professor Ripley brings together two crucial ideas in pattern recognition; statistical methods and machine learning via neural networks. Unifying principles are brought to the fore, and the author gives an overview of the state of the subject. Many examples are included to illustrate real problems in pattern recognition and how to overcome them.This is a self-contained account, ideal both as an introduction for non-specialists readers, and also as a handbook for the more expert reader."

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature."

                "text": "CANDID (comparison algorithm for navigating digital image databases) was developed to enable content-based retrieval of digital imagery from large databases using a query-by- example methodology. A user provides an example image to the system, and images in the database that are similar to that example are retrieved. The development of CANDID was inspired by the N-gram approach to document fingerprinting, where a `global signature' is computed for every document in a database and these signatures are compared to one another to determine the similarity between any two documents. CANDID computes a global signature for every image in a database, where the signature is derived from various image features such as localized texture, shape, or color information. A distance between probability density functions of feature vectors is then used to compare signatures. In this paper, we present CANDID and highlight two results from our current research: subtracting a `background' signature from every signature in a database in an attempt to improve system performance when using inner-product similarity measures, and visualizing the contribution of individual pixels in the matching process. These ideas are applicable to any histogram-based comparison technique."
