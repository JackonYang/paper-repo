Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

In this paper, we present three sophisticated neural-network classifiers to solve complex pattern recognition problems: multiple multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, hidden Markov model (HMM)/MLP hybrid classifier, and structure-adaptive self-organizing map (SOM) classifier. In order to verify the superiority of the proposed classifiers, experiments were performed with the unconstrained handwritten numeral database of Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. The three methods have produced 97.35%, 96.55%, and 96.05% of the recognition rates, respectively, which are better than those of several previous methods reported in the literature on the same database."

This approach has a number of advantages: it combines rule based (structural) and classification tests; feature extraction is inexpensive; and execution time is independent of character font and size. The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is preprocessing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number of subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number and position of the complementary character, etc. Finally, an artificial neural network is used for character classification. The algorithm was implemented on a powerful MS-DOS microcomputer and written in C."

A document image is segmented into rectangular areas. Each of which contains a cluster of image elements. A layered feed-forward neural network is then used to classify each segmented area using the histograms of gradient vector directions and luminance levels. A high classification performance was obtained, even with a small number of training samples. It is confirmed that the histograms of gradient vector directions and luminance levels are significantly effective features for the classification of the four kinds of image regions. Increasing the number of the discrimination areas improves the classification performance sufficiently even using a small number of training samples for the neural network.<<ETX>>"

The layout is described by means of a hierarchical description, the modified X-Y tree, that is derived from the classical X-Y tree segmentation algorithm taking into account cuts along lines in addition to cuts along white spaces between blocks. In order to reduce problems due to noise and the skew of the input image, the modified X-Y tree is built on top of regions extracted by a commercial OCR package. The tree is afterwards coded into a fixed-size representation that takes into account occurrences of tree patterns in the tree representing the page. Lastly, this feature vector is fed to an artificial neural network that is trained to classify document images. The system is applied to the classification of documents belonging to digital libraries. Examples of classes taken into account are \"title page\", \"index\" and \"regular page\". Many tests have been carried out on a data set of more than 600 pages from an online digital library. These tests allowed us to conclude that the use of modified X-Y trees is advantageous with respect to the classical X-Y decomposition for this classification task."

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

It also contains very rich information by encoding in one representation both the white/black distribution and the directional distance distribution.

The features extracted mainly correspond to visible characteristics of the writing, for example, the width, the slant and the height of the three main writing zones. Additionally, features based on the fractal behavior of the writing, which are correlated with the writing's legibility, are used. With these features two classifiers are applied: a k-nearest neighbor and a feedforward neural network classifier. In the experiments, 100 pages of text written by 20 different writers are used. By classifying individual text lines, an average recognition rate of 87.8% for the k-nearest neighbor and 90.7% for the neural network is measured. By a simple maximum ranking over all lines of a page, all texts are correctly assigned to the corresponding writers. Compared to these results, an average recognition rate of 98% was measured when humans assigned persons to the text lines."

Binary document images are first segmented into blocks by the constrained run-length algorithm (CRLA). The component-labeling procedure is used to label the resulting blocks. The features for each block, calculated from the coordinates of its extremities, are then fed into the input layer of a neural network for classification. Four neural networks were considered, and they include back propagation (BP), radial basis functions (RBF), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). The performance and behavior of these neural network models are analyzed and compared in terms of training times, memory requirements, and classification accuracy. The experiments carried out on a variety of medical journals show the feasibility of using the neural network approach for textual block classification and indicate that in terms of both accuracy and training time RBF should be preferred."

This general conception fails when there are no reliable physical cues for isolating the objects, such as when objects overlap. This paper describes an approach, called centered object integrated segmentation and recognition (COISR), for integrating object segmentation and recognition within a single neural network. The application is handprinted character recognition. The approach uses a backpropagation network that scans a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether it is centered over a single character or between characters. When it is centered over a character, the net classifies the character. The approach is tested on a dataset of handprinted digits and high accuracy rates are reported."

The situation arises often on the Internet, when online polls are conducted, accounts are requested, undesired email is received, and chat-rooms are spammed. The approach we use is to create a visual challenge that is easy for humans but difficult for a computer. More specifically, our challenge is to recognize a string of random distorted characters. To pass the challenge, the subject must type in the correct corresponding ASCII string. From an OCR point of view, this problem is interesting because our goal is to use the vast amount of accumulated knowledge to defeat the state of the art OCR algorithms. This is a role reversal from traditional OCR research. Unlike many other systems, our algorithm is based on the assumption that segmentation is much more difficult than recognition. Our image challenges present hard segmentation problems that humans are particularly apt at solving. The technology is currently being used in MSN's Hotmail registration system, where it has significantly reduced daily registration rate with minimal Consumer Support impact."

We present an NN classification scheme based on an enhanced multilayer perceptron (MLP) and describe an end-to-end system for form-based handprint OCR applications designed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Visual Image Processing Group. The enhancements to the MLP are based on (i) neuron activations functions that reduce the occurrences of singular Jacobians; (ii) successive regularization to constrain the volume of the weight space; and (iii) Boltzmann pruning to constrain the dimension of the weight space. Performance characterization studies of NN systems evaluated at the first OCR systems conference and the NIST form-based handprint recognition system are also summarized."

The system outputs are a set of fuzzy membership grades reflecting the degrees of an input digit string of having different lengths.

A neural network has been designed to deal with various types of touching observed frequently in numeral strings. A numeral string image is split into a number of line segments while stroke extraction is being performed and the segments are represented with straight lines. Four types of primitive are defined based on the lines and used for representing the numeral string in more abstractive way and extracting clues on touching information from the string. Potential segmentation points are located using the neural network by active interpretation of the features collected from the primitives. Also, the run-length coding scheme is employed for efficient representation and manipulation of images. On a test set collected from real mail pieces, the segmentation accuracy of 89.1% was achieved, in image level, in a preliminary experiment."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

RFasArt preserves the fine characteristics, such as modularity, stability and flexibility, of its predecessors Fuzzy ARTMAP and FasArt. In this paper, the documents are considered as pseudo-temporal sequences, and context information is exploited in an integrated form. Two working prototypes for a MIME-based mailing system and for a digital library were tested with over 90% of the recognition rate and less ambiguous decisions than in the previous systems. A manageable knowledge base was constructed using fuzzy rules that were easily interpretable by human users, and examples of rule creation and fusion are shown."

Binary document images are first segmented into blocks by the constrained run-length algorithm (CRLA). The component-labeling procedure is used to label the resulting blocks. The features for each block, calculated from the coordinates of its extremities, are then fed into the input layer of a neural network for classification. Four neural networks were considered, and they include back propagation (BP), radial basis functions (RBF), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). The performance and behavior of these neural network models are analyzed and compared in terms of training times, memory requirements, and classification accuracy. The experiments carried out on a variety of medical journals show the feasibility of using the neural network approach for textual block classification and indicate that in terms of both accuracy and training time RBF should be preferred."

The document understanding process is divided into three procedures: the first is the recognition of document structures from a two-dimensional point of view; the second is the recognition of item relationships from a one-dimensional point of view; and the third is the recognition of characters from a zero-dimensional point of view. The procedure for recognizing structures plays the most important role in document understanding. This procedure extracts and classifies the logical item blocks from paper-based documents distinctly.We discuss the structure recognition methods for three classes of documents: 1) table-form documents, filled-in forms, cataloging lists, etc. \u2014 each item block is surrounded by horizontal and vertical line segments; 2) library cataloging cards, name cards, letters, etc. \u2014 each item block is separated by spaces; 3) newspapers, pamphlets, etc. \u2014 each item block is constructed hierarchically and by combining under roughly specified layouts. The structure recognition procedure is characterized by individual recognition methods: in class 1 documents, binary trees indicating the connective relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are surrounded by line segments; in class 2 documents, binary trees defining the spatial and geometric relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are separated by spaces; and in class 3 documents, composition rules specifying the constructive relationships among neighboring item blocks, which are represented by adjacent relationship graphs. The methods are effective under the knowledge-based frame-work and are integrated complementarily from the top-down (model-driven) and bottom-up (data-driven) approaches. Of course, the integration means vary according to document classes."

Four such experiments were conducted and the results were compared to a conventional nearest-neighbor classifier trained on the same data. Results indicate that neural networks and nearest-neighbor classifiers perform at near the same level of accuracy. For each task, a critical number of neurons can be determined experimentally which yields highest recognition accuracy with least hardware. This number can also measure the classification efficiency of the input feature encoder. Several techniques for optimizing the performance of layered networks are discussed. A constant level added to the input signal biases patterns into the range where the learning rate is highest. Eliminating near-zero weights after learning results in little loss of accuracy. Finally, a novel handwriting encoder is described. >"

An efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis, and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables, images, drawings, and rulers. We use the traditional bottom-up approach based on the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval, transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation, segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2550/spl times/3300 image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise."

Thanks to the reformulation of the SAE problem in the framework of angle of arrival theory, a fast and accurate method is presented that is based on the cooperation of two neural networks. The first neural net is a three-layer perceptron receiving on input the values of the correlation matrix of the signals; the output is a \"rough\" estimation of the angle to estimate. This gross estimate is then used to initialize the weights of a second multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The second MLP is built in order to perform a maximum likelihood-like optimization, therefore reaching good performances. The system, though trained on simulated radar data, shows good performances on noisy handwritten texts."

It is proven that multilayer perceptrons with sigmoidal units and a number of hidden units less or equal than the number of inputs are unable to model patterns distributed in typical clusters, since these networks draw open separation surfaces in the pattern space. When using more hidden units than inputs, the separation surfaces can be closed but, unfortunately it is proven that determining whether or not a MLP draws closed separation surfaces in the pattern space is NP-hard. The major conclusion of the paper is somewhat opposite to what is believed and reported in many application papers: MLPs are definitely not adequate for applications of pattern recognition requiring a reliable rejection and, especially, they are not adequate for pattern verification tasks."

At first, logo images are converted into a structured representation based on contour trees. Recursive neural networks are then learnt using the contourtrees as inputs to the neural nets. On the other hand, the contour-tree is constructed by associating a node with each exterior or interior contour extracted from the logo instance. Nodes in the tree are labeled by a feature vector, which describes the contour by means of its perimeter, surrounded area, and a synthetic representation of its curvature plot. The contour-tree representation contains the topological structured information of logo and continuous values pertaining to each contour node. Hence symbolic and sub-symbolic information coexist in the contour-tree representation of logo image. Experimental results are reported on 40 real logos distorted with artificial noise and performance of recursive neural network is compared with another two types of neural approaches."

The segmentation operation is posed as a statistical classification task with two pattern classes: print and background. A number of classification strategies are available. All require some prior information about the distribution of gray levels for the two classes. Training (either supervised or unsupervised) is employed to form these initial density estimates. Automatic updating of the class-conditional densities is performed within subregions in the image to adapt these global density estimates to the local image area. After local class-conditional densities have been obtained, each pixel is classified within the window using several techniques: a noncontextual Bayes classifier, Besag's classifier, relaxation, Owen and Switzer's classifier, and Haslett's classifier. Four test images were processed. In two of these, the relaxation method performed best, and in the other two, the noncontextual method performed best. Automatic updating improved the results for both classifiers. >"

Then, a rule-based block classification is used for classifying each block into the text, horizontal/vertical line, graphics, or-picture type.

After the execution of the base OCR algorithm (a three-layer neural network), a linear tournament verification is executed using one-to-one small network verifiers to improve the ordering of the top candidates. Thirty-four one-to-one verifiers were developed for the uppercase English alphabet. Fourteen of these use special features; however, the rest use the same features as those in the base algorithm. On the NIST uppercase data set, the recognition rate for the new system is 95.8%, showing a 1.2% improvement over the system without verification. Although the improvement is modest, the costs in both efficiency and development effort are small.<<ETX>>"

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"

The proposed method is based on two main principles: unsupervised prototype clustering, and string encoding for efficient string matching. During indexing, a self organizing map (SOM) is trained so as to cluster together similar symbols (character-like objects) in a sub-set of the documents to be stored. By using the trained SOM the words in the whole collection can be stored and represented with a fixed-length description that can be easily compared in order to score most similar words in response to a user query. The system can be automatically adapted to different languages and font styles. The most appropriate applications are for the processing of old documents (18th and 19th Centuries) where current OCRs have more difficulties. Experimental results describe three application scenarios having various levels of difficulty for current OCR systems."

The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is based on 'visual similarity' of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier, given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of tex and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures, variations in the point size of fonts, the density of content area, and various statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples without class knowledge. In order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings."

If we analyze gray-scale images, however, specific topographic features and the variation of intensity can be observed in the character boundaries. We believe that such kinds of clues obtained from gray-scale images should be useful for efficient character segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for character segmentation and recognition which makes the best use of the characteristics of gray-scale images. In the proposed methodology, the character segmentation regions are determined by using projection profiles and topographic features extracted form gray-scale images. Then the nonlinear character segmentation path in each character segmentation region is found by using multistage graph search algorithm. Finally, in order to confirm the character segmentation paths and recognition results, recognition based segmentation method is adopted."

Assuming the features are extracted and presented as the inputs of a 3 layered perceptron classifier, we apply the five feature selection methods before/during/after neural network training in order to prune only input nodes of the neural network. Four of them are node pruning methods such as node saliency method, node sensitivity method, and two interactive pruning methods using different contribution measures. The last one is a statistical method based on principle component analysis (PCA). The first two of them prune input nodes during training whereas the last three do before/after network training. For gradient and upper down, left right hole concavity features, we perform several experiments of handwritten English alphabet and digit recognition with/without pruning using the five feature selection algorithms, respectively. The experimental results show that node saliency method outperforms the others."

The methods are useful for visual similarity based document retrieval as well as fast algorithms for initial document type classification without OCR. A novel feature set called interval encoding is introduced to capture elements of spatial layout. This feature set encodes region layout information in fixed-length vectors which can be used for fast page layout comparison. The paper describes experiments and results to rank-order a set of document pages in terms of their layout similarity to a test document. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the features derived from interval encoding in a hidden Markov model based page layout classification system that is trainable and extendible."

Numerous successful applications of classifier combination have been described in the literature. However, most of the combination algorithms neglect the fact that classifier performances are dependent on various pattern and image characteristics. More effective combination can be achieved if that dependency information is used to dynamically combine classifiers. Two types of dynamic selections are distinguished. The postconditioned selection seeks better approximation to unconditioned classifier output distribution. The preconditioned selection captures the variations in the density function of classifier outputs conditioned on the inputs. Although both types of selections have the potential to improve combination performance, we argue that preconditioned selections have lower error bounds than postconditioned selections. The difficulties of applying preconditioned selections are identifying characteristic variables and estimating their effects on classifier outputs. A solution using neural network to achieve preconditioned selection is suggested. Two examples on handprinted digit recognition are used to illustrate the potential gain."

While on-line recognition is based on pen trajectory data, off-line recognition has to rely on pixel data only. We present a comparison between an off-line and an on-line recognition system using the same databases and system design. Both systems use a sliding window technique which avoids any segmentation before recognition. The recognizer is a hybrid system containing a neural network and a hidden Markov model. New normalization and feature extraction techniques for the off-line recognition are presented, including a connectionist approach for non-linear core height estimation. Results for uppercase, cursive and mixed case word recognition are reported. Finally a system combining the on- and off-line recognition is presented."

In a previous evaluation study, the modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) proposed by Kimura et al. was shown to be superior in noncharacter resistance but inferior in classification accuracy to neural networks. This paper proposes a discriminative learning algorithm to optimize the parameters of MQDF with aim to improve the classification accuracy while preserving the superior noncharacter resistance. We refer to the resulting classifier as discriminative learning QDF (DLQDF). The parameters of DLQDF adhere to the structure of MQDF under the Gaussian density assumption and are optimized under the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion. The promise of DLQDF is justified in handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition, where the performance of DLQDF is comparable to or superior to that of neural classifiers. The results are also competitive to the best ones reported in the literature."

This paper proposes a hybrid method which combines a neural network-based de ferred segmentation scheme with conventional immediate segmentation techniques. In the deferred segmentation, a neural network is employed to distinguish single characters from composites. To find a proper vertical cut that separates a composite, a shortest-path alg~ rithm seeking minimal-penalty curved cuts is used. Integrating those components with a multiresolution neural network OCR and an efficient spelling checker, the resulting system significantly improves its ability to read omnifont document text."

A single neural network provides grapheme observation probabilities for all HMMs in order to compute the most likely word model. During the iterative EM like training of the hybrid, the HMMs provide the targets for the discriminant training of the neural network. An extension of the approach to letter models which can be concatenated in order to form word models and which allow for large vocabularies is also briefly discussed. We report results obtained on a large data base of words from French cheques, showing recognition rates close to 93% for the 30 word vocabulary relevant for French legal amounts."

These initial networks were trained and tested on clean, well-segmented images. In the real world, however, images are rarely perfect, which causes problems. For example, at one time one of our best performing digit classifiers interpreted a horizontal bar as a 2; in this example the most useful response would be to reject the image as unclassifiable. The aim of the work reported here was to train a network to reject the type of unclassifiable images (\u201crubbish\u201d) typically produced by an automatic segmenter for strings of digits (e.g., zip codes), while maintaining its performance level at classifying digits, by adding images of rubbish to the training set."

In Bayesian image analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with a prior model of label images. Following the work of Bouman and Shapiro (1994), we consider the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) as prior models. The parameters in the TSBN are trained using a maximum-likelihood objective function with the EM algorithm and the resulting model is evaluated by calculating how efficiently it codes label images. A number of authors have used Gaussian mixture models to connect the label field to the image data. We compare this approach to the scaled-likelihood method of Smyth (1994) and Morgan and Bourlard (1995), where local predictions of pixel classification from neural networks are fused with the TSBN prior. Our results show a higher performance is obtained with the neural networks. We evaluate the classification results obtained and emphasize not only the maximum a posteriori segmentation, but also the uncertainty, as evidenced e.g., by the pixelwise posterior marginal entropies. We also investigate the use of conditional maximum-likelihood training for the TSBN and find that this gives rise to improved classification performance over the ML-trained TSBN."

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."

In order to improve the performance of the proposed scheme, a nonlinear shape normalization based on dot density and three kinds of hierarchical features are introduced. For coarse classification, two kinds of classifiers are proposed. One is a hierarchical tree classifier, and the other is a SOFM/LVQ based classifier which is composed of an adaptive SOFM coarse classifier and LVQ4 language classifiers. For fine classification, an LVQ4 classifier has been adopted. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, recognition experiments with 3,367,200 characters having 7320 different classes have been carried out on a 486 DX-2 66 MHz PC. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme using an adaptive SOFM coarse classifier, LVQ4 language classifiers, and LVQ4 fine classifiers has a high recognition rate of over 98.27% and a fast execution time of more than 40 characters per second."

We adopt an explicit segmentation-based word level architecture to implement an HMM classifier. An efficient state transition model and a parameter re-estimation scheme are introduced to use non-scaled and non-normalised symbol vectors without having to label primitive vectors. This approach brings well-formed discrete signals for the variable state duration of the HMM. We also introduce a new probability measure as well as conventional schemes to combine the proposed HMMs and a general MLP. The main contributions of this model are a novel design of the segmentation-based variable length HMMs, and an efficient method of combining two distinct classifiers. Experiments have been conducted using the legal word database of CENPARMI with encouraging results."

This is an extension of previous work on recognizing isolated digits. In this architecture a single digit recognizer is replicated over the input. The output layer of the network is coupled to a Viterbi alignment module that chooses the best interpretation of the input. Training errors are propagated through the Viterbi module. The novelty in this procedure is that segmentation is done on the feature maps developed in the Space Displacement Neural Network (SDNN) rather than the input (pixel) space."

In an attempt to move toward a paperless office, large quantities of printed documents are often scanned and archived as images, without adequate index information. One way to provide traditional data-base indexing and retrieval capabilities is to fully convert the document to an electronic representation which can be indexed automatically. Unfortunately, there are many factors which prohibit complete conversion including high cost, low document quality, and the fact that many nontext components cannot be adequately represented in a converted form. In such cases, it can be advantageous to maintain a copy of and use the document in image form. In this paper, we provide a survey of methods developed by researchers to access and manipulate document images without the need for complete and accurate conversion. We briefly discuss traditional text indexing techniques on imperfect data and the retrieval of partially converted documents. This is followed by a more comprehensive review of techniques for the direct characterization, manipulation, and retrieval, of images of documents containing text, graphics, and scene images."

                "text": "Acoustic modeling in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems usually relies on hidden Markov models (HMMs) with Gaussian emission densities. HMMs suffer from intrinsic limitations, mainly due to their arbitrary parametric assumption. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to be a promising alternative in this respect, but they historically failed as a general solution to the acoustic modeling problem. This paper introduces algorithms based on a gradient-ascent technique for global training of a hybrid ANN/HMM system, in which the ANN is trained for estimating the emission probabilities of the states of the HMM. The approach is related to the major hybrid systems proposed by Bourlard and Morgan and by Bengio, with the aim of combining their benefits within a unified framework and to overcome their limitations. Several viable solutions to the \"divergence problem\"-that may arise when training is accomplished over the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion-are proposed. Experimental results in speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition over Italian digit-strings validate the novel hybrid framework, allowing for improved recognition performance over HMMs with mixtures of Gaussian components, as well as over Bourlard and Morgan's paradigm. In particular, it is shown that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) version of the algorithm yields a 46.34% relative word error rate reduction with respect to standard HMMs."

The classification engine is based on a new modular connectionist architecture, where a multilayer perceptron (MLP) acting as a classifier is properly combined with a set of autoassociators \u2013 one for each class \u2013 trained to copy the input to the output layer. The MLP-based classifier selects a small group of classes with high score, that are afterwards verified by the corresponding autoassociators. The learning samples used to train the classifiers are constructed by means of a synthetic noise generator starting from few grey level characters labeled by the user. We report experimental results for comparing three neural architectures: an MLP-based classifier, an autoassociator-based classifier, and the proposed combined architecture. The experiments show that the proposed architecture exhibits the best performance, without increasing significantly the computational burden."

Generalization results are reported as a function of training set size and network capacity. Given a large training set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For those developing hand-printed character recognition systems, these results suggest that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. Benefits of reducing the number of net connections, other than improving generalization, are discussed."

It uses typographical attributes such as ascenders, descenders and serifs obtained from a word image. The attributes are used as an input to a neural network classifier to produce the multifont classification results. It can classify 7 commonly used fonts for all point sizes from 7 to 18. The approach developed in this scheme can handle a wide range of image quality even with severely touching characters. The detection of the font can improve character segmentation as well as character recognition because the identification of the font provides information on the structure and typographical design of characters. Therefore, this multifont classification algorithm can be used for maintaining good recognition rates of a machine printed OCR system regardless of fonts and sizes. Experiments have shown that font classification accuracies reach high performance levels of about 95 percent even with severely touching characters. The technique developed for the selected 7 fonts in this paper can be applied to any other fonts."

The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

Instead of relying on an external feature extractor, the SVM receives the gray-level values of the raw pixels, as SVMs can generalize well even in high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, it is shown that SVMs can incorporate conventional texture feature extraction methods within their own architecture, while also providing solutions to problems inherent in these methods. One-against-others decomposition is adopted to apply binary SVMs to multitexture classification, plus a neural network is used as an arbitrator to make final classifications from several one-against-others SVM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in texture classification."

In optical character recognition (OCR), for instance, we know that the classification should be invariant under a set of transformations like rotation or translation. We propose a new modular classification system based on several autoassociative multilayer perceptrons which allows the efficient incorporation of such knowledge. Results are reported on the NIST database of upper case handwritten letters and compared to other approaches to the invariance problem."

The approach, called Saccade, integrates ballistic and corrective saccades (eye movements) with character recognition. A single backpropagation net is trained to make a classification decision on a character centered in its input window, as well as to estimate the distance of the current and next character from the center of the input window. The net learns to accurately estimate these distances regardless of variations in character width, spacing between characters, writing style and other factors. During testing, the system uses the net-extracted classification and distance information, along with a set of jumping rules, to jump from character to character."

However, for the case of classifying patterns which are large-set and require complex decision boundaries in high-dimensional pattern space, the greater part of conventional neural networks suffer from some of difficult problems to solve, such as the structure and size of the network, the computational complexity, and so on. In this paper, to cope with these difficulties, we propose a new self-organizing neural tree and its learning algorithm.

The outline of this method is described as follows. First, ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. After that, several lines are grouped as one to be recognised as data corresponding to a sub-form. These lines and sub-forms are both used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each feature in the input image of a form is expected to correspond to a feature in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph, where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for document images of poor quality, and also for various styles of forms."

With a filter size restriction (for example 3 by 3), each pixel in output image depends only on its (3 by 3) neighborhood of input image. Therefore, we can construct a look-up table between input and output. Each output image pixel is determined by this table. So the filter design becomes the search for the optimal look-up table. By considering the degradation condition of the input image, we provide a methodology for knowledge based look-up table design, to achieve computational tractability. The methodology can be applied iteratively so that the final output image is the input image after being transformed through successive 3 by 3 operations. An experimental protocol is developed for restoring degraded document images, and improving the corresponding recognition accuracy rates of an OCR algorithm. We present results for a set of real images which are manually ground-truthed. The performance of each filter is evaluated by the OCR accuracy."

The architecture, called fuzzy ARTMAP, achieves a synthesis of fuzzy logic and adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks by exploiting a close formal similarity between the computations of fuzzy subsethood and ART category choice, resonance, and learning. Four classes of simulation illustrated fuzzy ARTMAP performance in relation to benchmark backpropagation and generic algorithm systems. These simulations include finding points inside versus outside a circle, learning to tell two spirals apart, incremental approximation of a piecewise-continuous function, and a letter recognition database. The fuzzy ARTMAP system is also compared with Salzberg's NGE systems and with Simpson's FMMC system."

Nodes in the ARG represent the global image features, while the relations between those features are represented by attributed branches between their corresponding nodes. The extraction of ARG representation from images is achieved by a multilayer graph transducer scheme. This scheme is basically a rule-based system that uses a combination of model-driven and data-driven concepts in performing a hierarchical symbolic mapping of the image information content from the spatial-domain representation into a global representation. Further analysis and inter-pretation of the imagery data is performed on the extracted ARG representation. A distance measure between images is defined in terms of the distance between their respective ARG representations. The distance between two ARG's and the inexact matching of their respective components are calculated by an efficient dynamic programming technique. The system handles noise, distortion, and ambiguity in real-world images by two means, namely, through modeling and embedding them into the transducer's mapping rules, as well as through the appropriate cost of error-transformation for the inexact matching of the ARG image representation. Two illustrative experiments are presented to demonstrate some capabilities of the proposed system. Experiment I deals with locating objects in multiobject scenes, while Experiment II is concerned with target detection in SAR images."

To demonstrate the performance of this technique, two synthesized images containing only touching characters and two synthesized images containing only broken characters were processed.

Instead of explicitly specifying the local regularization parameter values, they are regarded as network weights which are then modified through the supply of appropriate training examples. The desired response of the network is in the form of a gray level value estimate of the current pixel using weighted order statistic (WOS) filter. However, instead of replacing the previous value with this estimate, this is used to modify the network weights, or equivalently, the regularization parameters such that the restored gray level value produced by the network is closer to this desired response. In this way, the single WOS estimation scheme can allow appropriate parameter values to emerge under different noise conditions, rather than requiring their explicit selection in each occasion. In addition, we also consider the separate regularization of edges and textures due to their different noise masking capabilities. This in turn requires discriminating between these two feature types. Due to the inability of conventional local variance measures to distinguish these two high variance features, we propose the new edge-texture characterization (ETC) measure which performs this discrimination based on a scalar value only. This is then incorporated into a fuzzified form of the previous neural network which determines the degree of membership of each high variance pixel in two fuzzy sets, the EDGE and TEXTURE fuzzy sets, from the local ETC value, and then evaluates the appropriate regularization parameter by appropriately combining these two membership function values."

The history, origination, operating characteristics, and basic theory of several supervised neural-network training algorithms (including the perceptron rule, the least-mean-square algorithm, three Madaline rules, and the backpropagation technique) are described. The concept underlying these iterative adaptation algorithms is the minimal disturbance principle, which suggests that during training it is advisable to inject new information into a network in a manner that disturbs stored information to the smallest extent possible. The two principal kinds of online rules that have developed for altering the weights of a network are examined for both single-threshold elements and multielement networks. They are error-correction rules, which alter the weights of a network to correct error in the output response to the present input pattern, and gradient rules, which alter the weights of a network during each pattern presentation by gradient descent with the objective of reducing mean-square error (averaged over all training patterns). >"

The cluster detection is performed by a competitive neural network or the k-means algorithm, followed by an algorithm which obtains connected clusters. The cluster fusion involves a procedure that is based on the theory of equivalence relations. Proofs are given for the significant properties that we have found. It is not necessary to specify the number of regions in advance, which is a significant improvement over the standard competitive-style strategies. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of this method for some images."

In this kind of document, the extraction of some information fields cannot take place without having detected the corresponding instruction fields, which are only constrained to range in given domains. We propose modeling the document's layout by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields. This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms, based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with connectionist models. Experimental results are given in order to assess the actual performance of the system."

Although storage capacitates increase permanently, image file sizes are of high interest in the area of image transmission, e.g. in the Internet the number of bytes transmitted is directly correlated to the costs and the time consumption for the transmission. Furthermore, because of the extremely high amount of data, in video processing efficient compression methods are always point of interest. In this contribution a new approach of image coding is presented, which uses the relatively new paradigm of cellular neural networks (CN). CNN are massively parallel computing arrays which are perfectly suited for high speed image processing. Furthermore, their robustness is another outstanding feature of CNN hardware implementations, so that they predominate many other neural network implementations."

Among these are iterative increasing filters for designing optimal increasing filters in stages, and paired- representation filters, in which a nonincreasing filter is represented as a union of anti-extensive and extensive increasing filters. The present paper applies these filters in three different modalities for digital document enhancement. Iterative design is illustrated in the context of document restoration for dilated, background-noise images; iterative, paired design is illustrate in for restoration of edge-degraded characters; and paired design is used for integer resolution conversion."

The proposed unsupervised competitive neural network, called weighted centroid neural network (WCNN), utilizes the characteristics of image blocks from edge areas. The mean/residual VQ (M/R VQ)) scheme is utilized in this proposed approach as the frame work of the proposed algorithm. A novel measure for calculating edge strength is devised by using the residue of an image block data from the M/R scheme. The edge strength of an image block data is then utilized as a tool to allocate the proper code vectors in the proposed WCNN. The WCNN successfully allocates more code vectors to the image block data from edge area while it allocates less code vectors to the image block data from shade or non-edge area when compared to conventional the neural network based VQ algorithm. As a result, a simple application of WCNN to image compression problem gives improved edge characteristics in reproduced images over conventional neural network based VQ algorithms."

This paper describes a hybrid model in which a high-dimensional subset of the parameters are trained to maximize generative likelihood, and another, small, subset of parameters are discriminatively trained to maximize conditional likelihood. We give a sample complexity bound showing that in order to fit the discriminative parameters well, the number of training examples required depends only on the logarithm of the number of feature occurrences and feature set size. Experimental results show that hybrid models can provide lower test error and can produce better accuracy/coverage curves than either their purely generative or purely discriminative counterparts. We also discuss several advantages of hybrid models, and advocate further work in this area."

Logically, a linear model will not be able to perform restoration satisfactorily if a blurring function is strongly nonlinear. This paper aims to develop a technique for nonlinear image restoration using a machine learning approach, where no prior knowledge and assumptions about the blurring process and the additive noise are required. Although some similar learning image restoration methods exist, no one has explored the mechanism to determine why a mapping neural network can be used in modeling the degradation process, and why it works well for some images but does not behave properly for others. In this work, we try to get a better understanding about these. A generic nonlinear image restoration model is considered in this paper. Based on our previous study, a standard radial basis function (RBF) network is employed to realize the functional mapping from the degraded image space to the original image space, which is dynamically structured to ensure good generalization in restoration. The proposed adaptive RBF network is implemented in a dynamic component-based software framework, which can run in either sequential or parallel modes. Primary simulation results indicate that our proposed method perform well in restoring spatially invariant images degraded by nonlinear distortion and noise."

The whole decision process is organised into successive stages, each using a very reduced set of features for recognising forgeries and providing information about the reliability of the recognition process. The first expert, adopting only a single global feature, is devoted to the elimination of random and simple forgeries. The second stage receives only those signatures not classified as false by the first stage (i.e. those signatures really genuine or forgeries reproduced in a skilled way), and adopts a single specific feature suitable for isolating skilled forgeries. Both of these two stages employ suitable criteria for estimating the reliability of the performed classification, so that, in case of uncertainty, the signature is forwarded to a final stage which takes the final decision, taking into account the decisions of the previous stages together with the corresponding reliability estimations. The proposed multi-stage automatic signature verification system has been tested on a database of signatures produced by 49 different writers. The experimental analysis highlights the effectiveness of the approach: the proposed system employing only two features, used in distinct moments of the decision process, performs better than other systems, employing larger feature set (including the features used in the proposed system) and performing classification in a single stage."

Unlike previous methods, weight adaptation is adopted during segmentation to remove noise and preserve significant discontinuities in an image. Moreover, a logarithmic grouping rule is proposed to facilitate grouping of oscillators representing pixels with coherent properties. We show that weight adaptation plays the roles of noise removal and feature preservation. In particular, our weight adaptation scheme is insensitive to termination time and the resulting dynamic weights in a wide range of iterations lead to the same segmentation results. A computer algorithm derived from oscillatory dynamics is applied to synthetic and real images and simulation results show that the algorithm yields favorable segmentation results in comparison with other recent algorithms. In addition, the weight adaptation scheme can be directly transformed to a novel feature-preserving smoothing procedure. We also demonstrate that our nonlinear smoothing algorithm achieves good results for various kinds of images."

It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture inducstries. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquers this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on Ricci flow and nonlinear heat diffusion methods. The approach is general and robust. We employ our algorithm to study the constrained surface registration problem which applies to both computer vision and medical imaging applications. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic and achieve relatively high performance when evaluated with some popular surface registration evaluation standards."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units.

Such sparseness in images may occur due to poor lighting conditions, incorrect thresholding or image subsampling. Furthermore, in document image analysis, sparse shapes are characteristic of texts faded due to aging and/or poor ink quality. Due to the lack of pixel level connectivity, conventional skeletonization techniques perform poorly on such (sparse) shapes. Given the pixel distribution for a shape, the proposed method involves an iterative evolution of a piecewise-linear approximation of the shape skeleton by using a minimum spanning tree-based self-organizing map (SOM). By constraining the SOM to lie on the edges of the Delaunay triangulation of the shape distribution, the adjacency relationships between regions in the shape are detected and used in the evolution of the skeleton. The SOM, on convergence, gives the final skeletal shape. The skeletonization is invariant to Euclidean transformations. The potential of the method is demonstrated on a variety of sparse shapes from different application domains."

The NEE is a supervised edge enhancer: Through training with a set of input noisy images and teaching edges, the NEE acquires the function of a desired edge enhancer. The input images are synthesized from noiseless images by addition of noise. The teaching edges are made from the noiseless images by performing the desired edge enhancer. To investigate the performance, we carried out experiments to enhance edges from noisy artificial and natural images. By comparison with conventional edge enhancers, the following was demonstrated: The NEE was robust against noise, was able to enhance continuous edges from noisy images, and was superior to the conventional edge enhancers in similarity to the desired edges. To gain insight into the nonlinear kernel of the NEE, we performed analyses on the trained NEE. The results suggested that the trained NEE acquired directional gradient operators with smoothing. Furthermore, we propose a method for edge localization for the NEE. We compared the NEE, together with the proposed edge localization method, with a leading edge detector. The NEE was proven to be useful for enhancing edges from noisy images."

Based on this approach, we present a Fuzzy ARTMAP based system for the elimination of random forgeries. Compared to the conventional systems proposed thus far, the presented system is trained with genuine signatures only. Six experiments have been performed on a data base of 200 signatures taken from five writers (40 signatures/writer). Evaluation of the system was measured using different numbers of training signatures."

These moment invariants are not invariant when an image is scaled non-uniformly in the x- and y-axes directions. This paper addresses this problem by presenting a new technique to obtain moments that are invariant to non-uniform scaling. However, this technique produces a set of features that are only invariant to translation and uniform/non-uniform scaling. To obtain invariance to rotation, moments are calculated with respect to the x-y-axis of the image. To perform this, a neural network is used to estimate the angle of rotation from the x-y-axis and the image is unrotated to the x-y-axis. Consequently, we are able to obtain features that are invariant to translation, rotation and uniform/non-uniform scaling. The mathematical background behind the development and invariance of the new moments are presented. The results of experimental studies using English alphabets and Arabic numerals scaled uniformly/non-uniformly, rotated and translated are discussed to further verify the validity of the new moments."

In document images, undefined pixel values at known locations can have several causes, such as the occurrence of a scratch or blemish on the contact glass of a scanner or the malfunction of a CCD sensor. Once identified, these known locations provide critical information that can be exploited to continue the image from the reliable parts to these unreliable regions. The authors present a family of algorithms accomplishing image continuation, using a small, simple kernel function adaptively applied on successive iterations. Some theoretical properties of this family other than convergence have been established and several examples are presented to illustrate the behavior of the algorithms.<<ETX>>"

Methods for achieving this goal are proposed, that range from deriving and introducing a bias into a learner to automatically learning the bias. In the latter case, most methods learn the bias by simultaneously training several related tasks derived from the same domain and imposing constraints on their parameters. We extend some of the ideas presented in this field and describe a new model that parametrizes the parameters of each task as a function of an affine manifold defined in parameter space and a point lying on the manifold. An analysis of variance on a class of learning tasks is performed that shows some significantly improved performances when using the model."

We consider two fundamental aspects of faxed image restoration: modeling and the restoration algorithm. First, a model of a faxed image is presented. The model is based on an autoregressive Gauss-Markov random field and includes vertical and horizontal overlap effects. In particular, we concentrate on the nonsymmetric half plane causality. Second, the restoration of faxed images degraded by salient noise and additive white noise is considered by 2D Kalman filtering which provides an efficient recursive procedure. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we present experimental results on the restoration of a faxed image."
