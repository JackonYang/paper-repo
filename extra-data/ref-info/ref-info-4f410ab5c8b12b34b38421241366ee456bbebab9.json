In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

A remaining problem, however, is the selection of state-transition structure for the model. This paper demonstrates that extraction accuracy strongly depends on the selection of structure, and presents an algorithm for automatically finding good structures by stochastic optimization. Our algorithm begins with a simple model and then performs hill-climbing in the space of possible structures by splitting states and gauging performance on a validation set. Experimental results show that this technique finds HMM models that almost always out-perform a fixed model, and have superior average performance across tasks."

This paper describes the application of HMMs to another language related task--information extraction--the problem of locating textual sub-segments that answer a particular information need. In our work, the HMM state transition probabilities and word emission probabilities are learned from labeled training data. As in many machine learning problems, however, the lack of sufficient labeled training data hinders the reliability of the model. The key contribution of this paper is the use of a statistical technique called \"shrinkage\" that significantly improves parameter estimation of the HMM emission probabilities in the face of sparse training data. In experiments on seminar announcements and Reuters acquisitions articles, shrinkage is shown to reduce error by up to 40%, and the resulting HMM outperforms a state-of-the-art rule-learning system."

In place of syntactic and semantic information, other sources of information can be used, such as term frequency, typography, formatting, and mark-up. We describe four learning approaches to this problem, each drawn from a different paradigm: a rote learner, a term-space learner based on Naive Bayes, an approach using grammatical induction, and a relational rule learner. Experiments on 14 information extraction problems defined over four diverse document collections demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Finally, we describe a multistrategy approach which combines these learners and yields performance competitive with or better than the best of them. This technique is modular and flexible, and could find application in other machine learning problems."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states.

                "text": "OF THE THESIS Information Extraction Using Hidden Markov Models by Timothy Robert Leek Master of Science in Computer Science University of California, San Diego, 1997 Professor Charles Peter Elkan, Chair This thesis shows how to design and tune a hidden Markov model to extract factual information from a corpus of machine-readable English prose. In particular, the thesis presents a HMM that classi es and parses natural language assertions about genes being located at particular positions on chromosomes. The facts extracted by this HMM can be inserted into biological databases. The HMM is trained on a small set of sentence fragments chosen from the collected scienti c abstracts in the OMIM (On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database and judged to contain the target binary relationship between gene names and gene locations. Given a novel sentence, all contiguous fragments are ranked by log-odds score, i.e. the log of the ratio of the probability of the fragment according to the target HMM to that according to a \\null\" HMM trained on all OMIM sentences. The most probable path through the HMM gives bindings for the annotations with precision as high as 80%. In contrast with traditional natural language processing methods, this stochastic approach makes no use either of part-of-speech taggers or dictionaries, instead employing non-emitting states to assemble modules roughly corresponding to noun, verb, and prepostional phrases. Algorithms for reestimating parameters for HMMs with non-emitting states are presented in detail. The ability to tolerate new words and recognize a wide variety of syntactic forms arises from the judicious use of \\gap\" states. v Chapter I Good Facts Are Hard to Find Finding facts in English prose is a task that humans are good at and computers are bad at. However, humans cannot stand to spend more than a few minutes at a time occupied with such drudgery. In this respect, nding facts is unlike a host of the other jobs computers are currently hopeless at, like telling a joke, riding a bike, and cooking a dinner. While there is no pressing need for computers to be good at those things, it is already of paramount importance that computers be pro cient at nding information with precision in the proliferating archives of electronic text available on the Internet and elsewhere. The state of the art in information retrieval technology is of limited use in this application. Standard boolean searching, vectorbased approaches and latent semantic indexing are geared more toward open-ended exploration than toward the targeted, detailed subsentence processing necessary for the fact nding or information extraction task. Since these approaches discard syntax, a large class of targets, in which the relationships between groups of words are important, must be fundamentally beyond them. The critical noun and verb groups of a fact can only be found by doing some kind of parsing. Information extraction is in most cases what people really want to do when they rst set about searching text, i.e. before they lower their sights to correspond to available tools. But this does not mean that nothing less than full-blown NLP (natural language processing) will satisfy. There are many real-world text searching 1 2 tasks that absolutely require syntactic information and yet are restricted enough to be tractable. An historian might want to locate passages in the Virginia colony records mentioning the \\event\" of a slave running away. The words slave, run, and away, all very common words, and their various synonyms used in an unconstrained search would return much dross. To nd this fact with precision we need to place constraints upon the arrangement of the words in the sentence; we need to limit the search with syntax. For instance, one might require that when two groups of words corresponding to slave and run appear in a sentence, that the slave is in fact the one doing the running. Similar examples of what we call fact searching are commonplace in most domains. A market analyst might want to scan the Wall Street Journal and pick out all mentions of corporate management changes. And a geneticist would be thrilled to be able to tease out of scienti c abstracts facts mapping genes to speci c locations on chromosomes. Historically, the eld of information extraction has employed discrete manipulations in order to process sentences into the critical noun and verb groups. An incoming sentence is tagged for part-of-speech and then handed o to a scaled-down parser or DFA (deterministic nite automaton) which uses local syntax to decide if the elements of a fact are present and to divide the sentence up into logical elements. Recent advances in statistical natural language processing have been applied to this problem but typically only in an ancillary role, e.g. in constructing dictionaries [17] and tagging words for part-of-speech [4]. The main processing engine remains combinatorial in avor. Systems like FASTUS [8] and CIRCUS [14] do surprisingly well, considering the di culty of the task, achieving precision and recall of better than 80%. But they require hand-built grammars or dictionaries of extraction patterns in order to attain this level of performance. A notable exception is the LIEP [9] system which learns to generalize extraction patterns from training examples. We have chosen to pursue a uni ed stochastic approach to the information extraction task, modeling sentence fragments containing the target fact with a hidden Markov model (HMM) which we use both to decide if a candidate sentence fragment 3 contains the fact and also to identify the important elements or slot llers in the fact. An HMM trained to recognize a small set of representative sentence fragments di ers radically from a DFA or discrete pattern matcher designed for the same task in that it outputs a probability. Unlike a DFA, an HMM will accept any sequence of words with non-zero probability. The probability it computes (after some corrections for sentence length and background frequencies of words) varies gracefully between the extremes of predicting extremely low probability for sequences that tend not to contain the fact to predicting high probability for ones that tend to contain it. There is no need, if we use an HMM to nd and process facts, to employ heuristics in order to rank and choose between competing explanations for a sentence; symbolic approaches often do so [9]. The probability the HMM computes is meaningful information we can use directly to reason about candidate facts in principled ways that submit to analysis. The HMM is a very compact and exible representation for the information extraction task which seems to be less reliant upon human engineering and prior knowledge than non-probabilistic approaches. This thesis will discuss our e orts to construct a model for a binary relationship between gene names and gene locations, as found in a variety of syntactic forms in scienti c abstracts. The model is structured hierarchically: at the top level states are collected into modules corresponding to noun or verb groups, whereas at the bottom level, in some cases, states function entirely deterministically, employing DFAs to recognize commonly occurring patterns. The HMM consists of only 64 states with an average of 3 transitions each, and explicitly mentions less than 150 words. When deploying the model to nd facts in novel sentences, no attempt is made to tag for part-of-speech. \\Gap\" states, which assign emission probability according to word frequency in the entire corpus, permit the HMM to recognize disconnected segments of a fact and tolerate new words. Unknown words, if they appear in the right local context, are accepted by the HMM essentially without penalty. So while the list of words likely to participate in forming a gene name or gene location is long and populated by words both common and rare to the corpus our approach is competent at correctly identifying even unknown words as 4 long as they appear anked by other words that serve to index the fact well. The accuracy of this HMM approach to information extraction, in the context of the gene name|location fact, is on par with symbolic approaches. This thesis is organized as follows. We begin with a description of the gene name|location information extraction task. Next, we present the modular HMM architecture constructed for this task, motivating our choice of null or background model and demonstrating the discriminatory power it adds to this approach. A brief technical discussion comes next, of the precise formulae used to reestimate parameters for an HMM with non-emitting states. Then we provide implementation and optimization details, followed by training and testing performance. We conclude with some remarks on the use of prior knowledge and ideas for future work. Chapter II Automatic Annotation Generation We consider the question of nding facts in unrestricted prose in the context of lling in slots in a database of facts about genes. The slots in the database correspond to biological entities. These are described by single words or simple phrases, three examples of which might be the name of a gene, some speci cation of its location, and some list of diseases in which it is known to be involved. An example pair of acceptable entries is SLOT ENTRY Gene Name: (The gene encoding BARK2) Gene Location: (mouse chromosome 5) which we might nd buried in a sentence like The gene encoding BARK2 mapped to mouse chromosome 5, whereas that encoding BARK1 was localized to mouse chromosome 19. This is valuable information that is available nowhere except in the published literature. Specialized databases like SwissProt and GenBank do not contain these kinds of associations. So there is interest in developing automated systems for lling in these slots. In order to populate these slots, we must locate and correctly analyze binary (or perhaps even ternary and higher) relations between likely ele"

For example, in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. A standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations between them. Recently, Probabilistic Relational Models, a relational version of Bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection of related entities. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds on (conditional) Markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach. First, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation of many important relational dependencies in directed models. Second, undirected models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification accuracy. We show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of multiple related entities. We provide experimental results on a webpage classification task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies."

Traditionally, a group of words is labeled as an entity based only on local information. But information from throughout a document can be useful; for example, if the same word is used multiple times, it is likely to have the same label each time. We present a CRF that explicitly represents dependencies between the labels of pairs of similar words in a document. On a standard information extraction data set, we show that learning these dependencies leads to a 13.7% reduction in error on the field that had caused the most repetition errors."

However, in many cases, considering influences between different potential extractions could improve overall accuracy. Statistical methods based on undirected graphical models, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), have been shown to be an effective approach to learning accurate IE systems. We present a new IE method that employs Relational Markov Networks (a generalization of CRFs), which can represent arbitrary dependencies between extractions. This allows for \"collective information extraction\" that exploits the mutual influence between possible extractions. Experiments on learning to extract protein names from biomedical text demonstrate the advantages of this approach."

The most common statistic is n-grams measuring word cooccurrences in texts. The method suffers from data shortage problem, however. In this paper, we suggest Bayesian networks be used in approximating the statistics of insufficient occurrences and of those that do not occur in the sample texts with graceful degradation. Collocation map is a sigmoid belief network that can be constructed from bigrams. We compared the conditional probabilities and mutual information computed from bigrams and Collocation map. The results show that the variance of the values from Collocation map is smaller than that from frequency measure for the infrequent pairs by 48%. The predictive power of Collocation map for arbitrary associations not observed from sample texts is also demonstrated."

To date, however, no satisfactory probabilistic analogue of attribute-value grammars has been proposed: previous attempts have failed to define an adequate parameter-estimation algorithm.In the present paper, I define stochastic attribute-value grammars and give an algorithm for computing the maximum-likelihood estimate of their parameters. The estimation algorithm is adapted from Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). To estimate model parameters, it is necessary to compute the expectations of certain functions under random fields. In the application discussed by Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (representing English orthographic constraints), Gibbs sampling can be used to estimate the needed expectations. The fact that attribute-value grammars generate constrained languages makes Gibbs sampling inapplicable, but I show that sampling can be done using the more general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

We present a new IE method that employs Relational Markov Networks, which can represent arbitrary dependencies between extractions.

                "text": "This thesis describes a novel statistical named-entity (i.e. \u201cproper name\u201d) recognition system known as \u201cMENE\u201d (Maximum Entropy Named Entity). Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201cnone of the above\u201d. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, \u201cartifact\u201d. Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
