Examples of the content we use include color, texture, and shape of image objects and regions. Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

The model permits separate treatment of image components which correspond approximately to periodicity, directionality, and randomness. The authors compare its performance in an image search application to two other methods-one based on shift-invariant principle components and one based on a multiscale simultaneous autoregressive model. When textured images are ordered by distances between their Wold components, the results appear to be much closer to the human perception of similarity. The authors discuss how decoupling the three components can increase flexibility for measuring image similarity and can save computation, permitting the \"quickest\" matches when the features are the most perceptually \"salient\".<<ETX>>"

The algorithm is specifically intended as a plausible solution for the problem of indexing into very large model bases that general purpose vision systems and robots will have to deal with in the future. Other properties that make the indexing algorithm attractive are that it can take advantage of most geometric and non-geometric properties of features without modification, and that it addresses the incremental model acquisition problem for 3D objects."

                "text": "In order to transmit a video signal over a limited bandwidth channel many techniques have been developed which can reduce the quantity of data required to represent moving image sequences. Almost all current coders use techniques based on reducing the statistical redundancy of the signal and psychophysically less significant details. Such coders are relatively successful for coding signals at bandwidths of 1 Megabit/second and higher but below this level purely signal based techniques become much less robust. This thesis will attempt to use an analysis of the structure of the image, the components from which it is composed, in order to gain greater image compression. The input material is examined and divided into elements representing the background, the actors and any other significant independent objects. The background image is stored as a model at the receiver and animated according to estimates of the motion in the original scene. Actors and other foreground objects are segmented out of the scene, compressed and transmitted using conventional signal based methods. This technique typically leads to reductions in bandwidth of greater than 70%. In addition, enabling the computer to distinguish the components of the picture allows for forms of post-shoot modifications of the picture not possible with conventionally represented signals.

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"
