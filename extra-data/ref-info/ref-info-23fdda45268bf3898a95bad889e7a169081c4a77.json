Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"

The corresponding subimage is then presented to a human operator or a machine reader (optical character reader) that can read the zip code and, if necessary, other address information and direct the mail piece to the appropriate sorting bin. Analysis of physical characteristics of mail pieces indicates that in order to automate the address finding task, several different image analysis operations are necessary. Some examples are locating a rectangular white address label on a multicolor background, progressively grouping characters into text lines and text lines into text blocks, eliminating candidate regions by specialized detectors (for example, detecting regions such as postage stamps), and identifying handwritten regions. Described here are several operations, their utility as predicted by statistics of mail piece characteristics, and the results of applying the operations to a task set of mail piece images. A problem-solving architecture based on the blackboard model of problem solving for appropriately invoking the tools and combining their results is described."
