There is no need to make any assumption about the shape of blocks, hence the segmentation technique can handle not only skewed images without skew-correction but also documents where column are not rectangular. In this technique, on the bottom-up strategy, the connected components are extracted from the reduced image, and classified according to their local information. The connected components are merged into lines, and lines are merged into areas. Extracted text areas are classified as body, caption, header, and footer. A tree graph of the layout of body texts is made, and we get the order of texts by preorder traversal on the graph. The authors introduce the influence range of each node, a procedure for the title part, and extraction of the white horizontal separator. Making it possible to get good results on various documents.

The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"

Some documents have complicated column structures, in which some figure areas have no surrounding rectangles and others cut across text areas. In the approach presented, in order to segment documents into text and figure areas, the text areas are analyzed first, and the figure areas are then detected by analyzing information on the text areas. The overall process is as follows. First, character strings are merged into text groups by analyzing regularity in the text areas. Next, border lines of columns are detected by linking the edges of the text groups. After that, the whole page is segmented into small blocks according to the border lines. The blocks are then unified by using the column information, and some unified blocks are detected. Finally, a projection profile method is applied to the unified blocks in order to detect text areas and figure areas. This method was applied to 61 pages of Japanese technical papers and magazines, and 93.3% of the text areas and 93.2% of the figure areas were detected correctly.<<ETX>>"

To identify concrete layout structures, the generic descriptions are matched against input document images, and specific items on a page are extracted. Although this approach is powerful, it is rather complex and a simplification is possible. A language SFDL, a simplified version of FDL, can be used for rather regular document forms to describe characteristic patterns of the document form in terms of templates. Templates are rectangular regions among which spatial constraints are defined without recursions. By matching such templates, input document images can be classified, and bibliographic items such as a title and author\u2019s name can be extracted. Experiments have shown promising results and it can be applied to an automatic document filing system."

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"

Two basic ideas are introduced in the method. One idea is that a new parameter is used for skew detection to discern the orientation of text lines in document images. This parameter is based on the document image complexity and is obtained from the number of transitions from white to black pixels or vice versa. The other idea is that skew is detected in local regions in which only text lines are expected. Such local regions are extracted from a document image automatically and the obtained skew angle is defined as the overall document skew. Document skew has been measured in experiments with an error of 0.12 degrees on the average for all test documents.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that documents have an obvious hierarchical structure in their geometry which is represented by a tree. A small number of rules are introduced to transform the geometric structure into the logical structure which represents the semantics. The virtual field separator technique is employed to utilize the information carried by special constituents of documents such as field separators and frames, keeping the number of transformation rules small. Experimental results on a variety of document formats have shown that the proposed method is applicable to most of the documents commonly encountered in daily use, although there is still room for further refinement of the transformation rules.<<ETX>>"

There is no need to make any assumption about the shape of blocks, hence the technique can handle not only skewed pages but it can also be extended to handle documents where columns are not rectangles. In this technique, based on the bottom-up strategy, the connected components are extracted on the reduced image and are classified with their local information. Since the skew angle is also estimated with the local information of blocks, the computational time is very short. Merging text blocks into string lines and into columns is performed with the skew information.<<ETX>>"

The principal binary image operations are morphological and multiresolution. The generalized opening is introduced for extraction of both shape and texture from an image. Threshold reduction operations are introduced for performing efficient and controllable shape and texture transformations between resolution levels. Some problems, such as halftone or dark area segmentation, can be in large part solved by a sequence of threshold reductions. Aspects of the approach are illustrated by the problem of identifying italic and bold words in text, using word-level extraction at lowered resolution. The computational costs of the basic operations are given, so that algorithm efficienc y can be estimated, and the importance of operating at the lowest feasable resolution is demonstrated. For example, word segmentation and halftone extraction proceed in excess of 1.5x10 image pixels/second on a Sun Sparcstation2 ."

Perspective distortion is modeled by studying the underlying perspective geometry of the optical system of photocopiers and scanners. An illumination model is described to account for the nonlinear intensity change occuring across a page in a perspective-distorted document. The optical distortion process is modeled morphologically. First, a distance transform on the foreground is performed, followed by a random inversion of binary pixels where the probability of flip is a function of the distance of the pixel to the boundary of the foreground. Correlating the flipped pixels is modeled by a morphological closing operation.<<ETX>>"

In the OISs, document classification is one of the major functional capabilities. Classifying a document can be facilitated through the layout analysis of the document. A new approach to the layout analysis, called nested segmentation, is introduced. The layout relationships of components of a document are defined in terms of the adjacency of blocks. Given the adjacency of blocks, an adjacent block graph is introduced where the problem of the nested segmentation is transformed to a classic minimal cut problem for the graph. Also, an ordered labeled tree structure (L-S-Tree) is introduced to represent the segmented document for document classification.<<ETX>>"

Abstract : This paper describes a new approach to identify the speciic structure of a document from a generic model by a blackboard based system called Graphein. The system deals with diierent hypotheses of structuration and its methodology permits to take into account the structural context of documents. The model is described with an international standard 1 formalism (oda) which characterizes the diierent constituent objects and their subordinates. The system adopts diierent reading strategies according to the hypotheses extracted from the model. A top-down method (guided by the model) is applied when an hypothesis is sure enoughh, a mixed method extracts clues from the image before applying one hypothesis, or a full bottom-up method (fusion process) is activated when the model is not directly usable. The choice of the best strategy to apply depends on the analysis of the current hypotheses."
