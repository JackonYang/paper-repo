The channels are represented by a bank of even-symmetric Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. Feature images are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy around each pixel. Region-based segmentations are obtained by using a square-error clustering algorithm. Edge-based segmentations are obtained by applying an edge detector to each feature image and combining their magnitude responses. An integrated segmentation technique that combines the strengths of the previous two techniques while eliminating their weaknesses is proposed. The integrated approach is truly unsupervised, since it eliminates the need for knowing the exact number of texture categories in the image.<<ETX>>"

Local orientation and spatial frequencies are used as the key parameters for classifying texture. The information is obtained by creating a local multifrequency multiorientation channel decomposition of the image, with the width of each frequency band constant on a logarithmic scale. This decomposition is implemented by applying a set of Gabor-like functions that were modified to have a decreased frequency selectivity when the filter's center frequency increases. The set of filter outputs is then used to create robust texture descriptors. The segmentation algorithm uses the similarity of the descriptors to determine the existence of texture regions and to outline their border rather than concentrating on segregating the textures. The method has been applied to image containing natural textures, resulting in a good segmentation of the texture regions.<<ETX>>"

An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72% were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65% with augmented correlation statistics, and 94% with texture energy statistics."

It is based on a widely adopted human visual model which hypothesizes that the human visual system (HVS) processes input pictorial signals through a set of parallel and quasi-independent mechanisms or channels. This model is referred to as the multichannel spatial filtering model (MSFM). The core of the MSFM presently applied is the recently formulated cortical channel model (CCM), which attempts to model the process of texture feature extraction in each individual channel in the MSFM. With these models, successful algorithms for both texture classification and segmentation (texture edge detection) have been developed. The algorithm for texture feature extraction and classification is compared with the conventional benchmark, i.e., the gray-level cooccurrence matrix approach, and proves to be superior in many aspects. The algorithm for texture edge detection is tested under a variety of textured images, and good segmentation results are obtained.<<ETX>>"

The functional uncertainty of the channel filters is shown to define a tradeoff between spectral selectivity and accuracy in boundary localization that is optimized by the 2-D Gabor functions. The idealized texture model is then relaxed to analyze the effects of textural perturbations interpreted as localized amplitude and phase variations on the segmentation.

Significant differences in the density, orientation, size, or contrast of line segments or other small features in an image have been shown to cause immediate perception of texture boundaries. However, the psychological theories, which are based on the perception of synthetic images composed of lines and symbols, neglect two important issues. First, how can textons be computed from grey-level images of natural scenes? And second, how, exactly, can texture boundaries be found? Our analysis of these two issues has led to an algorithm that is fully implemented and which successfully detects boundaries in natural images5. We propose that blobs computed by a centre-surround operator are useful as texture elements, and that a simple non-parametric statistic can be used to compare local distributions of blob attributes to locate texture boundaries. Although designed for natural images, our computation agrees with some psycho-physical findings, in particular, those of Adelson and Bergen (described in the preceding article6), which cast doubt on the hypothesis that line segment crossings or termination points are textons."

Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures. >"

Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image.

It is noted that the Wigner distribution gives superior joint resolution.

In psychophysiology, multichannel models have been particularly successful in explaining some low-level processing in the visual cortex. The expansion of a function into several frequency channels provides a representation which is intermediate between a spatial and a Fourier representation. The author describes the mathematical properties of such decompositions and introduces the wavelet transform. He reviews the classical multiresolution pyramidal transforms developed in computer vision and shows how they relate to the decomposition of an image into a wavelet orthonormal basis. He discusses the properties of the zero crossings of multifrequency channels. Zero-crossing representations are particularly well adapted for pattern recognition in computer vision. >"

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other. The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations.

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals.

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

These features, called \u201ctextons\u201d, are elongated blobs (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, or line segments) with specific properties, including color, angular orientation, width, length, binocular and movement disparity, and flicker rate. The ends-of-lines (terminators) and crossings of line segments are also textons. Only differences in the textons or in their density (or number) can be preattentively detected while the positional relationship between neighboring textons passes unnoticed. This kind of positional information is the essence of form perception, and can be extracted only by a time-consuming and spatially restricted process that we call \u201cfocal attention\u201d. The aperture of focal attention can be very narrow, even restricted to a minute portion of the fovea, and shifting its locus requires about 50 ms. Thus preattentive vision serves as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d by pointing out those loci of texton differences that should be attended to. According to this theory, at any given instant the visual information intake is relatively modest."
