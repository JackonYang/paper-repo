A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

A framework is presented for examining the effect of particular variables on the performance of the system, and preliminary results are presented showing the effect of cohesion measures based on the simplest domain-independent analyses, with the aim allowing future comparison with more knowledge-intensive analyses based on natural language processing. These baseline results suggest that very simple string-based cohesion measures are not sufficient to support the extraction of tuples as we require.

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

Decision making is more transparent in formal model based approaches (e.g. grammar based) but these approaches are less flexible than informal ones. We propose an intermediate level of formalization, defining strategies as a sequence of basic graph transformations that correspond to recognition operations (e.g. classification, segmentation). Transformations are parameterized by logical types and decision functions, which together define structure models and executable strategies for interpreting input graphs. We provide an overview of our first attempt at this intermediate level of formalization, the Recognition Strategy Language (RSL). As a proof of concept, we reimplement two informally specified table recognition strategies from the literature in RSL. The RSL implementations capture descriptions of the formerly implicit table structure models, and automatically capture all decision making."

The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables, and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies the decisions that are made by a table recognizer, and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

Ontologies and the Semantic Web are offered as a potential solution, but creating ontologies for real-world knowledge is nontrivial. If we could automate the process, we could significantly improve our chances of making the Semantic Web a reality. While understanding natural language is difficult, tables and other structured information make it easier to interpret new items and relations. In this paper we introduce an approach to generating ontologies based on table analysis. We thus call our approach TANGO (Table ANalysis for Generating Ontologies). Based on conceptual modeling extraction techniques, TANGO attempts to (i) understand a table's structure and conceptual content; (ii) discover the constraints that hold between concepts extracted from the table; (iii) match the recognized concepts with ones from a more general specification of related concepts; and (iv) merge the resulting structure with other similar knowledge representations. TANGO is thus a formalized method of processing the format and content of tables that can serve to incrementally build a relevant reusable conceptual ontology."

The motivation for interactive pattern recognition is simply that it may be more effective to make parsimonious use of human visual talent throughout the process. \nWe introduce the concept of Computer Assisted Visual InterActive Recognition (CAVIAR). In object classification with CAVIAR, a domain-specific geometrical model, e.g., a set of contours or critical feature points, plays the central role in facilitating the communication (interaction) between human and computer. The key to effective interaction is the display of the automatically-fitted adjustable model that lets the human retain the initiative throughout the classification process. The alternating human and computer steps in the CAVIAR process are modelled as a finite state machine. The computer tries its best to estimate an initial model for the unknown sample and calculate its similarity to the training samples that belong to each class. Representative training pictures are displayed in the order of computer-calculated similarities. The model is also displayed to the user, who can correct it if necessary. Any correction leads to an update of the CAVIAR state, re-estimation of the remaining unadjusted model parameters, and re-ordering of the candidates. A CAVIAR classification is concluded with a final confirmation by the user. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of the proposed methodology by implementing two systems: CAVIAR-flower and CAVIAR-face. Evaluation of these two systems on 51 subjects reveals that: (1)\u00a0CAVIAR can significantly reduce the recognition time compared to the unaided human, and significantly increase the accuracy compared to the unaided machine; (2)\u00a0human-computer communication through a geometrical model is effective; (3)\u00a0the CAVIAR system can be initialized with a single training sample per class, but still achieve high accuracy; (4)\u00a0the CAVIAR system shows self-learning ability and improves with use. \nCAVIAR is being ported to a mobile hand-held computer as a client connecting to an Internet server. Possible applications to other domains include face, sign, and skin disease recognition."

We are developing these capabilities within the context of two applications: Coalition Search and Rescue (CoSAR-TS) and Semantic Firewall (SFW). We describe how this work has uncovered requirements for increasing the expressivity of policy beyond what can be done with description logic (e.g., role-value-maps), and how we are extending our representation and reasoning mechanisms in a carefully controlled manner to that end. Since KAoS employs OWL for policy representation, it fits naturally with the use of OWL-S workflow descriptions generated by the AIAI I-X planning system in the CoSAR-TS application. The advanced reasoning mechanisms of KAoS are based on the JTP inference engine and enable the analysis of classes and instances of processes from a policy perspective. As the result of analysis, KAoS concludes whether a particular workflow step is allowed by policy and whether the performance of this step would incur additional policy-generated obligations. Issues in the representation of processes within OWL-S are described. Besides what is done during workflow composition, aspects of policy compliance can be checked at runtime when a workflow is enacted. We illustrate these capabilities through two application examples. Finally, we outline plans for future work."
