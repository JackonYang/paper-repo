Specifically, entity linking is the task to link the entity mention in text with the corresponding real world entity in the existing knowledge base. However, this task is challenging due to name ambiguity, textual inconsistency, and lack of world knowledge in the knowledge base. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, but they are largely based on the co-occurrence statistics of terms between the text around the entity mention and the document associated with the entity. In this paper, we propose LINDEN, a novel framework to link named entities in text with a knowledge base unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the Wikipedia and the taxonomy of the knowledge base. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed LINDEN over two public data sets and empirical results show that LINDEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy."

In this paper, we employ Freebase as the knowledge base, which contains significantly more entities than Wikipedia and others. While huge in size, Freebase lacks context for most entities, such as the descriptive text and hyperlinks in Wikipedia, which are useful for disambiguation. Instead, we leverage two features of Freebase, namely the naturally disambiguated mention phrases (aka aliases) and the rich taxonomy, to perform disambiguation in an iterative manner. Specifically, we explore both generative and discriminative models for each iteration. Experiments on 2, 430, 707 English sentences and 33, 743 Freebase entities show the effectiveness of the two features, where 90% accuracy can be reached without any labeled data. We also show that discriminative models with proposed split training strategy is robust against over fitting problem, and constantly outperforms the generative ones."

Entity Linking, also referred to as record linkage or entity resolution, involves aligning a textual mention of a named-entity to an appropriate entry in a knowledge base, which may or may not contain the entity. This has manifold applications ranging from linking patient health records to maintaining personal credit files, prevention of identity crimes, and supporting law enforcement. We discuss the key challenges present in this task and we present a high-performing system that links entities using max-margin ranking.

The main goal of KBP is to promote research in discovering facts about entities and augmenting a knowledge base (KB) with these facts. This is done through two tasks, Entity Linking -- linking names in context to entities in the KB -- and Slot Filling -- adding information about an entity to the KB. A large source collection of newswire and web documents is provided from which systems are to discover information. Attributes (\"slots\") derived from Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the reference KB. In this paper we provide an overview of the techniques which can serve as a basis for a good KBP system, lay out the remaining challenges by comparison with traditional Information Extraction (IE) and Question Answering (QA) tasks, and provide some suggestions to address these challenges."

Attributes (a.k.a. \u201cslots\u201d) derived from Wikipedia infoboxes are used to create the reference knowledge base (KB). KBP2010 includes the following four tasks: (1) Regular Entity Linking, where names must be aligned to entities in the KB; (2) Optional Entity linking, without using Wikipedia texts; (3) Regular Slot Filling, which requires a system to automatically discover the attributes of specified entities from the source document collection and use them to expand the KB; (4) Surprise Slot Filling, which requires a system to return answers regarding new slot types within a short time period. KBP2010 has attracted many participants (over 45 teams registered for KBP 2010 (not including the RTEKBP Validation Pilot task), among which 23 teams submitted results).

It explains how machine learning can be used to identify significant terms within unstructured text, and enrich it with links to the appropriate Wikipedia articles. The resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well, with recall and precision of almost 75%. This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or \"real world\" documents.\n This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text. Any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing, clustering, retrieval, and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics."

The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call \"global\" approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat."

The field of information extraction has its genesis in the natural language processing community where the primary impetus came from competitions centered around the recognition of named entities like people names and organization from news articles. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around. Now, there is interest in converting our personal desktops to structured databases, the knowledge in scientific publications to structured records, and harnessing the Internet for structured fact finding queries. Consequently, there are many different communities of researchers bringing in techniques from machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and computational linguistics for various aspects of the information extraction problem. \n \nThis review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models. We survey techniques for optimizing the various steps in an information extraction pipeline, adapting to dynamic data, integrating with existing entities and handling uncertainty in the extraction process."

However, information in text form, such as MEDLINE records, remains a greatly underutilized source of biological information. We have begun a research effort aimed at automatically mapping information from text sources into structured representations, such as knowledge bases. Our approach to this task is to use machine-learning methods to induce routines for extracting facts from text. We describe two learning methods that we have applied to this task--a statistical text classification method, and a relational learning method--and our initial experiments in learning such information-extraction routines. We also present an approach to decreasing the cost of learning information-extraction routines by learning from \"weakly\" labeled training data."

The problem for wider deployment of the technology is adaptability: the ability to customize IE rapidly to new domains. In this paper we discuss some methods that have been tried to ease this problem, and to create something more rapid than the bench-mark one-month figure, which was roughly what ARPA teams in IE needed to adapt an existing system by hand to a new domain of corpora and templates. An important distinction in discussing the issue is the degree to which a user can be assumed to know what is wanted, to have preexisting templates ready to hand, as opposed to a user who has a vague idea of what is needed from a corpus. We shall discuss attempts to derive templates directly from corpora; to derive knowledge structures and lexicons directly from corpora, including discussion of the recent LE project ECRAN which attempted to tune existing lexicons to new corpora. An important issue is how far established methods in Information Retrieval of tuning to a user\u2019s needs with feedback at an interface can be transferred to IE."

To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-byfeature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods."

We report observations about languages, named entity types, domains and textual genres studied in the literature. From the start, NERC systems have been developed using hand-made rules, but now machine learning techniques are widely used. These techniques are surveyed along with other critical aspects of NERC such as features and evaluation methods. Features are word-level, dictionary-level and corpus-level representations of words in a document. Evaluation techniques, ranging from intuitive exact match to very complex matching techniques with adjustable cost of errors, are an indisputable key to progress."

Variations and errors in names make exact string matching problematic, and approximate matching techniques have to be applied. When compared to general text, however, personal names have different characteristics that need to be considered. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of personal names and present potential sources of variations and errors. We then overview a comprehensive number of commonly used, as well as some recently developed name matching techniques. Experimental comparisons using four large name data sets indicate that there is no clear best matching technique"

The constraints imposed by formal sentence structure alone did not reduce the amplitude of the N400 component elicited by open-class words, whereas semantic constraints did. Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally. A second ERP component, distinct from the N400, was elicited primarily by congruent closed-class words."
