                "text": "NETtalk is a massively-parallel network that learns to convert English text to phonemes. In NETtalk, the memory representations are shared among many processing units, and these representations are learned by practice. In humans, distributed practice is more effective for longterm retention than massed practice, and we wondered whether learning in NETtalk had similar properties. NETtalk was tested on cued paired-associate recall using nonwords as stimuli. Retention of these target items was measured as a function of spacing, or the number of interspersed items between successive repetitions of the target. A significant advantage for spaced or distributed items was found for spacings of up to forty intervening items when tested at a retention interval of 64 items. Conversely, a significant advantage for massed items was found if testing immediately followed study. These results'are strikingly similar to the results of many experiments using human subjects and suggest an explanation based on distributed representations in massively-parallel network architectures."

Children are typically said to pass through a three-phase acquisition process in which they first learn past tense by rote, then learn the past tense rule and over regularize, and then finally learn the exceptions to the rule. We show that the acquisition data can be accounted for in more detail by dispensing with the assumption that the child learns rules and substituting in its place a simple homogeneous learning procedure. We show how rule-like behavior can emerge from the interactions among a network of units encoding the root form to past tense mapping. A large computer simulation of the learning process demonstrates the operating principles of our alternative account, shows how details of the acquisition process not captured by the rule account emerge, and makes predictions about other details of the acquisition process not yet observed.

Alshawi is looking for the algorithms that produce the optimal interpretation of a text. How can he justify these algorithms when he discards psychology and neurophysiology? What constitutes the optimal interpretation of a text? These questions are left unanswered. What remains is the implementation of a solution to some specific problems considered in a vacuum. The dissertation presents the advantages and limitations of a particular solution; several other solutions to these problems have been suggested. Each author compares his model to the others but the relative vacuity of it all persists. Suspiciously, all models share the same basic flaws (e.g., simplistic model of memory, and absence of mechanisms for the subsequent correction of an erroneous interpretation). By dissociating NLP, with its cartesian quest for optimal interpretation algorithms, from man, his language, his formidable ability to understand and to misunderstand and to not understand, computational linguists seem to have created the ultimate field of study, one where partial solutions are taken to intrinsically hold the promise of an eventual complete and correct solution to the problem of linguistic understanding. I reject the notion of the \"optimal interpretation\" of a text and, after reading Alshawi's book, I am left with the bitter taste of an interesting yet very artificial Lisp program."

Very rarely, a book is published which not only advances our knowledge of a particular topic, but fundamentally recasts our methods of investigating and thinking about large tracts of the map of learning. Linguists remember 1957 as the publication year of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic structures-a book whose ostensible subjects were the structure of English grammatical rules and the goals of grammatical description, but which can be seen with hindsight as the first shot in an intellectual revolution which ended by radically changing the texture of day-to-day research activity and discourse throughout almost all of linguistics, and in substantial parts of other cognition-related disciplines. In decades to come, perhaps 1986 will be remembered by academics as the year of publication of the pair of volumes reviewed here: they constitute the first large-scale public statement of an intellectual paradigm fully as revolutionary as the generative paradigm ever was (there have been scattered journal articles in the preceding four or five years). I would go further and suggest that, if the promises of this book can be redeemed, the contrast in linguistics and neighboring disciplines between the 1990's and the 1970's will be significantly greater than the contrast between the 1970's and the 1950's. (I need hardly add, of course, that it is one thing to fire an opening salvo, but another to achieve ultimate predominance.) The new paradigm is called Parallel Distributed Processing by the sixteen writers who contributed to this book, many of whom work either at the University of California, San Diego, or at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Some other researchers (e.g. Feldman 1985) use the term 'connectionism' for the same concept. These two volumes comprise 26 chapters which, among them, (i) explain the over-all nature and aims of PDP/connectionist models, (ii) define a family of specific variants of the general paradigm, and (iii) exemplify it by describing experiments in which PDP models were used to simulate human performance in various cognitive domains. The experiments, inevitably, treat their respective domains in a simplified, schematic way by comparison with the endless complexity found in any real-life cognitive area; but simplification in this case does not mean trivialization. There are also auxiliary chapters on relevant related topics; thus Chap. 9, by M. I. JORDAN, is a tutorial on linear algebra, a branch of mathematics having special significance for the PDP paradigm.

The MIT text-to-speech system, on which Jonathan Allen has collaborated with Sheri Hunnicutt, Dennis Klatt and other colleagues, has set new standards for intelligibility, linguistic sophistication and methods of evaluation.

These volumes by a pioneering neurocomputing group suggest that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind. The authors' theory assumes the mind is composed of a great number of elementary units connected in a neural network. Mental processes are interactions between these units which excite and inhibit each other in parallel rather than sequential operations. In this context, knowledge can no longer be thought of as stored in localized structures; instead, it consists of the connections between pairs of units that are distributed throughout the network. Volume 1 lays the foundations of this exciting theory of parallel distributed processing, while Volume 2 applies it to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience, with chapters describing models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.

When one disease is far more likely than another, the model predicts that subjects will substantially overestimate the diagnosticity of the more valid symptom for the rare disease. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 provide clear support for this prediction in contradistinction to predictions from probability matching, exemplar retrieval, or simple prototype learning models. Experiment 3 contrasted the adaptive network model with one predicting pattern-probability matching when patients always had four symptoms (chosen from four opponent pairs) rather than the presence or absence of each of four symptoms, as in Experiment 1. The results again support the Rescorla-Wagner LMS learning rule as embedded within an adaptive network model."

It is impossible to determine the stress of a word by looking through a five\u2010 or six\u2010character window, as many speech synthesizers do. Well\u2010known examples such as degrade/degradation and telegraph/telegraphy demonstrate that stress dependencies can span over two and three syllables.

In this article we develop a similar adaptive element, but one which is more closely in accord with the facts of animal learning theory than elements commonly studied in adaptive network research. We suggest that an essential feature of classical conditioning that has been largely overlooked by adaptive network theorists is its predictive nature. The adaptive element we present learns to increase its response rate in anticipation of increased stimulation, producing a conditioned response before the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The element also is in strong agreement with the behavioral data regarding the effects of stimulus context, since it is a temporally refined extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model. We show by computer simulation that the element becomes sensitive to the most reliable, nonredundant, and earliest predictors of reinforcement . We also point out that the model solves many of the stability and saturation problems encountered in network simulations. Finally, we discuss our model in light of recent advances in the physiology and biochemistry of synaptic mechanisms."

Indeed, the current circuit model robustly exhibits many of the basic phenomena of classical conditionin~ The model, however, requires a further assumption (regarding the form of the acquisition function) to predict asymptotic blocking and contingency leamin~ In addition, if extinction is mediated by the nonassociative mechanism of habituationwrather than the associative process postulated by Rescorla and Wagner (1972)---then we argue that additional mechanisms must be specified to resolve a conflict between acquisition and maintenance of learned associations.

Trlalditional proposals have taken one of two extreme views: The one-concept, one-neuron, punctate view and the full distributed, holographic alternative. Major advances in the behavioral, biological and computational sciences have greatly increased our understanding of the question and its potential answers. There is now good reason to reject both extreme views, but a compact encoding that derives from the punctate model appears to fit well with all the facts. Much of the work espousing holographic models is reinterpreted as studying system properties of neural networks and, as such, considered to be of great importance. Some suggestions for directions of further research are discussed."

In the approach presented here, however, each network component, or adaptive element, is a self-interested agent that prefers some inputs over others and \"works\" toward obtaining the most highly preferred inputs. Here we describe an adaptive element that is robust enough to learn to cooperate with other elements like itself in order to further its self-interests. It is argued that some of the longstanding problems concerning adaptation and learning by networks might be solvable by this form of cooperativity, and computer simulation experiments are described that show how networks of self-interested components that are sufficiently robust can solve rather difficult learning problems. We then place the approach in its proper historical and theoretical perspective through comparison with a number of related algorithms. A secondary aim of this article is to suggest that beyond what is explicitly illustrated here, there is a wealth of ideas from game theory and allied disciplines such as mathematical economics that can be of use in thinking about cooperative computation in both nervous systems and man-made systems."

This general framework has been instantiated in the ACT system in which facts are encoded in a propositional network and procedures are encoded as productions. Knowledge compilation is the process by which the skill transits from the declarative stage to the procedural stage. It consists of the subprocesses of composition, which collapses sequences of productions into single productions, and proceduralization, which embeds factual knowledge into productions. Once proceduralized, further learning processes operate on the skill to make the productions more selective in their range of applications. These processes include generalization, discrimination, and strengthening of productions. Comparisons are made to similar concepts from past learning theories. How these learning mechanisms apply to produce the power law speedup in processing time with practice is discussed."

Suppose that some data source provides samples consisting of n-dimensional feature-vectors, but that this data all happens to lie on an m-dimensional surface embedded in the n-dimensional feature space. Then occurrences of data can be more concisely described by specifying an m-dimensional location on the embedded surface than by reciting all n components of the feature vector. The recoding of data in such a way is a form of abstraction. This paper describes a method for performing this type of abstraction in connectionist networks of simple computing elements. We present a scheme for representing the values of continuous (scalar) variables in subsets of units. The backpropagation weight updating method for training connectionist networks is extended by the use of auxiliary pressure in order to coax hidden units into the prescribed representation for scalar-valued variables."

                "text": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and interconnexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Parallelism, rather than raw speed of the computing elements, seems to be the way that the brain gets such jobs done. But even if die need for massive parallelism is admitted, there is still the question of what kind of parallel architecture best fits the needs of various AI tasks. \n \nIn this paper we will attempt to isolate a number of basic computational tasks that an intelligent system must perform. We will describe several families of massively parallel computing architectures, and we will see which of diese computational tasks can be handled by each of these families. In particular, we will describe a new architecture, which we call the Boltzmann machine, whose abilities appear to include a number of tasks that are inefficient or impossible on the other architectures."

I suggest that we employ a system which is the temporal analogue of optical holography1\u20133. The analogy between holography and visual memory has already attracted attention in the literature, but this is not quite the thought that I shall pursue here ; rather I shall consider the time dimension, because any perceptual event must certainly be associated with cerebral happenings which are extended not only in space but in time. If a system of this kind were indeed used by the brain, not only would some familiar phenomena of perception be naturally explained, but the cells or cell clusters responsible for laying down sensory information should have a certain property which might be accessible to experimental test."

It is formally related to statistical mechanics with the aim to describe memory storage during development and in the adult. Networks with symmetric interactions have been shown to function as content-addressable memories, but the present approach differs from previous instructive models. Four biologically relevant aspects are treated--initial state before learning, synaptic sign changes, hierarchical categorization of stored patterns, and synaptic learning rule. Several of the hypotheses are tested numerically. Starting from the limit case of random connections (spin glass), selection is viewed as pruning of a complex tree of states generated with maximal parsimony of genetic information."

The major intent of the present paper is to explicate a more precise version of the form of theory involved, and to indicate how it may be usefully applied to a variety of phenomena in\u00b7 volving asso('iative learning. The impetus for a new theoretical model is not generally a new datum which dearly disconfirms existing theory. It is more likely to be the accumulation of a salient pattern of data, separate portions of which may be ade(luately handled by separate existing theories, but which apo pears to invite a more integrated theoretical account. Such, at least, is the better description of the background of the present work. In the sections which follow we will first describe certain data from our laboratories which exemplify the kind of observations which have encouraged the present theorizing. The theory will then be presented in sufficient detail to show how it may be applied to experimental situations involving a variety of Pavlovian conditioning arrangements. Finally, we will briefly discuss the theory in relationship to more conventional approaches."

By examining the properties of learning networks that are independent of their architectures, this paper proposes that there is at least one type of cell which can be used in any reasonable architecture to give it nearly optimal performance. Cells of this type implement an algorithm called second order least mean square (2nd order LMS, for short)."

                "text": "Abstract : At this early stage in the development of cognitive science, methodological issues are both open and central. There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

Pairs consisting of a word and a number as well as pairs consisting of 2 words showed a superiority at 8 sec. and longer retention intervals when presentations were spaced. Increasing the spacing interval beyond 8 sec. did not increase recall, when a 2-sec. rate of presentation was used. A 2-factor explanation of the findings was suggested, in which cue learning was the major factor influencing recall at longer retention intervals, while a 2nd factor was confounded with cue learning at short retention intervals. An initial investigation varying the time interval between two presentations of an individual pair of associates has been reported (Peterson, Hillner, & Saltzman, 1962). Using a technique described earlier (Peterson, Saltzman, Hillner, & Land, 1962), presentations of other pairs of words and numbers filled both a spacing interval between two presentations and a retention interval from second presentation to test for recall. It was found that the retention curve after a 0-sec. spacing interval was higher at the 2- and 4-sec. retention intervals than the retention curve after an 8-sec. spacing interval. However, at the 8- and 16-sec. retention intervals the superiority was reversed. If one assumes that the retention curve reflects retained amount of learning in a simple way, then the finding of poorer retention the longer the interval between presentations seems quite reasonable. The retention curve drops off rapidly after one presentation and hence when a second increment to associative strength is given after an interval the summed"

In accordance with Hebb's postulate for learning, repetitive postsynaptic spiking enabled enhancement in just those synapses that were eligible to change by virtue of concurrent presynaptic activity. However, the essential postsynaptic electrogenic event that controlled the enhancement was shown to involve biophysical processes that were unknown when Hebb formulated his neurophysiological postulate. The demonstrated spatiotemporal specificity of this pseudo-Hebbian conjunctive mechanism can account qualitatively for the known neurophysiological properties of associative long-term potentiation in these synapses, which in turn can explain the \"cooperativity\" requirement for long-term potentiation."

An extension of these ideas to massively parallel, connectionist models appears to offer a number of advantages. After a preliminary discussion, this paper introduces a general connectionist model and considers how it might be used in cognitive science. Among the issues addressed are: stability and noise-sensitivity, distributed decision-making, time and sequence problems, and the representation of complex concepts."
