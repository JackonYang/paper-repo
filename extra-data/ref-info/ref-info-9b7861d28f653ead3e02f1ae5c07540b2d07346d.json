This concept has recently gained support by the observation of stimulus-dependent oscillatory activity in the visual cortex of the cat. Furthermore, experimental evidence has been found showing the formation and segregation of synchronously oscillating cell assemblies in response to various stimulus conditions. In previous work, we have demonstrated that a network of neuronal oscillators coupled by synchronizing and desynchronizing delay connections can exhibit a temporal structure of responses, which closely resembles experimental observations. In this paper, we investigate the self-organization of synchronizing and desynchronizing coupling connections by local learning rules. Based on recent experimental observations, we modify synchronizing connections according to a two-threshold learning rule, involving synaptic potentiation and depression. This rule is generalized to its functional inverse for weight changes of desynchronizing connections. We show that after training, the resulting network exhibits stimulus-dependent formation and segregation of oscillatory assemblies in agreement with the experimental data. These results indicate that local learning rules during ontogenesis can suffice to develop a connectivity pattern in support of the observed temporal structure of stimulus responses in cat visual cortex."

The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established.

In particular, global stimulus properties could be reflected in the correlated firing of spatially distant cells. Here we describe how simple coupled oscillator networks can be used to model the data and to investigate whether useful tasks can be performed by oscillator architectures. A specific demonstration is given for the problem of preattentive texture discrimination. Texture images are convolved with different sets of Gabor filters feeding into several corresponding arrays of coupled oscillators. After a brief transient, the dynamic evolution in the arrays leads to a separation of the textures by a phase labeling mechanism. The importance of noise and of long range connections is briefly discussed."

This type of deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learns much faster than the equivalent stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM), but since the learning procedure for DBM's is only based on an analogy with SBM's, there is no existing proof that it performs gradient descent in any function, and it has only been justified by simulations. By using the appropriate interpretation for the way in which a DBM represents the probability of an output vector given an input vector, it is shown that the DBM performs steepest descent in the same function as the original SBM, except at rare discontinuities. A very simple way of forcing the weights to become symmetrical is also described, and this makes the DBM more biologically plausible than back-propagation (Werbos 1974; Parker 1985; Rumelhart et al. 1986)."

Recently, we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40\u201360 Hz (refs 1,2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed, feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field2,3. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has, on average, no phase difference, depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties."
