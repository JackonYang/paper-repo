A graph is formed by connecting all pairs of neighboring image pixels (voxels) by weighted edges. Certain pixels (voxels) have to be a priori identified as object or background seeds providing necessary clues about the image content. Our objective is to find the cheapest way to cut the edges in the graph so that the object seeds are completely separated from the background seeds. If the edge cost is a decreasing function of the local intensity gradient then the minimum cost cut should produce an object/background segmentation with compact boundaries along the high intensity gradient values in the image. An efficient, globally optimal solution is possible via standard min-cut/max-flow algorithms for graphs with two terminals. We applied this technique to interactively segment organs in various 2D and 3D medical images."

Our segmentation method proceeds by minimizing the ratio between the exterior boundary cost and the enclosed interior benefit using a computationally efficient graph partitioning algorithm. Our interest is motivated by very efficient algorithms for finding the globally optimum solution, and a desire to investigate how weak smoothness constraints may be globally imposed without disallowing very high local curvature. We analyze the performance of the approach, indicating both strengths and weaknesses, and discuss its connections with prior image partitioning algorithms. The relationship with snakes is discussed in detail and it is shown how to efficiently compute an approximation to common snakes under the additional constraint that it enclose a given point. When user interaction is available, there is a clear advantage to minimizing user interaction for purposes of improved speed and ease of use and for robustness. \"Ratio regions\" can accommodate several levels of user interaction and it is empirically shown that very coarse initializations can be tolerated. User interaction not only guides the algorithm to perceptually salient regions but can also be exploited to significantly reduce the computational cost."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

                "text": "Abstract In multidimensional image analysis, there are, and will continue to be, situations wherein automatic image segmentation methods fail, calling for considerable user assistance in the process. The main goals of segmentation research for such situations ought to be (i) to provideeffective controlto the user on the segmentation processwhileit is being executed, and (ii) to minimize the total user's time required in the process. With these goals in mind, we present in this paper two paradigms, referred to aslive wireandlive lane, for practical image segmentation in large applications. For both approaches, we think of the pixel vertices and oriented edges as forming a graph, assign a set of features to each oriented edge to characterize its ``boundariness,'' and transform feature values to costs. We provide training facilities and automatic optimal feature and transform selection methods so that these assignments can be made with consistent effectiveness in any application. In live wire, the user first selects an initial point on the boundary. For any subsequent point indicated by the cursor, an optimal path from the initial point to the current point is found and displayed in real time. The user thus has a live wire on hand which is moved by moving the cursor. If the cursor goes close to the boundary, the live wire snaps onto the boundary. At this point, if the live wire describes the boundary appropriately, the user deposits the cursor which now becomes the new starting point and the process continues. A few points (live-wire segments) are usually adequate to segment the whole 2D boundary. In live lane, the user selects only the initial point. Subsequent points are selected automatically as the cursor is moved within a lane surrounding the boundary whose width changes as a function of the speed and acceleration of cursor motion. Live-wire segments are generated and displayed in real time between successive points. The users get the feeling that the curve snaps onto the boundary as and while they roughly mark in the vicinity of the boundary. We describe formal evaluation studies to compare the utility of the new methods with that of manual tracing based on speed and repeatability of tracing and on data taken from a large ongoing application. The studies indicate that the new methods are statistically significantly more repeatable and 1.5\u20132.5 times faster than manual tracing."

Fully automated segmentation is an unsolved problem, while manual tracing is inaccurate and laboriously unacceptable. However, Intelligent Scissors allow objects within digital images to be extracted quickly and accurately using simple gesture motions with a mouse. When the gestured mouse position comes in proximity to an object edge, a live-wire boundary \u201csnaps\u201d to, and wraps around the object of interest. Live-wire boundary detection formulates boundary detection as an optimal path search in a weighted graph. Optimal graph searching provides mathematically piece-wise optimal boundaries while greatly reducing sensitivity to local noise or other intervening structures. Robustness is further enhanced with on-the-fly training which causes the boundary to adhere to the specific type of edge currently being followed, rather than simply the strongest edge in the neighborhood. Boundary cooling automatically freezes unchanging segments and automates input of additional seed points. Cooling also allows the user to be much more free with the gesture path, thereby increasing the efficiency and finesse with which boundaries can be extracted."

In voxel occupancy, the task is to produce a binary labeling of a set of voxels, that determines which voxels are filled and which are empty. In this paper, we give an energy minimization formulation of the voxel occupancy problem. The global minimum of this energy can be rapidly computed with a single graph cut, using a result due to D. Greig et al. (1989). The energy function we minimize contains a data term and a smoothness term. The data term is a sum over the individual voxels, where the penalty for a voxel is based on the observed intensities of the pixels that intersect it. The smoothness term is the number of empty voxels adjacent to filled ones. Our formulation can be viewed as a generalization of silhouette intersection, with two advantages: we do not compute silhouettes, which are a major source of errors; and we can naturally incorporate spatial smoothness. We give experimental results showing reconstructions from both real and synthetic imagery. Reconstruction using this smoothed energy function is not much more time consuming than simple silhouette intersection; it takes about 10 seconds to reconstruct a one million voxel volume."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth.

An alternative method based on the preflow concept of Karzanov is introduced. A preflow is like a flow, except that the total amount flowing into a vertex is allowed to exceed the total amount flowing out. The method maintains a preflow in the original network and pushes local flow excess toward the sink along what are estimated to be shortest paths. The algorithm and its analysis are simple and intuitive, yet the algorithm runs as fast as any other known method on dense. graphs, achieving an O(n)) time bound on an n-vertex graph. By incorporating the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan, we obtain a version of the algorithm running in O(nm log(n'/m)) time on an n-vertex, m-edge graph. This is as fast as any known method for any graph density and faster on graphs of moderate density. The algorithm also admits efticient distributed and parallel implementations. A parallel implementation running in O(n'log n) time using n processors and O(m) space is obtained. This time bound matches that of the Shiloach-Vishkin"
