It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web."

There are numerous applications for which subjectivity tagging is relevant, including information extraction and information retrieval. This paper identifies strong clues of subjectivity using the results of a method for clustering words according to distributional similarity (Lin 1998), seeded by a small amount of detailed manual annotation. These features are then further refined with the addition of lexical semantic features of adjectives, specifically polarity and gradability (Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown 1997), which can be automatically learned from corpora. In 10-fold cross validation experiments, features based on both similarity clusters and the lexical semantic features are shown to have higher precision than features based on each alone."

The primary linguistic resource for fuzzy semantic typing is the fuzzy affect lexicon, from which other important resources are generated, notably the fuzzy thesaurus and affect category groups. Free text is tagged with affect categories from the lexicon, and the affect categories' centralities and intensities are combined using techniques from fuzzy logic to produce affect sets fuzzy sets that represent the affect quality of a document. We show different aspects of affect analysis using news stories and movie reviews. Our experiments show a very good correspondence of affect sets with human judgments of affect content. We ascribe this to the effective representation of ambiguity in our fuzzy affect lexicon, and the ability of fuzzy logic to deal successfully with the ambiguity of words in natural language. Planned extensions of the system include personalized profiles for Web-based content dissemination, fuzzy retrieval, clustering and classification."

The method involves issuing queries to a Web search engine and using pointwise mutual information to analyse the results. The algorithm is empirically evaluated using a training corpus of approximately one hundred billion words \u0097 the subset of the Web that is indexed by the chosen search engine. Tested with 3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative), the algorithm attains an accuracy of 80%. The 3,596 test words include adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs. The accuracy is comparable with the results achieved by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), using a complex four-stage supervised learning algorithm that is restricted to determining the semantic orientation of adjectives."

We present a methodology for real time sentiment extraction in the domain of finance. With the advent of the web, there has been a sharp increase in the influence of individuals on the stock market via web-based trading and the posting of sentiment to stock message boards. While it is importantto capture this \"sentiment\" of small investors, as yet, no index of sentiment has been compiled. This paper comprises (a) a technology for extracting small investor sentiment from web sources to create an index, and (b) illustrative applications of the methodology. We make use of computerized natural language and statistical algorithms for the automated classification of messages posted on the web. We design a suite of classification algorithms, each of different theoretical content, with a view to characterizing the sentiment of any single posting to a message board. The use of multiple methods allows imposition of voting rules in the classification process. It also enables elimination of \"fuzzy\" messages which are better off uninterpreted. A majority rule across algorithms vastly improves classification accuracy, but also leads to a natural increase in the number of messages classified as \"fuzzy\". The classifier achieves an accuracy of 62% (versus a random classification accuracy of 33%), and compares favorably against human agreement on message classification, which was 72%. The technology is computationally efficient, allowing the access and interpretations of thousands of messages within minutes. Our illustrative applications show evidence of a strong link between market movements and sentiment. Based on approximately 25,000 messages for the last quarter of 2000, we found evidence that sentiment is based on stock movements."

A tagged corpus is built from the Internet in a bootstrapping process by providing a few hand-crafted examples of each question type to Altavista. Patterns are then automatically extracted from the returned documents and standardized. We calculate the precision of each pattern, and the average precision for each question type. These patterns are then applied to find answers to new questions. Using the TREC-10 question set, we report results for two cases: answers determined from the TREC-10 corpus and from the web."

Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as \"getting into a car accident\") to classify sentences into \"basic\" emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness implications.Open Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces."

Our problem domain consists of hyperlinks given in a form of small-documents represented with word vectors. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data. The best performance was achieved by the feature selection methods based on the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from information retrieval."

In particular, all previous dictionary construction systems for information extraction have used an annotated training corpus or some form of annotated input. We have developed a system called AutoSlog-TS that creates dictionaries of extraction patterns using only untagged text. AutoSlog-TS is based on the AutoSlog system, which generated extraction patterns using annotated text and a set of heuristic rules. By adapting AutoSlog and combining it with statistical techniques, we eliminated its dependency on tagged text. In experiments with the MUG-4 terrorism domain, AutoSlog-TS created a dictionary of extraction patterns that performed comparably to a dictionary created by AutoSlog, using only preclassified texts as input."

Instead of focusing on discovering documents that pertain to some topic of interest to the user, an approach is introduced based on the criterion of directionality (e.g., Is the agent in favor of, neutral, or opposed to the event?). A method is described for coercing sentence meanings into a metaphoric model such that the only semantic interpretation needed in order to determine the directionality of a sentence is done with respect to the model. This interpretation method is designed to be an integrated component of a hybrid information access system."

A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus."

                "text": "Bigrams and trigrams are commonly used in statistical natural language processing; this paper will describe techniques for working with much longer n-grams. Suffix arrays (Manber and Myers 1990) were first introduced to compute the frequency and location of a substring (n-gram) in a sequence (corpus) of length N. To compute frequencies over all N(N+1)/2 substrings in a corpus, the substrings are grouped into a manageable number of equivalence classes. In this way, a prohibitive computation over substrings is reduced to a manageable computation over classes. This paper presents both the algorithms and the code that were used to compute term frequency (tf) and document frequency (df) for all n-grams in two large corpora, an English corpus of 50 million words of Wall Street Journal and a Japanese corpus of 216 million characters of Mainichi Shimbun. The second half of the paper uses these frequencies to find interesting substrings. Lexicographers have been interested in n-grams with high mutual information (MI) where the joint term frequency is higher than what would be expected by chance, assuming that the parts of the n-gram combine independently. Residual inverse document frequency (RIDF) compares document frequency to another model of chance where terms with a particular term frequency are distributed randomly throughout the collection. MI tends to pick out phrases with noncompositional semantics (which often violate the independence assumption) whereas RIDF tends to highlight technical terminology, names, and good keywords for information retrieval (which tend to exhibit nonrandom distributions over documents). The combination of both MI and RIDF is better than either by itself in a Japanese word extraction task."

It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length."

By using efficient data structures, we extend the notion of PST to unbounded vocabularies. We also show how to use a Bayesian approach based on recursive priors over all possible PSTs to efficiently maintain tree mixtures. These mixtures have provably and practically better performance than almost any single model. Finally, we evaluate the model on several corpora. The low perplexity achieved by relatively small PST mixture models suggests that they may be an advantageous alternative, both theoretically and practically, to the widely used n-gram models."

We identify document genre is an important factor in retrieving useful documents and focus on the novel document genre dimension of subjectivity. We investigate three approaches to automatically classifying documents by genre: traditional bag of words techniques, part-of-speech statistics, and hand-crafted shallow linguistic features. We are particularly interested in domain transfer: how well the learned classifiers generalize from the training corpus to a new document corpus. Our experiments demonstrate that the part-of-speech approach is better than traditional bag of words techniques, particularly in the domain transfer conditions."
