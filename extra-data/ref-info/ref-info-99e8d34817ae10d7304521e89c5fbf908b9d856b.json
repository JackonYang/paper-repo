These models provide properly formulated, non-deficient, probability distributions over reordered phrase sequences. They are implemented by Weighted Finite State Transducers. We describe EM-style parameter re-estimation procedures based on phrase alignment under the complete translation model incorporating reordering. Our experiments show that the reordering model yields substantial improvements in translation performance on Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English MT tasks. We also show that the procedure scales as the bitext size is increased."

In the final evaluation, the statistical approach was found to perform best among five competing approaches.In this paper, we will further investigate the used statistical translation models. A shortcoming of the single-word based model is that it does not take contextual information into account for the translation decisions. We will present a translation model that is based on bilingual phrases to explicitly model the local context. We will show that this model performs better than the single-word based model. We will compare monotone and non-monotone search for this model and we will investigate the benefit of using the sum criterion instead of the maximum approximation."

                "text": "Manual development of large subcategorised lexicons has proved difficult because predicates change behaviour between sublanguages, domains and over time. Yet access to a comprehensive subcategorization lexicon is vital for successful parsing capable of recovering predicate-argument relations, and probabilistic parsers would greatly benefit from accurate information concerning the relative likelihood of different subcategorisation frames (scfs) of a given predicate. Acquisition of subcategorization lexicons from textual corpora has recently become increasingly popular. Although this work has met with some success, resulting lexicons indicate a need for greater accuracy. One significant source of error lies in the statistical filtering used for hypothesis selection, i.e. for removing noise from automatically acquired scfs. This thesis builds on earlier work in verbal subcategorization acquisition, taking as a starting point the problem with statistical filtering. Our investigation shows that statistical filters tend to work poorly because not only is the underlying distribution zipfian, but there is also very little correlation between conditional distribution of scfs specific to a verb and unconditional distribution regardless of the verb. More accurate back-off estimates are needed for scf acquisition than those provided by unconditional distribution. We explore whether more accurate estimates could be obtained by basing them on linguistic verb classes. Experiments are reported which show that in terms of scf distributions, individual verbs correlate more closely with syntactically similar verbs and even more closely with semantically similar verbs, than with all verbs in general. On the basis of this result, we suggest classifying verbs according to their semantic classes and obtaining back-off estimates specific to these classes. We propose a method for obtaining such semantically based back-off estimates, and a novel approach to hypothesis selection which makes use of these estimates. This approach involves automatically identifying the semantic class of a predicate, using subcategorization acquisition machinery to hypothesise conditional scf distribution for the predicate, smoothing the conditional distribution with the back-off estimates of the respective semantic verb class, and employing a simple method for filtering, which uses a threshold on the estimates from smoothing. Adopting Briscoe and Carroll\u2019s (1997) system as a framework, we demonstrate that this semantically-driven approach to hypothesis selection can significantly improve the accuracy of large-scale subcategorization acquisition."

In statistical machine translation, the conventional approach is to segment the Chinese character sequence into words during the pre-processing. The training and translation are performed afterwards. However, this method is not optimal for two reasons: 1. The segmentations may be erroneous. 2. For a given character sequence, the best segmentation depends on its context and translation. In order to minimize the translation errors, we take different segmentation alternatives instead of a single segmentation into account and integrate the segmentation process with the search for the best translation. The segmentation decision is only taken during the generation of the translation. With this method we are able to translate Chinese text at the character level. The experiments on the IWSLT 2005 task showed improvements in the translation performance using two translation systems: a phrase-based system and a finite state transducer based system. For the phrase-based system, the improvement of the BLEU score is 1.5% absolute."

                "text": "This article explores the possibilities of automatic extra ction of both surface and valency frames of Czech verbs. First, it is clearly documented that the data from Prague Dependency Treebank is not sufficient for collecting enough examples of verb frames to build a large scale lexicon. As a solution, an approach to pick nice examples of sentences from any texts is suggested and thoroughly described. A new scripting language to simplify the selection of sentences based on linguistic criteria was imp lemented and its main concepts are presented here, too. Also the problems of extracting surface and valency frames from the collected data are addressed and illustrated on real corpus data. 1 Motivation At the current stage of the development, the accuracy of syntactic analysers of natural languages (in particular Czech) is limited due to the lack of large and precise lexicons of syntactic behaviour of individual words (verb valency frames are the most important example). Although some electronically available lexicons of Czech verbs exist (BRIEF for example), the information provided was collected by hand and suffers an important problem: The theoretical background for the lexicons was purely linguistic and its explanation for computational issues is rather complicated. The lexicons are therefore updated and new ones are built reflecting a theory more precise in the computa tional field as well. Unfortunately building such lexicons by hand is rather a time-consuming task, so that any kind of automatic preprocessing would help. This article describes the overall scenario and the main problems of extracting verb frames from corpora. The presented work was done within the framework of Functional Generative Description (FGD 1 ). In section 2 I summarize the basic notions of FGD relevant to verb frames extraction. In the following sections 3, 4 and 5 the extraction process and its problems are explained."
