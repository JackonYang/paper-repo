While it is difficult to capture such inter-dependent features with a generative probabilistic model, conditionally-trained models, such as conditional maximum entropy models, handle them well.

On the other hand, unlabeled data (raw text) is often available \"for free\" in large quantities. Unlabeled data has shown promise in improving the performance of a number of tasks, e.g. word sense disambiguation, information extraction, and natural language parsing. In this thesis, we focus on two segmentation tasks, named-entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation. The goal of named-entity recognition is to detect and classify names of people, organizations, and locations in a sentence. The goal of Chinese word segmentation is to find the word boundaries in a sentence that has been written as a string of characters without spaces. Our approach is as follows: In a preprocessing step, we use raw text to cluster words and calculate mutual information statistics. The output of this step is then used as features in a supervised model, specifically a global linear model trained using the Perceptron algorithm. We also compare Markov and semi-Markov models on the two segmentation tasks. Our results show that features derived from unlabeled data substantially improves performance, both in terms of reducing the amount of labeled data needed to achieve a certain performance level and in terms of reducing the error using a fixed amount of labeled data. We find that sometimes semi-Markov models can also improve performance over Markov models. Thesis Supervisor: Michael Collins Title: Assistant Professor, CSAIL"

We first propose a simple yet powerful semi-supervised discriminative model appropriate for handling large scale unlabeled data. Then, we describe experiments performed on widely used test collections, namely, PTB III data, CoNLL\u201900 and \u201903 shared task data for the above three NLP tasks, respectively. We incorporate up to 1G-words (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data, which is the largest amount of unlabeled data ever used for these tasks, to investigate the performance improvement. In addition, our results are superior to the best reported results for all of the above test collections."

Consequently, they have difficulty estimating parameters for types which appear in the test set, but seldom (or never) appear in the training set. We demonstrate that distributional representations of word types, trained on unannotated text, can be used to improve performance on rare words. We incorporate aspects of these representations into the feature space of our sequence-labeling systems. In an experiment on a standard chunking dataset, our best technique improves a chunker from 0.76 F1 to 0.86 F1 on chunks beginning with rare words. On the same dataset, it improves our part-of-speech tagger from 74% to 80% accuracy on rare words. Furthermore, our system improves significantly over a baseline system when applied to text from a different domain, and it reduces the sample complexity of sequence labeling."

Using these ideas together, the resulting tagger gives a 97.24% accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ, an error reduction of 4.4% on the best previous single automatically learned tagging result."

To do this, we jointly perform parsing and semantic role labeling, using a probabilistic SRL system to rerank the results of a probabilistic parser.

We focus on the problem of lexical representation, introducing features that incorporate word clusters derived from a large unannotated corpus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a series of dependency parsing experiments on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, and we show that the cluster-based features yield substantial gains in performance across a wide range of conditions. For example, in the case of English unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 92.02% to 93.16%, and in the case of Czech unlabeled second-order parsing, we improve from a baseline accuracy of 86.13% to 87.13%. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also improves performance when small amounts of training data are available, and can roughly halve the amount of supervised data required to reach a desired level of performance."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

In the process of comparing several solutions to these challenges we reach some surprising conclusions, as well as develop an NER system that achieves 90.8 F1 score on the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task, the best reported result for this dataset."

Training is performed by computing gradients of a global objective function with respect to all the parameters in the system using a kind of back-propagation procedure. A complete check reading system based on these concepts is described. The system uses convolutional neural network character recognizers, combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is presently deployed commercially and reads million of checks per month."

Therefore, we want to transfer learning from the old, general-purpose subtask to a more specific new task, for which there is often less data. While work in transfer learning often considers how the old task should affect learning on the new task, in this paper we show that it helps to take into account how the new task affects the old. Specifically, we perform joint decoding of separately-trained sequence models, preserving uncertainty between the tasks and allowing information from the new task to affect predictions on the old task. On two standard text data sets, we show that joint decoding outperforms cascaded decoding."

CRFs are log-linear, allowing the incorporation of arbitrary features into the model. To train on unlabeled data, we require unsupervised estimation methods for log-linear models; few exist. We describe a novel approach, contrastive estimation. We show that the new technique can be intuitively understood as exploiting implicit negative evidence and is computationally efficient. Applied to a sequence labeling problem---POS tagging given a tagging dictionary and unlabeled text---contrastive estimation outperforms EM (with the same feature set), is more robust to degradations of the dictionary, and can largely recover by modeling additional features."

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

Compared to the well known N-gram language models, discriminative language models can achieve more accurate discrimination because they can employ overlapping features and nonlocal information. However, discriminative language models have been used only for re-ranking in specific applications because negative examples are not available. We propose sampling pseudo-negative examples taken from probabilistic language models. However, this approach requires prohibitive computational cost if we are dealing with quite a few features and training samples. We tackle the problem by estimating the latent information in sentences using a semiMarkov class model, and then extracting features from them. We also use an online margin-based algorithm with efficient kernel computation. Experimental results show that pseudo-negative examples can be treated as real negative examples and our model can classify these sentences correctly."

Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing, shallow parsing has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and extensive comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to achieve performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on the CoNLL task, and better than any reported single model. Improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results. We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy models."

Such tasks include sentence splitting, tokenization, named-entity extraction, and chunking. We present a new model of text segmentation based on ideas from multilabel classification. Using this model, we can naturally represent segmentation problems involving overlapping and non-contiguous segments. We evaluate the model on entity extraction and noun-phrase chunking and show that it is more accurate for overlapping and non-contiguous segments, but it still performs well on simpler data sets for which sequential tagging has been the best method."

In this paper we show that the latent-dynamics (i.e., hidden substructure of shallow phrases) constitutes a problem in shallow parsing, and we show that modeling this intermediate structure is useful. By analyzing the automatically learned hidden states, we show how the latent conditional model explicitly learn latent-dynamics. We propose in this paper the Best Label Path (BLP) inference algorithm, which is able to produce the most probable label sequence on latent conditional models. It outperforms two existing inference algorithms. With the BLP inference, the LDCRF model significantly outperforms CRF models on word features, and achieves comparable performance of the most successful shallow parsers on the CoNLL data when further using part-of-speech features."

Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting."

In this paper we show how to use corpus statistics to validate and correct the arguments of extracted relation instances, improving the overall RE performance. We test the methods on SRES \u2013 a self-supervised Web relation extraction system.

This represents a 13% decrease in error rate over the best single-parser results on this corpus [9]. The major technical innovation is the use of a \"maximum-entropy-inspired\" model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events. We also present some partial results showing the effects of different conditioning information, including a surprising 2% improvement due to guessing the lexical head's pre-terminal before guessing the lexical head."

Instead it depends on the characteristics of the output candidates that make downstream problems easier or harder. Motivated by this observation, we suggest an effective and simple approach of combining different semantic role labeling systems through joint inference, which significantly improves the performance."

For an input sentence, syntactic constituent structure parses are generated by a Charniak parser and a Collins parser. Semantic role labels are assigned to the constituents of each parse using Support Vector Machine classifiers. The resulting semantic role labels are converted to an IOB representation. These IOB representations are used as additional features, along with flat syntactic chunks, by a chunking SVM classifier that produces the final SRL output. This strategy for combining features from three different syntactic views gives a significant improvement in performance over roles produced by using any one of the syntactic views individually."

Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201cnone of the above\u201d. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, \u201cartifact\u201d. Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."

The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples. Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models."

Joint decoding invariably works by considering additional probabilistic dependency paths between the models. Therefore it defines an implicit supermodel that describes all the tasks in the same probabilistic framework. Separately training a submodel only makes sense when the training data blocks these additional dependency paths (in the sense of d-separation, Pearl, 1988). This implies that, without joint training, the additional dependency paths cannot directly involve unobserved variables. Therefore, the natural idea of discovering common internal representations across tasks requires joint training. Joint training is relatively straightforward when the training sets for the individual tasks contain the same patterns with different labels. It is then sufficient to train a model that computes multiple outputs for each pattern (Suddarth and Holden, 1991). Using this scheme, Sutton et al. (2007) demonstrate improvements on POS tagging and noun-phrase chunking using jointly trained CRFs."

We define a random field over the structure of each sentence's syntactic parse tree. For each node of the tree, the model must predict a semantic role label, which is interpreted as the labelling for the corresponding syntactic constituent. We show how modelling the task as a tree labelling problem allows for the use of efficient CRF inference algorithms, while also increasing generalisation performance when compared to the equivalent maximum entropy classifier. We have participated in the CoNLL-2005 shared task closed challenge with full syntactic information."

We show that previously reported comparisons greatly under-estimated the performance of context-free parsers for these tasks. We also demonstrate that context-free parsers can train effectively on relatively little training data, and are more robust to domain shift for shallow parsing tasks than has been previously reported. Finally, we establish that combining the output of context-free and finite-state parsers gives much higher results than the previous-best published results, on several common tasks. While the efficiency benefit of finite-state models is inarguable, the results presented here show that the corresponding cost in accuracy is higher than previously thought."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

We present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), a generalization of linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) in which each time slice contains a set of state variables and edges---a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs)---and parameters are tied across slices. Since exact inference can be intractable in such models, we perform approximate inference using several schedules for belief propagation, including tree-based reparameterization (TRP). On a natural-language chunking task, we show that a DCRF performs better than a series of linear-chain CRFs, achieving comparable performance using only half the training data."

We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

The resulting resource can be thought of as shallow, in that it does not represent coreference, quantification, and many other higher-order phenomena, but also broad, in that it covers every instance of every verb in the corpus and allows representative statistics to be calculated. We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus. We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty trace categories of the treebank."

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

The paper presents an analysis of why TSVMs are well suited for text classi cation. These theoretical ndings are supported by experiments on three test collections. The experiments show substantial improvements over inductive methods, especially for small training sets, cutting the number of labeled training examples down to a twentieth on some tasks.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Drawing on interviews with Reuters personnel and access to Reuters documentation, we describe the coding policy and quality control procedures used in producing the RCV1 data, the intended semantics of the hierarchical category taxonomies, and the corrections necessary to remove errorful data. We refer to the original data as RCV1-v1, and the corrected data as RCV1-v2. We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illustrating the collection's properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies. We make available detailed, per-category experimental results, as well as corrected versions of the category assignments and taxonomy structures, via online appendices."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

This follows from a number of observations: firstly, the original human experiments used only 27 character English (letters plus space) against full 128 character ASCII text for most computer experiments; secondly, using large amounts of priming text substantially improves the PPM's performance; and thirdly, the PPM algorithm can be modified to perform better for English text. The result of this is a machine performance down to 1.46 bit per character. The problem of estimating the entropy of English is discussed. The importance of training text for PPM is demonstrated, showing that its performance can be improved by \"adjusting\" the alphabet used. The results based on these improvements are then given, with compression down to 1.46 bpc."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."

The grammar is comprised of a set of rules whose goal is twofold: first these rules can be used to create sentences of the associated language and only these, and second they can be used to classify whether a given sentence is an element of the language or not. The goal of a linguist is to discover grammars that are simple and yet are able to fully span the language. In [1] Chomsky describes three possible options of increasing complexity for English grammars: Finite-state, Phrase Structure and Transformational. This paper briefly present these three grammars and summarizes Chomsky\u2019s analysis and results which state that finite-state grammars are inadequate because they fail to span all possible sentences of the English language, and phrase structure grammar is overly complex."

Here we consider the problem of learning how to order instances given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a binary preference function indicating whether it is advisable to rank one instance before another. Here we consider an on-line algorithm for learning preference functions that is based on Freund and Schapire's \"Hedge\" algorithm. In the second stage, new instances are ordered so as to maximize agreement with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a learned preference function is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we describe simple greedy algorithms that are guaranteed to find a good approximation. Finally, we show how metasearch can be formulated as an ordering problem, and present experimental results on learning a combination of \"search experts,\" each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a web search engine."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Since many of these results are close variants, we first describe the main approaches behind them. Then, we will move to describing each individual result. The core components of the solution are published in our ICDM'2007 paper [1] (or, KDD-Cup'2007 paper [2]), and also in the earlier KDD'2007 paper [3]. We assume that the reader is familiar with these works and our terminology there. A movie-oriented k-NN approach was thoroughly described in our KDD-Cup'2007 paper [kNN]. We apply it as a post-processor for most other models. Interestingly, it was most effective when applied on residuals of RBMs [5], thereby driving the Quiz RMSE from 0.9093 to 0.8888. An earlier k-NN approach was described in the KDD'2007 paper ([3], Sec. 3) [Slow-kNN]. It appears that this earlier approach can achieve slightly more accurate results than the newer one, at the expense of a significant increase in running time. Consequently, we dropped the older approach, though some results involving it survive within the final blend. We also tried more na\u00efve k-NN models, where interpolation weights are based on pairwise similarities between movies (see [2], Sec. 2.2). Specifically, we based weights on corr 2 /(1-corr 2) [Corr-kNN], or on mse-10 [MSE-kNN]. Here, corr is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two respective movies, and mse is the mean squared distance between two movies (see definition of s ij in Sec. 4.1 of [2]). We also tried taking the interpolation weights as the \"support-based similarities\", which will be defined shortly [Supp-kNN]. Other variants that we tried for computing the interpolation coefficients are: (1) using our KDD-Cup'2007 [2] method on a binary user-movie matrix, which replaces every rating with \" 1 \" , and sets non-rated user-movie pairs to \" 0 \" [Bin-kNN]. (2) Taking results of factorization, and regressing the factors associated with the target movie on the factors associated with its neighbors. Then, the resulting regression coefficients are used as interpolation weights [Fctr-kNN]. As explained in our papers, we also tried user-oriented k-NN approaches. Either in a profound way (see: [1], Sec. 4.3; [3], Sec. 5) [User-kNN], or by just taking weights as pairwise similarities among users [User-MSE-kNN], which is the user-oriented parallel of the aforementioned [MSE-kNN]. Prior to computing interpolation weights, one has to choose the set of neighbors. We find the most similar neighbors based on an appropriate similarity measure. In \u2026"

We propose a methodology based on the construction of real-valued scoring functions. We study empirical risk minimization of dedicated statistics which involve empirical quantiles of the scores. We first state the problem of finding the best instances which can be cast as a classification problem with mass constraint. Next, we develop special performance measures for the local ranking problem which extend the Area Under an ROC Curve (AUC) criterion and describe the optimal elements of these new criteria. We also highlight the fact that the goal of ranking the best instances cannot be achieved in a stage-wise manner where first, the best instances would be tentatively identified and then a standard AUC criterion could be applied. Eventually, we state preliminary statistical results for the local ranking problem."

Combining multiple systems or tweaking carefully features is also a common approach, like in the chunking top system (Shen and Sarkar, 2005). However, when comparing systems, we do not learn anything of the quality of each system if they were trained with different labeled data. For that reason, we will refer to benchmark systems, that is, top existing systems which avoid usage of external data and have been well-established in the NLP field: Toutanova et al.

These diverse areas echo the classes of models which conveniently describe each corresponding system. Thus although there can hardly be a \"general theory of adaptive systems\" encompassing both the modelling task and the design of the adaptation procedure, nevertheless, these diverse issues have a major common component: namely the use of adaptive algorithms, also known as stochastic approximations in the mathematical statistics literature, that is to say the adaptation procedure (once all modelling problems have been resolved). The juxtaposition of these two expressions in the title reflects the ambition of the authors to produce a reference work, both for engineers who use these adaptive algorithms and for probabilists or statisticians who would like to study stochastic approximations in terms of problems arising from real applications. Hence the book is organised in two parts, the first one user-oriented, and the second providing the mathematical foundations to support the practice described in the first part. The book covers the topcis of convergence, convergence rate, permanent adaptation and tracking, change detection, and is illustrated by various realistic applications originating from these areas of applications."

Thus, the derivatives of the cost with respect to the model parameters are either zero, or are undefined. In this paper, we propose a class of simple, flexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difficulties by working with implicit cost functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the resulting implicit cost function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for significantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions."
