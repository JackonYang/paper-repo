A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

                "text": "This thesis is concerned with the problem of visual object categorization, that is of reeognizing unseen-before objects, localizing them in cluttered real-worid images, and assigning the correct category label. This capability is one of the core compe\u00ac tencies of the human visual system. Yet, Computer vision Systems are still far from reaching a comparable level of Performance.Moreover,Computer visionresearch has in the past mainly focused on the simpler and more specific problem of identifying known objects under novel viewing conditions. The visual categorization problem is closely linked to the task of figure-ground segmentation, that is of dividing the image into an object and a non-objeet part. Historically, figure-ground segmentation has often been seen as an important and even necessary preprocessing step for object recognition. However, purely bottomup approacheshave so far been unable to yield segmentationsof sufficient quality, so that most current recognition approacheshave been designed to work independently from segmentation. In contrast,this thesis considers object categorization and figure-ground segmen\u00ac tation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. The core part of our work is a probabilisticformulation which integrates both capabilities into a common framework. As shown in our experiments, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to profit from each other and improve their individual Performances. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically compute a segmentationfor them. This segmenta\u00ac tion is then used to again improve recognition by allowing the System to focus its effort on object pixels and discard misleading influencesfrom the background. In addition to improving the recognition Performance for individual hypotheses, the top-down segmentation also allows to determine exactly from where a hypoth\u00ac esis draws its support. We use this information to design a hypothesis verification stage based on the MDL principle that resolves ambiguities between overlapping hypotheseson a per-pixel level and factorsout the effects of partialocclusion. Altogether, this procedureconstitutes a novel mechanismin object detection that allows to analyze scenes containing multiple objects in a principled manner. Our results show that it presents an improvement over conventional criteria based on bounding box overlap and permitsmore aecurate aeeeptancedecisions. Our approach is based on a highly flexible implicit representation for object shape that can combine the information of local parts observed on different training exam\u00ac ples and interpolate between the correspondingobjects. As a result, the proposed method can learn object modeis already from few training examples and achieve competitive object detection Performance with training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable Systems. An extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the system is applicable to many different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects."

To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

However, these approaches fail when these factors are too strong, due to the limited repeatability and discriminative power of the features. As additional shortcomings, the objects need to be rigid and only their approximate location is found. We present a novel Object Recognition approach which overcomes these limitations. An initial set of feature correspondences is first generated. The method anchors on it and then gradually explores the surrounding area, trying to construct more and more matching features, increasingly farther from the initial ones. The resulting process covers the object with matches, and simultaneously separates the correct matches from the wrong ones. Hence, recognition and segmentation are achieved at the same time. Only very few correct initial matches suffice for reliable recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the stronger power of the presented method in dealing with extensive clutter, dominant occlusion, large scale and viewpoint changes. Moreover non-rigid deformations are explicitly taken into account, and the approximative contours of the object are produced. The approach can extend any viewpoint invariant feature extractor."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

It will be seen that this is related in turn to methods for learning sprite based representations of an image. The method we describe involves a new generative model for performing segmentation on a set of images. Included in this model are the effects of motion blur and occlusion. An initial estimate of the parameters of the model is obtained by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components. The estimate of the matte of each part is refined using a variation of the \u03b1-expansion graph cut algorithm. This method has the advantage of achieving a strong local minimum over labels. Results are demonstrated on animals for which an articulated LPS representation is naturally suited."

In the light of our experiments, we suggest improvements to the shape context: shape contexts are used to find corresponding features between model and image. In real images it is shown that the shape context is highly influenced by clutters; furthermore, even when the object is correctly localized, the feature correspondence may be poor. We show that the robustness of shape matching can be increased by including a figural continuity constraint. The combined shape and continuity cost is minimized using the Viterbi algorithm on features, resulting in improved localization and correspondence. Our algorithm can be generally applied to any feature based shape matching method. Chamfer matching correlates model templates with the distance transform of the edge image. This can be done efficiently using a coarse-to-fine search over the transformation parameters. The method is robust in clutter, however, multiple templates are needed to handle scale, rotation and shape variation. We compare both methods for locating hand shapes in cluttered images, and applied to word recognition in EZ-Gimpy images."

The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

The process is reformulated in a linear vector space and the role of the different subspaces is emphasized. Within this framework wellknown artifacts of the gradient-based edge detectors, such as large spurious responses can be explained quantitatively. It is also shown that template matching with a template derived from the input data is meaningful since it provides an independent measure of confidence in the presence of the employed edge model. The widely used three-step edge detection procedure - gradient estimation, non-maxima suppression, hysteresis thresholding - is generalized to include the information provided by the confidence measure. The additional amount of computation is minimal and experiments with several standard test images show the ability of the new procedure to detect weak edges."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik, Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman."

Our method is based on automatically clustering the body pose space into connected regions exhibiting similar dynamical characteristics, modelling the dynamics in each region as a Gaussian autoregressive process. Activities that would require large numbers of exemplars in example based methods are covered by comparatively few motion models. Different regions correspond roughly to different action-fragments and our class inference scheme allows for smooth transitions between these, thus making it useful for activity recognition tasks. The method is used to track activities including walking, running, etc., using a planar 2D body model. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its success in tracking complicated motions like turns, without any key frames or 3D information."

Such queries are useful in the increasingly important problems of multimedia identification and retrieval, where different database entries have different metrics for similarity. While the database literature has focused on indexing for high-dimensional nearest neighbor and epsilon range queries, indexing for point queries against high-dimensional regions has not been addressed. We present an efficient indexing method for these queries, which relies on the combination of redundancy and bit vector indexing to achieve significant performance gains. We have implemented our approach in a real-world audio fingerprinting system, and have obtained a factor of 56 speed-up over linear scan. Furthermore, the well-known Hilbert bulk-loaded R-Trees, a technique capable of searching low-dimensional regions, are shown to be ineffective in our audio fingerprinting system, because of the inherently high-dimensional properties of the problem."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
