The texts to be indexed are abstracts written in English. The system of descriptors is prescribed. For the application of the AIR/PHYS system a large-scale dictionary containing more than 600 000 word-descriptor relations reap. phrase-descriptor relations has been developed. Most of these relations have been obtained by means of statistical and heuristical methods. In consequence, the relation system is rather imperfect. Therefore, the indexing system needs some fault- tolerating features. An appropriate indexing approach and the corresponding structure of the AIR/PHYS system are described.

If only a subset of the terms in the collection is to be included in the dictionary, the completeness of the dictionary can be optimized with respect to dictionary size.\nIn this paper, formulas for the relationship between the frequency distribution of the terms in the collection and expected dictionary completeness are derived. First we regard one-dimensional dictionaries where the (non-trivial) terms occurring in the texts are to be included in the dictionary. Then we describe the case of two-dimensional dictionaries, which are needed for example for automatic indexing with a controlled vocabulary; here relationships between text terms and descriptors from the prescribed vocabulary have to be stored in the dictionary. For both cases, formulas for the interpolation and extrapolation with respect to different collection sizes are derived.\nWe give experimental results for one-dimensional dictionaries and show how the completeness can be estimated and optimized."

Its main concern is with the weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."

The major problem in employing this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. Consequently, earlier researchers made the assumption that the vectors corresponding to terms are pairwise orthogonal. Such an assumption is clearly unrealistic. Although attempts have been made to compensate for this assumption by some separate, corrective steps, such methods are ad hoc and, in most cases, formally inconsistent.\nIn this paper, a generalization of the VSM, called the GVSM, is advanced. The developments provide a solution not only for the computation of a measure of similarity (correlation) between terms, but also for the incorporation of these similarities into the retrieval process.\nThe major strength of the GVSM derives from the fact that it is theoretically sound and elegant. Furthermore, experimental evaluation of the model on several test collections indicates that the performance is better than that of the VSM. Experiments have been performed on some variations of the GVSM, and all these results have also been compared to those of the VSM, based on inverse document frequency weighting. These results and some ideas for the efficient implementation of the GVSM are discussed."

The architecture makes use of the probabilistic networks technology for representing and reasoning about concepts and includes a knowledge acquisition component which partially automates the construction of concept knowledge bases from data. We describe two experiments that apply the architecture to the task of retrieving documents about terrorism from a set of documents from the Reuters news service. The experiments provide positive evidence that the architecture design is feasible and that there are advantages to concept-based methods."

The successes of these models are unlikely to be accidental; it is of interest therefore to examine the similarities between the two models. The disadvantage of the BLE model is the exponential number of terms appearings in the full expression, while a truncated BLE system may produce negative probability values. The disadvantage of the tree dependence model is the restriction to dependencies between certain term pairs only and the exclusion of higher-order dependencies. A generalized term dependence model is introduced in this study which does not carry the disadvantages of either the tree dependence or the BLE models. Sample evaluation results are included to demonstrate the usefulness of the generalized system."

Then we describe an approach for the development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions: request-document pairs (<italic>f<subscrpt>l</subscrpt></italic>, <italic>d<subscrpt>m</subscrpt></italic>) are mapped onto description vectors <italic>x</italic>(<italic>f<subscrpt>l</subscrpt></italic>, <italic>d<subscrpt>m</subscrpt></italic>), and a polynomial function <italic>e</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is developed such that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance P(<italic>R</italic> | x (<italic>f<subscrpt>l</subscrpt></italic>, <italic>d<subscrpt>m</subscrpt></italic>) with minimum square errors. We give experimental results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations. In contrast to other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests, and it can be easily applied to multivalued relevance scales. On the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

This paper presents a new approach which bypasses these difficulties and can acquire statistical knowledge from incomplete mixed-mode data. The proposed method adopts an event-covering approach which covers a subset of statistically relevant outcomes in the outcome space of variable-pairs. And once the covered event patterns are acquired, subsequent analysis tasks such as probabilistic inference, cluster analysis, and detection of event patterns for each cluster based on the incomplete probability scheme can be performed. There are four phases in our method: 1) the discretization of the continuous components based on a maximum entropy criterion so that the data can be treated as n-tuples of discrete-valued features; 2) the estimation of the missing values using our newly developed inference procedure; 3) the initial formation of clusters by analyzing the nearest-neighbor distance on subsets of selected samples; and 4) the reclassification of the n-tuples into more reliable clusters based on the detected interdependence relationships. For performance evaluation, experiments have been conducted using both simulated and real life data."

After an outline of the inductive inference machinery used, the paper reports on trials leading to correct and very fast attribute-based rules for the relations lost 2-ply and lost 3-ply. On another tack, a model of the performance of an idealized induction system is developed and its somewhat surprising predictions compared with observed results. The paper ends with a description of preliminary work on the automatic specification of relevant attributes."
