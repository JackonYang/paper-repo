                "text": "The Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model have been successfully applied to a num- ber of image labeling problems, including image segmenta- tion. However, existing HCRF models of image segmenta- tion do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly lim- its the impact of information at higher scales. Since class- label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new con- sistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential. It can encode any possible com- bination of labels, penalizing only unlikely combinations of classes. We also propose an effective sampling strategy over this expanded label set that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Our approach obtains state-of-the- art results on two challenging, standard benchmark datasets"

One reason is their ability to incorporate contextual information at different scales. However, these models do not allow multiple labels to be assigned to a single node. At higher scales in the image, this yields an oversimplified model, since multiple classes can be reasonable expected to appear within one region. This simplified model especially limits the impact that observations at larger scales may have on the CRF model. Neglecting the information at larger scales is undesirable since class-label estimates based on these scales are more reliable than at smaller, noisier scales. To address this problem, we propose a new potential, called harmony potential, which can encode any possible combination of class labels. We propose an effective sampling strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Pascal VOC 2009 and MSRC-21."

For accurate labeling it is important to capture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features and features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly, traditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and troublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets with many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the log-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy Belief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to the log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size. Our experimental results show that effective models can be learned from fragmentary labelings and that incorporating top-down aggregate features significantly improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art on three different image datasets."

One important type of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying \u201ctree\u201d pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more likely to be \u201csky\u201d whereas pixels below are more likely to be \u201cgrass.\u201d Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence, cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art."

However, existing HCRF models of image segmentation do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly limits the impact of information at higher scales. Since class-label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new consistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential. It can encode any possible combination of labels, penalizing only unlikely combinations of classes. We also propose an effective sampling strategy over this expanded label set that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging, standard benchmark datasets for semantic image segmentation: PASCAL VOC 2010, and MSRC-21."

Within the latter, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are prominently used for their ability to represent interactions between random variables. Despite their popularity in computer vision, parameter learning for CRFs has remained difficult, popular approaches being cross-validation and piecewise training. \n \nIn this work, we propose a simple yet expressive tree-structured CRF based on a recent hierarchical image segmentation method. Our model combines and weights multiple image features within a hierarchical representation and allows simple and efficient globally-optimal learning of \u2245 105 parameters. The tractability of our model allows us to pose and answer some of the open questions regarding parameter learning applying to CRF-based approaches. The key findings for learning CRF models are, from the obvious to the surprising, i) multiple image features always help, ii) the limiting dimension with respect to current models is the amount of training data, iii) piecewise training is competitive, iv) current methods for max-margin training fail for models with many parameters."

In order to improve performance, recent methods have begun to incorporate top-down cues, or object information, into segmentation. In this paper, we propose an approach to utilizing category-based information in segmentation, through a formulation as an image labelling problem. Our approach exploits bottom-up image cues to create an over-segmented representation of an image. The segments are then merged by assigning labels that correspond to the object category. The model is trained on a database of images, and is designed to be modular: it learns a number of image contexts, which simplify training and extend the range of object classes and image database size that the system can handle. The learning method estimates model parameters by maximizing a lower bound of the data likelihood. We examine performance on three real-world image databases, and compare our system to a standard classifier and other conditional random field approaches, as well as a bottom-up segmentation method."

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use \u2013 a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels \u2013 and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very practical. Experiments show that our approach produces superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a segmentation quality equal to or greater than four state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already been shown to increase performance over pixel-based methods."

However, as they consider objects as loose collections of local patches they fail to accurately locate object boundaries and are not able to produce accurate object segmentation. On the other hand, Markov random field models used for image segmentation focus on object boundaries but can hardly use the global constraints necessary to deal with object categories whose appearance may vary significantly. In this paper we combine the advantages of both approaches. First, a mechanism based on local regions allows object detection using visual word occurrences and produces a rough image segmentation. Then, a MRF component gives clean boundaries and enforces label consistency, guided by local image cues (color, texture and edge cues) and by long-distance dependencies. Gibbs sampling is used to infer the model. The proposed method successfully segments object categories with highly varying appearances in the presence of cluttered backgrounds and large view point changes. We show that it outperforms published results on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset."

It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results."

Although the choice of the pairwise similarity metric (or affinities) greatly influences the quality of the results, this choice is typically specified outside the learning framework. In this paper, we present an algorithm to learn class-specific similarity functions. Mapping our problem in a conditional random fields (CRF) framework enables us to pose the task of learning affinities as parameter learning in undirected graphical models. There are two significant advances over previous work. First, we learn the affinity between a pair of data-points as a function of a pairwise feature and (in contrast with previous approaches) the classes to which these two data-points were mapped, allowing us to work with a richer class of affinities. Second, our formulation provides a principled probabilistic interpretation for learning all of the parameters that define these affinities. Using ground truth segmentations and labellings for training, we learn the parameters with the greatest discriminative power (in an MLE sense) on the training data. We demonstrate the power of this learning algorithm in the setting of joint segmentation and recognition of object classes. Specifically, even with very simple appearance features, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets."

Decisions are performed based on continuous estimates of the spatial overlap between image segment hypotheses and each putative class. We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in framing recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs-all winning margin that can scramble ordering inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, learning produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses spatially overlap with the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape and PASCAL VOC 2009."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

The introduction of graph cuts has enabled efficient and optimal inference in associative random fields, greatly advancing applications such as segmentation, stereo reconstruction and many others. However, while fast inference is now widespread, parameter learning in random fields has remained an intractable problem. This paper shows how to apply fast inference algorithms, in particular graph cuts, to learn parameters of random fields with similar efficiency. We find optimal parameter values under standard regularized objective functions that ensure good generalization. Our algorithm enables learning of many parameters in reasonable time, and we explore further speedup techniques. We also discuss extensions to non-associative and multi-class problems. We evaluate the method on image segmentation and geometry recognition."

We present an approach to multi-class segmentation which combines two methods for this integration: a Conditional Random Field (CRF) which couples to local image features and an image classification method which considers global features. The CRF follows the approach of Reynolds & Murphy (2007) and is based on an unsupervised multi scale pre-segmentation of the image into patches, where patch labels correspond to the random variables of the CRF. The output of the classifier is used to constraint this CRF. We demonstrate and compare the approach on a standard semantic segmentation data set."

Specifically, we introduce a class of higher order clique potentials and show that the expansion and swap moves for any energy function composed of these potentials can be found by minimizing a submodular function. We also show that for a subset of these potentials, the optimal move can be found by solving an st-mincut problem. We refer to this subset as the P3 Potts model. Our results enable the use of powerful move making algorithms i.e. alpha-expansion and alphabeta-swap for minimization of energy functions involving higher order cliques. Such functions have the capability of modelling the rich statistics of natural scenes and can be used for many applications in computer vision. We demonstrate their use on one such application i.e. the texture based video segmentation problem."

The learned model is used for automatic visual understanding and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits texture-layout filters, novel features based on textons, which jointly model patterns of texture and their spatial layout. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating the unary classifier in a conditional random field, which (i) captures the spatial interactions between class labels of neighboring pixels, and (ii) improves the segmentation of specific object instances. Efficient training of the model on large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.\n\nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy is demonstrated on four varied databases: (i) the MSRC 21-class database containing photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, (ii) the 7-class Corel subset and (iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in He et\u00a0al. (Proceeding of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, vol.\u00a02, pp.\u00a0695\u2013702, June 2004), and (iv) a set of video sequences of television shows. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for objects that are highly textured (grass, trees, etc.), highly structured (cars, faces, bicycles, airplanes, etc.), and even articulated (body, cow, etc.).\n"

We regularize this classifier by aggregating histograms in the neighborhood of each superpixel and then refine our results further by using the classifier in a conditional random field operating on the superpixel graph.

Focusing on structural SVMs, we provide and explore algorithms for two different classes of approximate training algorithms, which we call undergenerating (e.g., greedy) and overgenerating (e.g., relaxations) algorithms. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of both types of approximate trained structural SVMs, focusing on fully connected pairwise Markov random fields.

Specifically, we introduce a class of higher order clique potentials and show that the expansion and swap moves for any energy function composed of these potentials can be found by minimizing a submodular function. We also show that for a subset of these potentials, the optimal move can be found by solving an st-mincut problem. We refer to this subset as the Pn Potts model. Our results enable the use of powerful move making algorithms i.e. \u03b1-expansion and \u03b1\u03b2-swap for minimization of energy functions involving higher order cliques. Such functions have the capability of modelling the rich statistics of natural scenes and can be used for many applications in computer vision. We demonstrate their use on one such application i.e. the texture based video segmentation problem."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Our approach, named CoLA (for co-occurrence, location and appearance), uses a conditional random field (CRF) to maximize object label agreement according to both semantic and spatial relevance. We model relative location between objects using simple pairwise features. By vector quantizing this feature space, we learn a small set of prototypical spatial relationships directly from the data. We evaluate our results on two challenging datasets: PASCAL 2007 and MSRC. The results show that combining co-occurrence and spatial context improves accuracy in as many as half of the categories compared to using co-occurrence alone."

We show that even on a very simple example, online EM can get stuck in local minima, which causes the robot to get \"lost\" and the resulting map to be useless. By contrast, the Bayesian approach, by maintaining multiple hypotheses, is much more robust. We then introduce a method for approximating the Bayesian solution, called Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering. We show that this approximation, when coupled with an active learning strategy, is fast but accurate."

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Recent progress in kernel-based methods has focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations. This paper addresses the complementary issue of problems involving complex outputs such as multiple dependent output variables and structured output spaces. We propose to generalize multiclass Support Vector Machine learning in a formulation that involves features extracted jointly from inputs and outputs. The resulting optimization problem is solved efficiently by a cutting plane algorithm that exploits the sparseness and structural decomposition of the problem. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method on problems ranging from supervised grammar learning and named-entity recognition, to taxonomic text classification and sequence alignment."
