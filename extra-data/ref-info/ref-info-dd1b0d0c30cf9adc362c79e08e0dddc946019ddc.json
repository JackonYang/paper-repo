                "text": "This thesis develops a mathematical basis for understanding the structure of on-line handwritten documents and explores some of the related problems in detail. With the increase in popularity of portable computing devices, such as PDAs and handheld computers, non-keyboard based methods for data entry are receiving more attention in the research communities and commercial sector. The most promising options are pen-based and speech-based inputs. Pen-based input devices generate handwritten documents which have on-line or dynamic (temporal) information encoded in them. Digitizing devices like Smart-Boards and computing platforms, which use pen-based input such as the IBM Thinkpad TransNote and Tablet PCs, create on-line documents. As these devices become available and affordable, large volumes of digital handwritten data will be generated and the problem of archiving and retrieving such data becomes an important concern. This thesis addresses the problem of on-line document understanding, which is an essential component of an effective retrieval algorithm. \nThis thesis describes a mathematical model for representation of on-line handwritten data based on the mechanics of the writing process. The representation is used for extracting various properties of the handwritten data, which forms the basis for understanding the higher level structure of a document. A principled approach to the problem of document segmentation is presented using a parsing technique based on stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). The parser generates a segmentation of the handwritten page, which is optimal with respect to a proposed compactness criterion. Additional properties of a region are identified based on the nature and layout of handwritten strokes in the region. An algorithm to identify ruled and unruled tables is presented. The thesis also proposes a set of features for identification of scripts within the text regions and develops an algorithm for script classification. \nThe thesis presents a matching algorithm, which computes a similarity measure between the query and handwriting samples in a database. The query and database samples could be either words or sketches, which are automatically identified by the document segmentation algorithm. We also address the related problem of document security, where on-line handwritten signatures are used to watermark on-line and off-line documents. The use of a biometric trait, such as signature, for watermarking allows the recipient of a document to verify the identity of the author in addition to document integrity."

Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

This distance transform based technique aims to remove irregular and independent unwanted clutter while preserving the text content. The novelty of this approach is in its approximation to the clutter\u2013content boundary when the clutter is attached to the content in irregular ways. As an intermediate step, a residual image is created, which forms the basis for clutter detection and removal. Clutter detection and removal are independent of clutter\u2019s position, size, shape, and connectivity with text. The method is tested on a collection of highly degraded and noisy, machine-printed and handwritten Arabic and English documents, and results show pixel-level accuracies of 99.18 and 98.67\u00a0% for clutter detection and removal, respectively. This approach is also extended to documents having a mix of clutter and salt-and-pepper noise."

The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

The GSC algorithm takes a quasi\u2010multiresolution approach to feature generation; that is, several distinct feature types are applied at different scales in the image. These computed features measure the image characteristics at local, intermediate, and large scales. The local\u2010scale features measure edge curvature in a neighborhood of a pixel, the intermediate features measure short stroke types which span several pixels, and the large features measure certain concavities which can span across the image. This philosophy, when coupled with the k\u2010nearest neighbor classification paradigm, results in a recognizer which has both high accuracy and reliable confidence behavior. The confidences computed by this algorithm are generally high for valid class objects and low for nonclass objects. This allows it to be used in document reading algorithms which search for digit or character strings embedded in a field of objects. Applications of this paradigm to off\u2010line digit string recognition and handwritten word recognition are discussed. Tests of the GSC classifier on large data bases of digits and characters are reported. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Therefore we developed a complete benchmarking environment, containing a user front-end to acquire ground truth data as well as mechanisms to evaluate the quality of the recognition results. The tasks involved in the analysis systems were the locating of table regions, identification of cells and mapping of cells to rows and columns. This paper presents our approach towards the comparison of recognition results with the ground truth. The established definitions of recall and precision did not meet our requirements, as we wanted to register even smallest improvements (or changes in general) in the results, even when both results were imperfect. We therefore extended the measures recall and precision in order to deal with recognition probabilities of objects rather than just with Boolean values."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

The model is operational and has been implemented so that it can be tested on a broad scale. The new interactions that will arise from its use may spark innovative ways of conducting document analysis research on the one hand, but create very challenging interactions with other research domains as well."
