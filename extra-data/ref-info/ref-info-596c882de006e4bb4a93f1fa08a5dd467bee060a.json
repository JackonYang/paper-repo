                "text": "Inference has been a central topic in artificial intelligence from the start, but while automatic methods for formal deduction have advanced tremendously, comparatively little progress has been made on the problem of natural language inference (NLI), that is, determining whether a natural language hypothesis h can justifiably be inferred from a natural language premise p. The challenges of NLI are quite different from those encountered in formal deduction: the emphasis is on informal reasoning, lexical semantic knowledge, and variability of linguistic expression. \nThis dissertation explores a range of approaches to NLI, beginning with methods which are robust but approximate, and proceeding to progressively more precise approaches. \nWe first develop a baseline system based on overlap between bags of words. Despite its extreme simplicity, this model achieves surprisingly good results on a standard NLI evaluation, the PASCAL RTE Challenge. However, its effectiveness is limited by its failure to represent semantic structure. \nTo remedy this lack, we next introduce the Stanford RTE system, which uses typed dependency trees as a proxy for semantic structure, and seeks a low-cost alignment between trees for p and h, using a cost model which incorporates both lexical and structural matching costs. This system is typical of a category of approaches to NLI based on approximate graph matching. We argue, however, that such methods work best when the entailment decision is based, not merely on the degree of alignment, but also on global features of the aligned \u2329p, h\u232a pair motivated by semantic theory. \nSeeking still greater precision, we devote the largest part of the dissertation to developing an approach to NLI based on a model of natural logic. We greatly extend past work in natural logic, which has focused solely on semantic containment and monotonicity, to incorporate both semantic exclusion and implicativity. Our system decomposes an inference problem into a sequence of atomic edits which transforms p into h; predicts a lexical entailment relation for each edit using a statistical classifier; propagates these relations upward through a syntax tree according to semantic properties of intermediate nodes; and composes the resulting entailment relations across the edit sequence. \nFinally, we address the problem of alignment for NLI, by developing a model of phrase-based alignment inspired by analogous work in machine translation, including an alignment scoring function, inference algorithms for finding good alignments, and training algorithms for choosing feature weights."

However, machine learning research in this area has been dramatically limited by the lack of large-scale resources. To address this, we introduce the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus, a new, freely available collection of labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based on image captioning. At 570K pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than all other resources of its type. This increase in scale allows lexicalized classifiers to outperform some sophisticated existing entailment models, and it allows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural language inference benchmarks for the first time."

                "text": "The alignment problem---establishing links between corresponding phrases in two related sentences---is as important in natural language inference (NLI) as it is in machine translation (MT). But the tools and techniques of MT alignment do not readily transfer to NLI, where one cannot assume semantic equivalence, and for which large volumes of bitext are lacking. We present a new NLI aligner, the MANLI system, designed to address these challenges. It uses a phrase-based alignment representation, exploits external lexical resources, and capitalizes on a new set of supervised training data. We compare the performance of MANLI to existing NLI and MT aligners on an NLI alignment task over the well-known Recognizing Textual Entailment data. We show that MANLI significantly outperforms existing aligners, achieving gains of 6.2% in F1 over a representative NLI aligner and 10.5% over GIZA++."

The only attempt so far to build an end-to-end differentiable neural network for entailment failed to outperform such a simple similarity classifier. In this paper, we propose a neural model that reads two sentences to determine entailment using long short-term memory units. We extend this model with a word-by-word neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of attention weights produced by this model, demonstrating such reasoning capabilities. On a large entailment dataset this model outperforms the previous best neural model and a classifier with engineered features by a substantial margin. It is the first generic end-to-end differentiable system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a textual entailment dataset."

The overall system can be viewed as comprising of three main elements: parsing, WordNet, and DIRT, built on top of a simple baseline of bag-of-words comparison. Ablation studies suggest that WordNet substantially improves the accuracy scores, while, somewhat suprisingly, parsing and DIRT only marginally improve the accuracy scores. We illustrate and discuss these results. Overall, BLUE's reasoning is sometimes insightful but sometimes nonsensical, the primary challenges being noise in the knowledge sources, lack of world knowledge, and the difficulty of accurate syntactic and semantic analysis. Despite these challenges, we argue that forming semantic representations is a necessary first step towards the larger goal of machine reading, and worthy of further exploration. Our best scores were 61.5% (2 way), 54.7% (3 way), and F=0.29 (Search Pilot)."

There have been promising developments in this sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with systems showing steady improvement, and investigations of a range of approaches to the problem. A number of researchers appear to have converged on some defining characteristics of the problem, and on characteristics of practical approaches to solving it. RTE solutions have been shown to be of practical use in other NLP applications, and other grand Natural Language Understanding (NLU) challenges, such as Learning by Reading [27] and Machine Reading [43] have emerged that will require similar problems to be solved. It is an exciting time to be working in this area. Textual Inference is a key capability for improving performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, particularly those which can benefit from integrating background knowledge. Performance of Question-Answering systems, which can be thought of as potentially the next generation of search engines, is limited, especially outside the class of factoid questions; and the task of extracting facts of interest (such as \u201cPeople who have worked for Company X\u201d) from a collection of plain text documents (such as newspaper articles) may require significant abstraction, synthesis, and application of world knowledge on the part of a human reader \u2013 and therefore"

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

However, they are usually limited in terms of accuracy and scope. Recently, the renewed prosperity of neural networks has made many improvements in a variety of NLP tasks. In our previous work, the tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) has achieved high performance in several sentence-level classification tasks. But whether TBCNN is applicable to the recognition of entailment and contradiction between two sentences remains unknown. In this paper, we propose TBCNN-pair model to recognize entailment/contradiction. Experimental results on a large dataset verify the rationale of using TBCNN as the sentencelevel model; leveraging additional heuristics like element-wise product/difference further improves the accuracy. Our model outperforms previously published results by a large margin."

In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach to abstractive sentence summarization. Our method utilizes a local attention-based model that generates each word of the summary conditioned on the input sentence. While the model is structurally simple, it can easily be trained end-to-end and scales to a large amount of training data. The model shows significant performance gains on the DUC-2004 shared task compared with several strong baselines."

The SICK data set was used in SemEval-2014 Task 1, and it freely available for research purposes."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

The method employed converts all available knowledge to a canonical template form and endeavors to create chains of non-deductive inferences from the unknowns to the possible referents. Its method of selecting among possible chains of inferences is consistent with the overall principle of \"semantic preference\" used to set up the original meaning representation, of which these anaphoric inference procedures are a manipulation."

These properties make them well suited to sequence labelling, where input sequences are transcribed with streams of labels. The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks. Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the alignment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of the long short-term memory network architecture to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences."

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."

In creating this year's dataset, a number of longer texts were introduced to make the challenge more oriented to realistic scenarios. Additionally, a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools. A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."
