Discriminable patterns can be identified for /l/, /s/, and /t/, using four locations on and under the tongue tip. A detailed study was made of these patterns in utterance final position, both singly and in cluster with each other and with a nonlingual consonant /p/. Previous results [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 34, 743 (A) (1962)] had shown that the pattern for the labiodental consonant /f/ is essentialy the same when it is alone in utterance final position, and when it is clustered with alveolar consonants. The present study permits an assessment of contextual effects on alveolar consonants when they are clustered with a nonalveolar and when they are clustered with each other.

The question investigated was: what is the difference, if any, in the acoustic and articulatory characteristics of /f/ in utterance final position and /f/ embedded in final consonant clusters. The acoustic duration of /f/ friction, measured spectographically, was about twice as great in final position as in any other position. On the other hand, electromyograms were similar for all positions of /f/. The change in /f/ friction duration from final to prefinal position is therefore a contextual effect on acoustical properties of production alone. The motor gesture is more independent of context."

Recent work has shown, for example, that a subsequent vowel has spectrographic effects on a preceding vowel\u2010consonant sequence. Furthermore, at least some of these coarticulation effects may be seen in the sequence of positions assumed by the articulators, as observed in x\u2010ray motion pictures and by articulatory position sensors. These facts, hawever, still leave open the question of the extent to which the complex gestures of speech are reorganized at the level of the muscular contractions. The present study was designed to provide information on this question by measuring the muscle\u2010contraction patterns of various consonant\u2010vowel sequences.

Overall, there is some slight average tendency for \u201ctense\u201d sounds to be produced more forcefully than \u201clax\u201d, but this tendency is present only for some subjects and when large numbers of responses are averaged. It is not large enough to serve as the basis for a phonemic distinction based on muscular effort. We conclude that the essential difference between /p/ and /b/ lies elsewhere. The present results support a conclusion drawn from other studies that the real difference is in the relative timing of events at the glottis and at the place of oral occlusion."

Muscle action potentials of the orbicularis oris muscle were recorded from three subjects. A LINC computer was used to sum and average the EMG signals of 20 tokens of 54 CVC monosyllables. The results showed that no simple correspondence exists between phonemes and motor commands. Different gestures produce /b/ and /p/ in initial and final position of an utterance. It was also shown that electromyography can be used to test linguistic hypotheses regarding particular languages. Two alternative inferences are suggested from the fact that the neural muscular correlate of a given phoneme is different in different phonetic contexts : (1) the minimal linguistic unit corresponding to the motor commands which produce speech is larger than the phoneme, perhaps more of the order of a syllable ; (2) motor commands related to phoneme production are altered, i.e. context restricted, either by feedback information concerning the existing state of muscular motion, or by stored information in the short-term memory. Further investigation is necessary before any conclusions can be reached."

The model was evaluated by consideration of high\u2010speed cinelluorograms, and electromyograms from nine articulatory locations, recorded while one subject produced 36 consonant\u2010vowel consonant monosyllables. The syllables were formed by every possible combination of initial and final consonants /b/, /d/, and /g/, and the syllable nuclei /i/, /u/, /ae/, and /\u0254/. In every possible case, some aspect of the motor control of a later syllable component was influenced by the identity of the previous one. Except in a few cases, some aspect of the motor control of an earlier syllable component was influenced by the identity of the following one. These latter influences were of greater magnitude and complexity, and more reflected in movement, in the initial consonant than in the vowel. Some of the context effects o..."

The repeated items are remembered better or worse than items in the corresponding positions of \u201call-different\u201d sequences depending on the number of times the item is repeated, the number of items repeated, the number of items intervening between the occurences of a repeated item, and the position of the repeated items in relation to the beginning and end of the sequence. In every type of repetition studied, except one, memory for the non-repeated items in sequences with repeated items is better than for the corresponding items of all-different sequences. This is true in some cases despite significant specific interference between the (non-repeated) items following the separated occurrences of repeated items. The negative effects in memory for repeated items and the positive effects in memory for non-repeated items are greater when the items are presented at the rate of five per sec. than at one per sec., contrary to the hypothesis that differential rehearsal is responsible for these effects. The results are interpreted as supporting an \u201cassociative,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cnon-associative,\u201d theory of short-term memory, as this distinction is defined in the paper."
