                "text": "1 Introduction This paper gives several new demonstrations of the usefulness of random sampling techniques in computational geometry. One new algorithm creates a search structure for arrangements of hyperplanes by sampling the hyperplanes and using information from the resulting arrangement to divide and conquer. This algorithm requires randomized O(s d+`) preprocess-ing time to build a search structure for an arrangement of s hyperplanes in d dimensions. The structure has a query time that is worst-case O(logs). (The bound holds for any fixed ~ > 0, with the constant factors dependent on d and ~.) Using point-plane du-ality, the algorithm may be used for answering halfs-pace range queries. Another algorithm finds random samples of simplices to determine the separation distance of two polytopes. The algorithm uses random-ized O(n[ d/2j) time, where n is the total number of vertices of the two polytopes. This matches previous results [DK851 for the case d : 3 and extends them. Another algorithm samples points in the plane to determine their order k Voronoi diagram, and requires randomized O(sk)o(s ~) time for s points. This sharpens the bound O(sk 2 logs) for Lee's algorithm [Lee821, and O(s 2 logs + s(s-k) log2 s) for Chazelle and Edelsbrunner's algorithm ICE851. Finally, random sampling is used to show that any set of s points in E 3 has O(sk 2 log 9 s/(log log s) 6) distinct j-sets with j < k. (For S C E d, a set S' C S with IS'} =j is a j-set of S if there is a halfspace h + with S' = S fqh+.) This sharpens with respect to k the previous bound O(sk 5) [CP851. The proof of the bound given here is an instance of a \"probabilistic method\" IES741.

If convergence holds with respect to the supremum norm $\\sup_{C \\in \\mathscr{C}}|f(C)|$, in a suitable (usually nonseparable) function space, we call $\\mathscr{C}$ a Donsker class.

Another sufficient condition is based on metric entropy with inclusion.
