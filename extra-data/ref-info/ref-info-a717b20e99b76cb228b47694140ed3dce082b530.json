The model is a joint probability distribution for the array of pixel gray levels and an array of labels. In boundary finding, the labels are binary, zero, or one, representing the absence or presence of boundary elements. In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation of these configurations.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods."
