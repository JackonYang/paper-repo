The procedure requires no input parameter and remains reliable even when features of multiple sizes are present on the digital curve. The procedure first determines the region of support for each point based on its local properties, then computes measures of relative significance (e.g. curvature) of each point, and finally detects dominant points by a process of nonmaximum suppression. This procedure leads to the observation that the performance of dominant points detection depends not only on the accuracy of the measure of significance, but also on the precise determination of the region of support. This solves the fundamental problem of scale factor selection encountered in various dominant point detection algorithms. The inherent nature of scale-space filtering in the procedure is addressed, and the performance of the procedure is compared to those of several other dominant point detection algorithms, using a number of examples. >"

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"

The input is a high resolution gray level image obtained by scanning the card image from the microfilm. Noise due to the poor quality of microfilm data and similarity in gray levels of noise patches and punches are the major problems for text extraction. Thresholding, skew correction and morphological operations are performed on the input gray level image. Card parameters such as positions of punches, etc., are calculated and used along with the knowledge about the contents of the card to separate punched holes from other artifacts. Text data are recognized by locating the punched holes and errors are corrected by a context-based approach. The algorithm has been implemented in software and tested on several images.<<ETX>>"

Extracting these primitives during the lexical analysis phase is a prerequisite to syntactic and semantic understanding of engineering drawings within the machine drawing understanding system. Bars are detected by the orthogonal zig-zag vectorization algorithm. Some of the detected bars are linear approximations of arcs. As such, they provide the basis for arc segmentation. An arc is detected by finding a chain of bars and a triplet of points along the chain. The arc center is first approximated as the center of mass of the triangle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the chords these points define. The location of the center is refined by recursively finding more such triplets and converging to within no more than a few pixels from the actual arc center after two or three iterations. The high performance of the algorithm, demonstrated on a set of real engineering drawings, is due to the fact that it avoids both raster-to-vector and massive pixel-level operations, as well as any space transformations. >"

The approach is based on the combination of schemata describing prototypical drawing constructs with a library of low-level image analysis routines and a set of explicit control rules applied by an LR(1) parser. The resulting system (Anon) integrates bottom-up and top-down processing strategies within a single, flexible framework modeled on the human perceptual cycle. Anon's structure and operation are described and discussed, and examples of its interpretation of real mechanical drawings are shown. >"

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging filter modulated by a measure of the signal discontinuity at each point. This process is related to the anisotropic diffusion reported by P. Perona and J. Malik (1987) but it has a much simpler formulation and is not subject to instability or divergence. Real examples show how this approach can be applied to the smoothing of various types of signals. The detected features do not move, and thus no tracking is needed. The last property makes it possible to derive a novel scale-space representation of a signal using a small number of scales. Finally, this process is easily implemented on parallel architectures: the running time on a 16 K connection machine is three orders of magnitude faster than on a serial machine.<<ETX>>"

Initially, Pi ODA extracts a part-of hierarchy of nested layout objects such as text-blocks, lines, and words based on their presentation on the page. Subsequently, in a step called logical labeling, the layout objects and their compositions are geometrically analyzed to identify corresponding logical objects that can be related to a human perceptible meaning, such as sender, recipient, and date in a letter. A context-sensitive text recognition for logical objects is then applied using logical vocabularies and syntactic knowledge. As a result, Pi ODA produces a document representation that conforms to the ODA international standard.<<ETX>>"

Celesstin integrates several modules in a blackboard-based interpretation system. Once a drawing has been digitized, a first processing step separates the text and the dimensioning lines from the pure graphics part. Celesstin vectorizes the graphics part and assembles the resulting lines into blocks, the basic elements for the technical entities that it creates. The result is transferred to the CAD system. Celesstin tries to match the extracted entities with the corresponding models from the CAD library. It puts the remaining blocks and lines into different layers of the CAD description. The system is based on the assumption that even when the vectorized drawing is distorted, it can be correctly interpreted by using knowledge about the representation rules used in technical drawings and about the manufacturing technology associated with the represented objects.<<ETX>>"

The system converts paper-based documents into digital form for integration into an existing database. Processing a map begins with its digitization by a scanning device. A key step in the system is the conversion from raster format to graph representation, a special binary image format suitable for processing line structures. Subsequent steps include vectorization of the line structures and recognition of the symbols interspersed in the drawing. The system requires operator interaction only to resolve ambiguities and correct errors in the automatic processes. The final result is a set of descriptors for all detected map entities, which is then stored in a database. It is shown that the image representation, vectorization techniques, and optical character recognition subsystem are quite general and that the methodology implemented in the system can be generalized to the acquisition of other classes of line drawings.<<ETX>>"

It is useful both to diminish drastically the amount of data to be handled, and to simplify the computational procedures required for description and classification purposes. Thinning a digital figure down to its skeleton is a time-consuming process when conventional sequential computers are employed. The procedure we propose allows one to speed up the thinning transformation, and to get a well-shaped skeleton. After cleaning of the input picture has been performed, the pixels of the figure are labeled according to their distance from the background, and a set, whose pixels are symmetrically placed with respect to distinct contour parts of the figure, is found. This set is then given a linear structure by applying topology preserving removal operations. Finally, a pruning step, regarding branches not relevant in the framework of the problem domain, completes the process. The resulting skeleton is a labeled set of pixels which is shown to possess all the required properties, particularly those concerning connectedness, topology, and shape. Moreover, the original figure can almost completely be recovered by means of a reverse distance transformation. Only a fixed and small number of sequential passes through the picture is necessary to achieve the goal. The computational effort is rather modest, and the use of the proposed algorithm turns out to be more advantageous the greater the width of the figure to be thinned."

Since a typical drawing contains both text strings and graphics, an algorithm has been developed to locate and separate text strings of various font sizes, styles, and orientations. This is accomplished by applying the Hough transform to the centroids of connected components in the image. The graphics in the segmented image are processed to represent thin entities by their core-lines and thick objects by their boundaries. The core-lines and boundaries are segmented into straight line segments and curved lines. The line segments and their interconnections are analyzed to locate minimum redundancy loops which are adequate to generate a succinct description of the graphics. Such a description includes the location and attributes of simple polygonal shapes, circles, and interconnecting lines, and a description of the spatial relationships and occlusions among them. Hatching and filling patterns are also identified. The performance of the system is evaluated using several test images, and the results are presented. The superiority of these algorithms in generating meaningful interpretations of graphics, compared to conventional data compression schemes, is clear from these results. >"

A number of necessary criteria are imposed on any candidate solution method. Path-based Gaussian smoothing techniques are applied to the curve to find zeros of curvature at varying levels of detail. The result is the ``generalized scale space'' image of a planar curve which is invariant under rotation, uniform scaling and translation of the curve. These properties make the scale space image suitable for matching. The matching algorithm is a modification of the uniform cost algorithm and finds the lowest cost match of contours in the scale space images. It is argued that this is preferable to matching in a so-called stable scale of the curve because no such scale may exist for a given curve. This technique is applied to register a Landsat satellite image of the Strait of Georgia, B.C. (manually corrected for skew) to a map containing the shorelines of an overlapping area."
