Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

On the other hand, local features in images have shown to be suitable representations for efficient object recognition. Therefore, it is natural to try to combine SVM approach with local features representation to gain advantages on both sides. We study in this paper the Mercer property of matching kernels which mimic classical matching algorithms used in techniques based on points of interest. We introduce a new statistical approach of kernel positiveness. We show that despite the absence of an analytical proof of the Mercer property, we can provide bounds on the probability that the Gram matrix is actually positive definite for kernels in large class of functions, under reasonable assumptions. A few experiments validate those on object recognition tasks."

In essence, a kernel is a similarity measure between input points satisfying some mathematical requirements and possibly capturing the domain knowledge. We focus on kernels for images: we represent the image information content with binary strings and discuss various bitwise manipulations obtained using logical operators and convolution with nonbinary stencils. In the theoretical contribution of our work, we show that histogram intersection is a Mercer's kernel and we determine the modifications under which a similarity measure based on the notion of Hausdorff distance is also a Mercer's kernel. In both cases, we determine explicitly the mapping from input to feature space. The presented experimental results support the relevance of our analysis for developing effective trainable systems."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classifiers such as SVM's. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically finding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identification/verification and image classification tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker verification and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM's and the generative classifiers in speaker identification and image classification."

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

Support vector machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

We derive a new positive definite kernel f(A,B) defined over pairs of matrices A,B based on the concept of principal angles between two linear subspaces. We show that the principal angles can be recovered using only inner-products between pairs of column vectors of the input matrices thereby allowing the original column vectors of A,B to be mapped onto arbitrarily high-dimensional feature spaces.We demonstrate the usage of the matrix-based kernel function f(A,B) with experiments on two visual tasks. The first task is the discrimination of \"irregular\" motion trajectory of an individual or a group of individuals in a video sequence. We use the SVM approach using f(A,B) where an input matrix represents the motion trajectory of a group of individuals over a certain (fixed) time frame. We show that the classification (irregular versus regular) greatly outperforms the conventional representation where all the trajectories form a single vector. The second application is the visual recognition of faces from input video sequences representing head motion and facial expressions where f(A,B) is used to compare two image sequences."

The family of set kernels we derive is based on a group invariant tensor product lifting with parameters that can be naturally tuned to provide a cook-book of sorts covering the possible \"wish lists\" from similarity measures over sets of varying cardinality. We highlight the strengths of our approach by demonstrating the set kernels for visual recognition of pedestrians using local parts representations."

A single image histogram, however, suffers from the inability to encode spatial image variation. An obvious way to extend this feature is to compute the histograms of multiple resolutions of an image to form a multiresolution histogram. The multiresolution histogram shares many desirable properties with the plain histogram, including that they are both fast to compute, space efficient, invariant to rigid motions, and robust to noise. In addition, the multiresolution histogram directly encodes spatial information. We describe a simple yet novel matching algorithm based on the multiresolution histogram that uses the differences between histograms of consecutive image resolutions. We evaluate it against five widely used image features. We show that with our simple feature we achieve or exceed the performance obtained with more complicated features. Further, we show our algorithm to be the most efficient and robust."

We build on an earlier hybrid generative-discriminative approach by Holub et al. [6] which extracts Fisher scores from generative models. The hybrid model allows us to combine the modelling power and flexibility of generative models with discriminative classifiers. Here we illustrate how the generative framework can be used to add prior knowledge obtained from unlabelled images, which the discriminative classifier can subsequently exploit. We illustrate the effects of using different sets of images as prior knowledge and find that the greatest benefits are incurred when the prior exemplars have similar statistics to the classes being discriminated between. Our tests show that strong performance (85%) can be obtained in discriminating between the faces of two different people using prior knowledge and only 2-3 training examples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to multi-class discrimination and show state-of-the-art performance on the Caltech101."

However due to the complexity of computing the exact minimum cost matching, previous algorithms could only run efficiently when using a limited number of features per shape, and could not scale to perform retrievals from large databases. We present a contour matching algorithm that quickly computes the minimum weight matching between sets of descriptive local features using a recently introduced low-distortion embedding of the earth mover's distance (EMD) into a normed space. Given a novel embedded contour, the nearest neighbors in a database of embedded contours are retrieved in sublinear time via approximate nearest neighbors search with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We demonstrate our shape matching method on a database of 136,500 images of human figures. Our method achieves a speedup of four orders of magnitude over the exact method, at the cost of only a 4% reduction in accuracy."

At the heart of this is the notion of an alignment between the shapes to be matched. The transformation necessary for alignment and the remaining differences after alignment are then used to make a comparison. \nA model determines what kind of deformations or alignments are acceptable, and what variation in appearance should remain after alignment. This ties strongly with the idea that the difference in shape is the residual difference, after some family of transformations has been applied for alignment. \nFinding an alignment of a model to a novel object involves search through the space of possible alignments. In many settings this search is quite difficult. This work shows that the search can be approximated by an easier discrete matching problem between key points on a model and a novel object. This is a departure from traditional approaches to deformable template matching that concentrate on analyzing differential models. This thesis presents theories and experiments on searching for, identifying, and using alignments found via discrete matchings. \nIn particular we present a mathematical and ecological motivation for a medium scale descriptor of shape, geometric blur. Geometric blur is an average over transformations of a sparse signal or feature channel, and can be computed using a spatially varying convolution. The resulting shape descriptors are useful for evaluating local shape similarity. Experiments demonstrate their efficacy for image classification and shape correspondence. \nFinding alignments between shapes is formulated as an optimization problem over discrete matchings between feature points in images. Similarity between putative correspondences is measured using geometric blur, and the deformation in the configuration of points is measured by summing over deformations in pairwise relationships. The snatching problem is formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem and approximated with a simple technique. Experimental results indicate that this generic model of local shape and deformation is applicable across a wide variety of object categories, providing good (currently the best known) performance for object recognition and localization on a difficult object recognition benchmark. \nFurthermore this generic object alignment strategy can be used to model variation in images of an object category, identifying the repeated object structures and providing automatic localization of the objects."

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications. The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further study. Equally, the book and its associated web site will guide practitioners to updated literature, new applications, and on-line software."
