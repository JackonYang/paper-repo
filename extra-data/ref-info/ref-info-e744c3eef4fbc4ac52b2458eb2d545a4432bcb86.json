The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \"face\" and \"nonface\" model clusters. At each image location, a difference feature vector is computed between the local image pattern and the distribution-based model. A trained classifier determines, based on the difference feature vector measurements, whether or not a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that the distance metric we adopt for computing difference feature vectors, and the \"nonface\" clusters we include in our distribution-based model, are both critical for the success of our system."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

We identify that the key factor in a generic and robust system is that of exploiting a large amount of evidence, related and reinforced by model knowledge through a probabilistic framework. In this paper, we propose a face detection framework that groups image features into meaningful entities-using perceptual organization, assigns probabilities to each of them, and reinforce there probabilities using Bayesian reasoning techniques. True hypotheses of faces will be reinforced to a high probability. The detection of faces under scale, orientation and viewpoint variations will be examined in a subsequent paper."

The algorithm may be robust for the assumed conditions but it becomes very difficult to extend the results to general imaging conditions. In an earlier paper (Yow and Cipolla, 1996) we proposed a feature-based face detection algorithm to detect faces in a complex background. In this paper we examine its ability to detect faces under different scale, orientation and viewpoint. The results show that the algorithm can indeed cope with a good range of scale, orientation and viewpoint variations that is typical of a subject sitting in front of a computer terminal."

We show that there is a trade-off between these two properties. An efficient solution to this trade-off is brought about by the use of different algorithms implemented in various modules, i.e. multi-modular architectures. We present a general mechanism for designing and training multi-modular architectures, integrating various neural networks into a unique pattern recognition system, which is globally trained. It is possible to realize, within the system, feature extraction and recognition in successive modules which are cooperatively trained. We discuss various rejection criteria for neural networks and multi-modular architectures. We then give two examples of such systems, study their rejection capabilities and show how to use them for segmentation. In handwritten optical character recognition, our system achieves performances at state-of-the-art level, but is eight times faster. In human face recognition, our system is intended to work in the real world."

                "text": "Many neural network classifiers provide outputs which estimate Bayesian a posteriori probabilities. When the estimation is accurate, network outputs can be treated as probabilities and sum to one. Simple proofs show that Bayesian probabilities are estimated when desired network outputs are 1 of M (one output unity, all others zero) and a squared-error or cross-entropy cost function is used. Results of Monte Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood distributions and a priori class probabilities. Interpretation of network outputs as Bayesian probabilities allows outputs from multiple networks to be combined for higher level decision making, simplifies creation of rejection thresholds, makes it possible to compensate for differences between pattern class probabilities in training and test data, allows outputs to be used to minimize alternative risk functions, and suggests alternative measures of network performance."

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
