We build upon the part-based pose-let detector, which can predict masks for numerous parts of an object. For this purpose we extend poselets to 19 other categories apart from person. We non-rigidly align these part detections to potential object contours in the image, both to increase the precision of the predicted object mask and to sort out false positives. We spatially aggregate object information via a variational smoothing technique while ensuring that object regions do not overlap. Finally, we propose to refine the segmentation based on self-similarity defined on small image patches. We obtain competitive results on the challenging Pascal VOC benchmark. On four classes we achieve the best numbers to-date."

In this paper, we propose a framework which jointly optimizes for both tasks and implicitly provides detection hypotheses and corresponding segmentations. Our novel approach is attachable to any of the available generalized Hough voting methods. We introduce Hough Regions by formulating the problem of Hough space analysis as Bayesian labeling of a random field. This exploits provided classifier responses, object center votes and low-level cues like color consistency, which are combined into a global energy term. We further propose a greedy approach to solve this energy minimization problem providing a pixel-wise assignment to background or to a specific category instance. This way we bypass the parameter sensitive non-maximum suppression that is required in related methods. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that state-of-the-art detection and segmentation results are achieved and that our method is inherently able to handle overlapping instances and an increased range of articulations, aspect ratios and scales."

This assumption makes this representation less robust to the object with occlusion [16]. In this paper, we augment the bounding box with a set of binary variables each of which corresponds to a cell indicating whether the pixels in the cell belong to the object. This segmentation-aware representation explicitly models and accounts for the supporting pixels for the object within the bounding box thus more robust to occlusion. We learn the model in a structured output framework, and develop a method that efficiently performs both inference and learning using this rich representation. The method is able to use segmentation reasoning to achieve improved detection results with richer output (cell level segmentation) on the Street Scenes and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. Finally, we present a globally coherent object model using our rich representation to account for object-object occlusion resulting in a more coherent image understanding."

However, most segmentation algorithms adopt methods which are not explicitly linked to the goal of object recognition. Here we solve a related but slightly different problem in order to assist object recognition more directly - the extraction of a foreground mask, which identifies the locations of objects in the image. We propose a novel foreground/background segmentation algorithm that attempts to segment the interesting objects from the rest of the image, while maximizing an objective function which is tightly related to object recognition. We do this in a manner which requires no class-specific knowledge of object categories, using a probabilistic formulation which is derived from manually segmented images. The model includes a geometric prior and an appearance prior, whose parameters are learnt on the fly from images that are similar to the query image. We use graph-cut based energy minimization to enforce spatial coherence on the model's output. The method is tested on the challenging VOC09 and VOC10 segmentation datasets, achieving excellent results in providing a foreground mask. We also provide comparisons to the recent segmentation method of [7]."

Learning and inference in our model are efficient as we reason at the segment level, and introduce auxiliary variables that allow us to decompose the inherent high-order potentials into pairwise potentials between a few variables with small number of states (at most the number of classes). Inference is done via a convergent message-passing algorithm, which, unlike graph-cuts inference, has no submodularity restrictions and does not require potential specific moves. We believe this is very important, as it allows us to encode our ideas and prior knowledge about the problem without the need to change the inference engine every time we introduce a new potential. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the MSRC-21 benchmark, while being much faster. Importantly, our holistic model is able to improve performance in all tasks."

The next challenge is to integrate all these algorithms and address the problem of scene understanding. This paper is a step towards this goal. We present a probabilistic framework for reasoning about regions, objects, and their attributes such as object class, location, and spatial extent. Our model is a Conditional Random Field defined on pixels, segments and objects. We define a global energy function for the model, which combines results from sliding window detectors, and low-level pixel-based unary and pairwise relations. One of our primary contributions is to show that this energy function can be solved efficiently. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvement over the baseline methods on CamVid and PASCAL VOC datasets."

This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

Both the segmentation and detection tasks are formulated as binary classification problem. A whole-object segmentor and several part detectors are learned by boosting local shape feature based weak classifiers. Given a new image, the part detectors are applied to obtain a number of part responses. All the edge pixels in the image that positively contribute to the part responses are extracted. A joint likelihood of multiple objects is defined based on the part detection responses and the object edges. Computation of the joint likelihood includes an inter-object occlusion reasoning that is based on the object silhouettes extracted with the whole-object segmentor. By maximizing the joint likelihood, part detection responses are grouped, merged, and assigned to multiple object hypotheses. The proposed approach is demonstrated with the class of pedestrians. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous ones."

We then transfer annotations from labeled images to unlabeled images using the established patch correspondences. Unlike previous approaches to non-parametric label transfer our approach does not require an initial image retrieval step. Moreover, we operate on a graph for computing mappings between images, which avoids the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Consequently, we can leverage offline computation to enhance performance at test time. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze different variants of our graph construction algorithm and evaluate multi-class pixel labeling performance on several challenging datasets."

Our Layout Consistent Random Field (LayoutCRF) model then imposes asymmetric local spatial constraints on these labels to ensure the consistent layout of parts whilst allowing for object deformation. Arbitrary occlusions of the object are handled by avoiding the assumption that the whole object is visible. The resulting system is both efficient to train and to apply to novel images, due to a novel annealed layout-consistent expansion move algorithm paired with a randomised decision tree classifier. We apply our technique to images of cars and faces and demonstrate state-of-the-art detection and segmentation performance even in the presence of partial occlusion."

We describe a Bayesian approach to human detection and segmentation combining local part-based and global template-based schemes. The approach relies on the key ideas of matching a part-template tree to images hierarchically to generate a reliable set of detection hypotheses and optimizing it under a Bayesian MAP framework through global likelihood re-evaluation and fine occlusion analysis. In addition to detection, our approach is able to obtain human shapes and poses simultaneously. We applied the approach to human detection and segmentation in crowded scenes with and without background subtraction. Experimental results show that our approach achieves good performance on images and video sequences with severe occlusion."

We decompose the test image and all images in a supervised training set into overlapping windows likely to cover foreground objects. The key idea is to transfer segmentation masks from training windows that are visually similar to windows in the test image. These transferred masks are then used to derive the unary potentials of a binary, pairwise energy function defined over the pixels of the test image, which is minimized with standard graph-cuts. This results in a fully automatic segmentation scheme, as opposed to interactive techniques based on similar energy functions. Using windows as support regions for transfer efficiently exploits the training data, as the test image does not need to be globally similar to a training image for the method to work. This enables to compose novel scenes using local parts of training images. Our approach obtains very competitive results on three datasets (PASCAL VOC 2010 segmentation challenge, Weizmann horses, Graz-02)."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

This approach requires no training, and it can easily scale to datasets with tens of thousands of images and hundreds of labels. It works by scene-level matching with global image descriptors, followed by superpixel-level matching with local features and efficient Markov random field (MRF) optimization for incorporating neighborhood context. Our MRF setup can also compute a simultaneous labeling of image regions into semantic classes (e.g., tree, building, car) and geometric classes (sky, vertical, ground). Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art non-parametric method based on SIFT Flow on a dataset of 2,688 images and 33 labels. In addition, we report per-pixel rates on a larger dataset of 15,150 images and 170 labels. To our knowledge, this is the first complete evaluation of image parsing on a dataset of this size, and it establishes a new benchmark for the problem."

The system combines region-level features with per-exemplar sliding window detectors. Per-exemplar detectors are better suited for our parsing task than traditional bounding box detectors: they perform well on classes with little training data and high intra-class variation, and they allow object masks to be transferred into the test image for pixel-level segmentation. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three challenging datasets, the largest of which contains 45,676 images and 232 labels."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

This contrasts the classical cosegmentation problem dealt with by most existing algorithms, which assume a much simpler but less realistic setting where the same set of foregrounds recurs in every image. We propose a novel optimization method for MFC, which makes no assumption on foreground configurations and does not suffer from the aforementioned limitation, while still leverages all the benefits of having co-occurring or (partially) recurring contents across images. Our method builds on an iterative scheme that alternates between a foreground modeling module and a region assignment module, both highly efficient and scalable. In particular, our approach is flexible enough to integrate any advanced region classifiers for foreground modeling, and our region assignment employs a combinatorial auction framework that enjoys several intuitively good properties such as optimality guarantee and linear complexity. We show the superior performance of our method in both segmentation quality and scalability in comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques on a newly introduced FlickrMFC dataset and the standard ImageNet dataset."

In particular, handling cases of partial visibility where some limbs may be occluded or one person is partially occluding another. Two standard, but disparate, approaches have developed in the field: the first is the part based approach for layout type problems, involving optimising an articulated pictorial structure, the second is the pixel based approach for image labelling involving optimising a random field graph defined on the image. Our novel contribution is a formulation for pose estimation which combines these two models in a principled way in one optimisation problem and thereby inherits the advantages of both of them. Inference on this joint model finds the set of instances of persons in an image, the location of their joints, and a pixel-wise body part labelling. We achieve near or state of the art results on standard human pose data sets, and demonstrate the correct estimation for cases of self-occlusion, person overlap and image truncation."

A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting features and estimating per-feature parameters."

The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding."

Such postprocessing requires the tuning of many parameters and is often fragile, especially when objects are located spatially close to each other. In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic framework for object detection which is related to the Hough transform. It shares the simplicity and wide applicability of the Hough transform but, at the same time, bypasses the problem of multiple peak identification in Hough images and permits detection of multiple objects without invoking nonmaximum suppression heuristics. Our experiments demonstrate that this method results in a significant improvement in detection accuracy both for the classical task of straight line detection and for a more modern category-level (pedestrian) detection problem."

A promising graph cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs known as \"roof duality\" was recently introduced into computer vision. We study two methods which extend this approach. First, we discuss an efficient implementation of the \"probing\" technique introduced recently by Bows et al. (2006). It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of the work of Bows et al. (2006). Second, we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach. In comparison to existing techniques, such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and simulated annealing, we nearly always find a lower energy."

While often a critical cue at the category-level, contour matches can be difficult to isolate reliably from edge clutter-even within labeled images from a known class, let alone unlabeled examples. We propose a shape discovery method in which local appearance (patch) matches serve to anchor the surrounding edge fragments, yielding a more reliable affinity function for images that accounts for both shape and appearance. Spectral clustering from the initial affinities provides candidate object clusters. Then, we compute the within-cluster match patterns to discern foreground edges from clutter, attributing higher weight to edges more likely to belong to a common object. In addition to discovering the object contours in each image, we show how to summarize what is found with prototypical shapes. Our results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the approach can successfully discover shapes from unlabeled images."

However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use \u2013 a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels \u2013 and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very practical. Experiments show that our approach produces superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a segmentation quality equal to or greater than four state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already been shown to increase performance over pixel-based methods."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

A novel and efficient nearest neighbor matching scheme, the ANN bilateral matching scheme, is proposed. Based on the proposed matching scheme, we first retrieve some partially similar images for each given test image from the training image database. The test image can be well explained by these retrieved images, with similar regions existing in the retrieved images for each region in the test image. Then, we match the test image to the retrieved training images with the ANN bilateral matching scheme, and parse the test image by integrating multiple cues in a markov random field. Experiment on three datasets shows our method achieved promising parsing accuracy and outperformed two state-of-the-art nonparametric image parsing methods."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

This paper generalizes PatchMatch in three ways: (1) to find k nearest neighbors, as opposed to just one, (2) to search across scales and rotations, in addition to just translations, and (3) to match using arbitrary descriptors and distances, not just sum-of-squared-differences on patch colors. In addition, we offer new search and parallelization strategies that further accelerate the method, and we show performance improvements over standard kd-tree techniques across a variety of inputs. In contrast to many previous matching algorithms, which for efficiency reasons have restricted matching to sparse interest points, or spatially proximate matches, our algorithm can efficiently find global, dense matches, even while matching across all scales and rotations. This is especially useful for computer vision applications, where our algorithm can be used as an efficient general-purpose component. We explore a variety of vision applications: denoising, finding forgeries by detecting cloned regions, symmetry detection, and object detection."
