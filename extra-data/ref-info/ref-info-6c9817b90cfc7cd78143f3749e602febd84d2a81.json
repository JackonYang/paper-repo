Recently a number of algorithms have been developed that successfully perform motion segmentation by assuming that the motion of each group can be described by a low dimensional parametric model (e.g. affine). Typically the assumption is that motion segments correspond to planar patches in 3D undergoing rigid motion. Here we develop an alternative approach, where the motion of each group is described by a smooth dense flow field and the stability of the estimation is ensured by means of a prior distribution on the class of flow fields. We present a variant of the EM algorithm that can segment image sequences by fitting multiple smooth flow fields to the spatiotemporal data. Using the method of Green's functions, we show how the estimation of a single smooth flow field can be performed in closed form, thus making the multiple model estimation computationally feasible. Furthermore, the number of models is estimated automatically using similar methods to those used in the parametric approach. We illustrate the algorithm's performance on synthetic and real image sequences."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

The image restoration problem is considered in a Bayesian setting. We assume as prior distribution multicolour Markov random fields on a graph whose main restriction is the presence of only pairwise site interactions. The noise is modelled as a Bernoulli field. Computing the mode of the posterior distribution is NP complete, i.e. can (very likely) be done only in a time exponential in the number of sites of the underlying graph. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time and is based on the coding of the colours. It produces an image with the following property: either a pixel is coloured with one of the possible colours or it is left blank. In the first case we prove that this is the colour of the site in the exact MAP restoration. The quality of the approximation is then measured by the number of sites being left blank. We assess the performance of the new algorithm by numerical experiments on the simple three-colour Potts model. More rigorously, we present a probabilistic analysis of the algorithm. The results indicate that the approximation is quite often sufficiently good for the interpretation of the image."

The three main issues in a junction (or any feature) detector are: scale, location, and, the junction (feature) parameters. The junction parameters are (1) the radius, or size, of the junction, (2) the kind of junction: lines, corners, 3-junctions such as T or Y, or, 4-junction such as X-junction, etcetera, (3) angles of the wedges, and, (4) intensity in each of the wedges. Our main contribution in this paper is a modeling of the junction (using the minimum description length principle), which is complex enough to handle all the three issues and simple enough to admit an effective dynamic programming solution. Kona is an implementation of this model. A similar approach can be used to model other features like thick edges, blobs and end-points."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This model can be applied to smooth a field preserving its discontinuities. A class of more complex models is then proposed in order to deal with a variety of vision problems. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of statistical mechanics and mean field techniques.

We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
