In contrast to the well known back-off n-gram language models, the neural network approach attempts to overcome the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space. This type of language model was mostly used for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available.In this paper we present new algorithms to train a neural network language model on very large text corpora. This makes possible the use of the approach in domains where several hundreds of millions words of texts are available. The neural network language model is evaluated in a state-of-the-art real-time continuous speech recognizer for French Broadcast News. Word error reductions of 0.5% absolute are reported using only a very limited amount of additional processing time."

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

However, training the neural network model with the maximum-likelihood criterion requires computations proportional to the number of words in the vocabulary. In this paper, we introduce adaptive importance sampling as a way to accelerate training of the model. The idea is to use an adaptive n-gram model to track the conditional distributions produced by the neural network. We show that a very significant speedup can be obtained on standard problems."

Unlike traditional discriminative training methods that require transcribed speech, only untranscribed speech and a large text corpus is required. An exponential form is assumed for the language model, as done in maximum entropy estimation, but the model is trained from the text using a discriminative criterion that targets word confusions actually witnessed in first-pass ASR output lattices. Specifically, model parameters are estimated to maximize the likelihood ratio between words w in the text corpus and w's cohorts in the test speech, i.e. other words that w competes with in the test lattices. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate statistically significant improvements over a 4-gram language model on a large vocabulary ASR task."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

The system was designed for participation in the speech to text part of the evaluations, in particular for transcription of speech recorded with multiple distant microphones and independent headset microphones. System performance was tested on both conference room and lecture style meetings. Although input sources are processed using different front-ends, the recognition process is based on a unified system architecture. The system operates in multiple passes and makes use of state of the art technologies such as discriminative training, vocal tract length normalisation, heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis, speaker adaptation with maximum likelihood linear regression and minimum word error rate decoding. In this paper we describe the system performance on the official development and test sets for the NIST RT05s evaluations. The system was jointly developed in less than 10 months by a multi-site team and was shown to achieve competitive performance."

While all of these techniques have been studied separately, they have rarely been studied in combination. We compare a combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model with no count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38 and 50% (1 bit of entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate reduction of 8.9%.

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

                "text": "It is shown that optimal text compression is a harder problem than artificial intelligence as defined by Turing\u2019s (1950) imitation game; thus compression ratio on a standard benchmark corpus could be used as an objective and quantitative alternative test for AI (Mahoney, 1999). Specifically, let L, M, and J be the probability distributions of responses chosen by a human, machine, and human judge respectively to the judge\u2019s questions in the imitation game. The goal of AI is M = L, the machine is indistinguishable from human. But the machine wins (the judge guesses that it is human) when HJ(M) < HJ(L), where HQ(P) \u2261 \u2212\u03a3x P(x) log Q(x) is the cross entropy of Q with respect to P. This happens when J is a poor estimate of L, meaning that the interrogator fails to anticipate the human\u2019s responses, but even in the worst case when J = L, the machine can still win with a suboptimal solution (M \u2260 L) by deterministically favoring the most likely responses over the true distribution. In contrast, optimal compression of a probabilistic language L with unknown distribution (such as English) using an estimated distribution M (an encoding of length \u2212log2 M(x) bits for each string x) is M = L, by the discrete channel capacity theorem (Shannon, 1949). Answering questions in the Turing test (What are roses?) seems to require the same type of real-world knowledge that people use in predicting characters in a stream of natural language text (Roses are ___?), or equivalently, estimating L(x) for compression. Shannon (1951), and Cover and King (1978) established an upper bound of 1.3 bits per character (bpc) for the entropy (information content) of English narrative in a 27character alphabet (A-Z and space) using human prediction tests. No compression program has achieved this. Seven programs, including those top-rated by Gilchrist (1998) and Bell (1998) were used to compress English narrative, Alice in Wonderland (alice30.txt from the Gutenberg press, minus header) and Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy (book1 from the Calgary corpus), after reducing both to 27 characters. The best compression was achieved by rkive 1.91b1: 1.86 bpc on alice and 1.94 on book1. Others tested (from worst to best) were compress 4.3d, pkzip 2.04e, gzip 1.2.4, ha 0.98, szip 1.05x, and boa 0.58b. All program options were set for maximum compression. Better compressors \u201clearn\u201d, using prior input to improve compression on subsequent input. szip was the best learner, compressing book1 to about 95% of the size of the two halves compressed separately. The first figure below shows the correlation between compression and learning. Similar results were obtained for alice. It was also found that better compressors make greater use of the syntactic and semantic constraints of English. Lexical,"

We discuss challenges such a design faces and describe our solutions that scale well to large tagsets and corpora. We advocate the use of relatively simple tags that do not require deep linguistic knowledge of the language but provide more structural information than POS tags and can be derived from automatically generated parse trees - a combination of properties that allows easy adoption of this model for new languages. We propose two fine-grain tagsets and evaluate our model using these tags, as well as POS tags and SuperARV tags in a speech recognition task and discuss future directions."
