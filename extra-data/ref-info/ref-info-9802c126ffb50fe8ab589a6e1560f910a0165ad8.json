Recognizing these objects facilitates the recognition of document classes. Some promising results have been achieved by using autoassociator-based artificial neural networks (AANN) in the presence of homogeneously distributed noise. However, the performance drops significantly when dealing with spot-noisy logos, where strips or blobs produce a partial obstruction of the pictures. We propose a new approach for training AANNs especially conceived for dealing with spot noise. The basic idea is to introduce new metrics for assessing the reproduction error in AANNs. The proposed algorithm, referred to as spot-backpropagation (S-BP), is significantly more robust with respect to spot-noise than classical Euclidean norm-based backpropagation (BP). Our experimental results are based on a database of 88 real logos that are artificially corrupted by spot-noise."

In fact, feature-based approaches usually fail to give satisfactory solutions because of the sensitivity of the approach to the a priori selection of the features, and the incapacity to represent any specific information on the relationships among the components of the structures. However, we show that neural networks can, in fact, represent and classify structured patterns. The key idea underpinning our approach is the use of the so called \"generalized recursive neuron\", which is essentially a generalization to structures of a recurrent neuron. By using generalized recursive neurons, all the supervised networks developed for the classification of sequences, such as backpropagation through time networks, real-time recurrent networks, simple recurrent networks, recurrent cascade correlation networks, and neural trees can, on the whole, be generalized to structures. The results obtained by some of the above networks (with generalized recursive neurons) on the classification of logic terms are presented."

                "text": "The problem of logo recognition is of great interest in the document domain, especially for databases, because of its potential for identifying the source of the document and its generality as a recognition problem. By recognizing the logo, one obtains semantic information about the document, which may be useful in deciding whether or not to analyze the textual components. A multi-level stages approach to logo recognition which uses global invariants to prune the database and local affine invariants to obtain a more refined match is presented. An invariant signature which can be used for matching under a variety of transformations is obtained. The authors provide a method of computing Euclidean invariants and show how to extend them to capture similarity, affine, and projective invariants when necessary. They implement feature detection, feature extraction, and local invariant algorithms and successfully demonstrate the approach on a small database.<<ETX>>"

The method is incorporated into an image database system for African ethnological patterns which consist of lines, arcs, solid areas and hatched areas. Patterns are first separated into two sub-patterns, i.e. a solid sub-pattern and an elongated sub-pattern. The elongated sub-pattern is first broken down into small fragments, which are then connected to be integrated into more global features, i.e. line segments and circular arc segments, by bottom-up stepwise strategy. Hatched areas made of parallel lines are detected by using a clustering technique. The method worked well and the result of processing may be used for making description of patterns.<<ETX>>"

Establishing the essential properties of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases."
