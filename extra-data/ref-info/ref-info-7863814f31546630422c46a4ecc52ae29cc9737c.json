As it is shown in this paper, by using adequate techniques to cope with these two issues, the NN-based classification leads to better results than those obtained by other approaches that have been applied to a task of human banded chromosomes classification."

FVC2000 competition attempted to establish the first common benchmark, allowing companies and academic institutions to unambiguously compare performance and track improvements in their fingerprint recognition algorithms. Three databases were created using different state-of-the-art sensors and a fourth database was artificially generated; 11 algorithms were extensively tested on the four data sets. We believe that FVC2000 protocol, databases, and results will be useful to all practitioners in the field not only as a benchmark for improving methods, but also for enabling an unbiased evaluation of algorithms."

This paradigm is driven by the exploitation of networking technology and the need to be able to create more powerful capabilities more quickly. The diversity in languages, middleware, and platforms has prevented larger constructs from being formed and the shortage of qualified software engineers only aggravates the problem. The inception of the Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) paradigm is being defined throughout the industry including: Sun\u2019s JiniTM, OpenwingsTM, Microsoft\u2019s. NETTM, and HP\u2019s CoolTownTM. Much like the early days of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), certain characteristics of SOP are covered by some implementations, but no one approach covers all of them. Until the key features of OOP (encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism) and a design methodology (OOA/OOD) had been defined, consistency in OOP programming models was not achieved. This paper analyzes Service-Oriented technologies to identify the key characteristics and patterns of SOP, and demonstrates the value of SOP to developers and end users."
