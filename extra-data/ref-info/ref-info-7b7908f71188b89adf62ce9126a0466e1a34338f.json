A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index."

This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

This paper presents a simple but effective coding scheme called Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) in place of the VQ coding in traditional SPM. LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications."

Informally, the quantized representation retains as much information as possible for classifying the feature vector correctly. We derive an alternating minimization procedure for simultaneously learning codebooks in the Euclidean feature space and in the simplex of posterior class distributions. The resulting quantizer can be used to encode unlabeled points outside the training set and to predict their posterior class distributions, and has an elegant interpretation in terms of lossless source coding. The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real data sets and is applied to two diverse problems: learning discriminative visual vocabularies for bag-of-features image classification and image segmentation."

The supervised dictionary training is performed via back-projection, by minimizing the training error of classifying the image level features, which are extracted by max pooling over the sparse codes within a spatial pyramid. Such a max pooling procedure across multiple spatial scales offer the model translation invariant properties, similar to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments show that our supervised dictionary improves the performance of the proposed model significantly over the unsupervised dictionary, leading to state-of-the-art performance on diverse image databases. Further more, our supervised model targets learning linear features, implying its great potential in handling large scale datasets in real applications."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

The pipeline first performs a non-linear feature transformation on descriptors, then aggregates the results together to form image-level representations, and finally applies a classification model. For all the three steps we suggest novel solutions which make our approach appealing in theory, more scalable in computation, and transparent in classification. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed classification method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the well-known PASCAL benchmarks."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

The codebook approach describes an image as a bag of discrete visual codewords, where the frequency distributions of these words are used for image categorization. There are two drawbacks to the traditional codebook model: codeword uncertainty and codeword plausibility. Both of these drawbacks stem from the hard assignment of visual features to a single codeword. We show that allowing a degree of ambiguity in assigning codewords improves categorization performance for three state-of-the-art datasets."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

There are no known exact algorithms for solving these high-dimensional problems that are faster than linear search.

In this paper, we describe a system that answers the question, \u201cWhat is the fastest approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm for my data?\u201d Our system will take any given dataset and desired degree of precision and use these to automatically determine the best algorithm and parameter values. We also describe a new algorithm that applies priority search on hierarchical k-means trees, which we have found to provide the best known performance on many datasets. After testing a range of alternatives, we have found that multiple randomized k-d trees provide the best performance for other datasets. We are releasing public domain code that implements these approaches. This library provides about one order of magnitude improvement in query time over the best previously available software and provides fully automated parameter selection."

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods."

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \\cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes."

These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number of features N, while each example has only s << N non-zero features. This paper presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets."

The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date account of the theory and methodological developments underlying the applications of finite mixture models. Because of their flexibility, mixture models are being increasingly exploited as a convenient, semiparametric way in which to model unknown distributional shapes. This is in addition to their obvious applications where there is group-structure in the data or where the aim is to explore the data for such structure, as in a cluster analysis. It has now been three decades since the publication of the monograph by McLachlan & Basford (1988) with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of mixture models for inference and clustering. Since then, mixture models have attracted the interest of many researchers and have found many new and interesting fields of application. Thus, the literature on mixture models has expanded enormously, and as a consequence, the bibliography here can only provide selected coverage."

The linear SVMs are in general much faster to learn and evaluate (test) than the original nonlinear SVMs. This work introduces explicit feature maps for the additive class of kernels, such as the intersection, Hellinger's, and \u03c72 kernels, commonly used in computer vision, and enables their use in large scale problems. In particular, we: 1) provide explicit feature maps for all additive homogeneous kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; 2) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on a spectral analysis; and 3) quantify the error of the approximation, showing that the error is independent of the data dimension and decays exponentially fast with the approximation order for selected kernels such as \u03c72. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernels yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVMs. We also compare with two other approximation methods: Nystrom's approximation of Perronnin et al., which is data dependent, and the explicit map of Maji and Berg for the intersection kernel, which, as in the case of our approximations, is data independent. The approximations are evaluated on a number of standard data sets, including Caltech-101, Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians, and INRIA pedestrians."
