It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints. Results are presented on several sets of real images."

Our texture model is based on the statistical distribution of clustered filter responses. However, unlike previous 3D texton representations, we use rotationally invariant filters and cluster in an extremely low dimensional space. Having built a texton dictionary, we present a novel method of classifying a single image without requiring any a priori knowledge about the viewing or illumination conditions under which it was photographed. We argue that using rotationally invariant filters while clustering in such a low dimensional space improves classification performance and demonstrate this claim with results on all 61 textures in the Columbia-Utrecht database. We then proceed to show how texture models can be further extended by compensating for viewpoint changes using weak isotropy.The new clustering and classification methods are compared to those of Leung and Malik (ICCV 1999), Schmid (CVPR 2001) and Cula and Dana (CVPR 2001), which are the current state-of-the-art approaches."

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of \"generic\" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the \"generic\" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of \"spatial-frequency\" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture \"texture-like\" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for \"textured\" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization."

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as \"periodicity,\" \"directionality,\" and \"randomness,\" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented."

This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping."

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

The topology is restricted to resolutions up to the extent of the local region of interest (ROI). Although the ROI's may contain many pixels, there is no spatial order on the pixels within the ROI, the only information preserved is the histogram of pixel values within the ROI's. This can be considered as an extreme case of a textel (texture element) image: The histogram is the limit of texture where the spatial order has been completely disregarded. We argue that locally orderless images are ubiquitous in perception and the visual arts. Formally, the orderless images are most aptly described by three mutually intertwined scale spaces. The scale parameters correspond to the pixellation (\u201cinner scale\u201d), the extent of the ROI's (\u201couter scale\u201d) and the resolution in the histogram (\u201ctonal scale\u201d). We describe how to construct locally orderless images, how to render them, and how to use them in a variety of local and global image processing operations."

We present a compression scheme for spin images that results in efficient multiple object recognition which we verify with results showing the simultaneous recognition of multiple objects from a library of 20 models.

This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching. When used to compare distributions that have the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."
