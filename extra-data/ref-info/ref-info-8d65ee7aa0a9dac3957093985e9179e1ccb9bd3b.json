A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a new discriminative sequence modeling technique that supports the incorporation of many rich features. This paper demonstrates the ability of CRFs to easily integrate domain knowledge, and thus reduce the need for labeled data. Using readily-available domain knowledge in the CRF\u2019s feature definitions we show that, even training on as few as 140 segmented Chinese sentences, we can achieve world-class segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, when training on more data, our approach yields segmentation F1 of 97.5% with the Penn Chinese Treebank, and realistic, incomplete lexicons\u2014a 50% reduction in error compared with the previously best published results of which we are aware. We also introduce two alternative prior distributions for CRF\u2019s learned weights."

Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing, shallow parsing has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and extensive comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to achieve performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on the CoNLL task, and better than any reported single model. Improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results. We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy models."

By working v,ithin the framework of maximum entropy theory and utilizing a flexible object-based architecture, the system is able to make use of an extraordinarily diverse range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. These knowledge sources include capitalization features, lexical features, features indicating the current section of text (i.e. headline or main body), and dictionaries of single or multi-word terms. The purely statistical system contains no hand-generated patterns and achieves a result comparable with the best statistical systems. However, when combined with other handcoded systems, the system achieves scores that exceed the highest comparable scores thus-far published. 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N Named entity recognition is one of the simplest of the common message understanding tasks. The objective is to identify and categorize all members of certain categories of \"proper names\" from a given corpus. The specific test bed which will be the subject of this paper is that of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7), in which the task was to identify \"names\" falling into one of seven categories: person, organization, location, date, time, percentage, and monetary amount. This paper describes a new system called \"Maximum Entropy Named Entity\" or \"MENE\" (pronounced \"meanie\"). By working within the framework of maximum entropy theory and utilizing a flexible object-based architecture, the system is able to make use of an extraordinarily diverse range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decision. These knowledge sources include capitalization features, lexical features, and features indicating the current section of text. It makes use of a broad array of dictionaries of useful single or multi-word terms such as first names, company names, and corporate suffixes, and automatically handles cases where words are in more than one dictionary. Our dictio152 naries required no manual editing and were either downloaded from the web or were simply \"obvious\" lists entered by hand. This system, built from off-the-shelf knowledge sources, contained no hand-generated pat terns and achieved a result which is comparable with that of the best statistical systems. Further experiments showed that when combined with handcoded systems from NYU, the University of Manitoba, and IsoQuest, Inc., MENE was able to generate scores which exceeded the highest scores thus-far reported by any system on a MUC evaluation. Given appropriate training data, we believe that this system is highly portable to other domains and languages and have already achieved good results on upper-case English. We also feel that there are plenty of avenues to explore in enhancing the system's performance on English-language newspaper"

A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom, however, an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents an efficient feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle of iteratively constructing feature conjunctions that would significantly increase conditional log-likelihood if added to the model. Automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it corresponds to learning clique templates, and can also be understood as supervised structure learning. Experimental results on named entity extraction and noun phrase segmentation tasks are presented."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states.

This paper presents bootstrapping as an alternative approach to learning from large sets of labeled data. Instead of a large quantity of labeled data, this paper advocates using a small amount of seed information and a large collection of easily-obtained unlabeled data. Bootstrapping initializes a learner with the seed information; it then iterates, applying the learner to calculate labels for the unlabeled data, and incorporating some of these labels into the training input for the learner. Two case studies of this approach are presented. Bootstrapping for information extraction provides 76% precision for a 250-word dictionary for extracting locations from web pages, when starting with just a few seed locations. Bootstrapping a text classifier from a few keywords per class and a class hierarchy provides accuracy of 66%, a level close to human agreement, when placing computer science research papers into a topic hierarchy. The success of these two examples argues for the strength of the general bootstrapping approach for text learning tasks."

The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given.

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices."
