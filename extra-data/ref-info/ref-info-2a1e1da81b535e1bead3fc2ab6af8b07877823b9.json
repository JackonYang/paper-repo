For interpolation problems this prior knowledge frequently includes smoothness requirements on the network mapping, and can be imposed by the addition to the error function of suitable regularization terms. The new error function, however, now depends on the derivatives of the network mapping, and so the standard backpropagation algorithm cannot be applied. In this letter, we derive a computationally efficient learning algorithm, for a feedforward network of arbitrary topology, which can be used to minimize such error functions. Networks having a single hidden layer, for which the learning algorithm simplifies, are treated as a special case."

This form of error measure can lead to the problem of over-fitting in which the network stores individual data points from the training set, but fails to generalize satisfactorily for new data points. In the present work, the author proposes a modified error measure which can reduce the tendency to over-fit and whose properties can be controlled by a single scalar parameter. The proposed error measure depends both on the function generated by the network and on its derivatives. A novel learning algorithm was derived which can be used to minimize such error measures.<<ETX>>"

First, it is argued that the output of a classifier should be obtained by marginalizing over the posterior distribution of the parameters; a simple approximation to this integral is proposed and demonstrated. This involves a \"moderation\" of the most probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models in MacKay (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework."

This example regards the localization of primary word stress. The knowledge of the position of primary stress is very useful in text-to-speech synthesis of Italian, a language characterized by a very prominent word accent. In fact, the position of word stress is the basis for the automatic generation of the pattern of duration of the syllables and of the intonation of the whole phrase. The authors use a feedforward network with an error backpropagation learning, extending the method with the computation of the correction step based on the second derivative of the error function. This method has been used to speed up convergence without using a fixed learning rate and a momentum term. The authors obtain a steep decrease of the error at the expense of a limited increase of the computational cost.<<ETX>>"
