In order to study the systems without the influence of the language model, an isolated word recognition task has been performed. The analysis of the influence of word lengths on the error rates of the recognizers has lead to combine those classifiers with another one specialized in short words. To this end, various multilayer perceptrons have been trained to classify a subset of the vocabulary in a holistic manner. Combining the classifiers by means of a variation of the Borda count voting method achieves very satisfying results."

Applying SegRec principle, the recognizer does not make hard decision at the character segmentation process. Instead, it delays the character segmentation to the recognition stage by generating a segmentation graph that describes all possible ways to segment a word into letters. To recognize a word, the NN computes the observation probabilities for each segmentation candidates (SCs) in the segmentation graph. Then, using concatenated letter-HMMs, a likelihood is computed for each word in the lexicon by multiplying the probabilities over the best paths through the graph. We present in detail two approaches to train the word recognizer: 1.) character-level training 2.) word-level training. The recognition performances of the two systems are discussed."

                "text": "Online handwritten word recognition systems usually rely on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are effective under many circumstances, but suffer some major limitations in real world applications. Artificial neural networks (ANN) appear to be a promising alternative, however they failed to model sequence data such as online handwriting due to their variable lengths. As a consequence, by combining HMMs and ANN, we can expect to take advantage of the robustness and flexibility of the HMMs generative models and of the discriminative power of the ANN. Training such a hybrid system is not straightforward, this is why so few attempts are encountered in literature. We compare several different training schemes: maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum mutual information (MMI) criteria in the framework of online handwriting recognition with a global optimization approach defined at the word level. A new generic criterion mixing generative model and discriminant trainings is proposed, it allows to train a multistate TDNN-HMM system directly at the word level. This architecture is based on an analytical approach with an implicit segmentation. To control the implicit segmentation and to initialize correctly the system without bootstrapping with another recognition system, we have defined a process that constraints the segmentation path and a measure called Average Segmentation Rate (ASR). Recognition experiments on the online IRONOFF database demonstrated the interest of the generic training criterion and the control of the implicit segmentation."

The only assumption made about the data is that it is written in English. This allows the application of statistical language models in order to improve the performance of our system. Several experiments have been performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from 10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent for multiple writer data). Our approach is described in detail and compared with other methods presented in the literature to deal with the same problem. An experimental setup to correctly deal with unconstrained text recognition is proposed."

After preprocessing, a word image is segmented into letters or pseudoletters and represented by two feature sequences of equal length, each consisting of an alternating sequence of shape-symbols and segmentation-symbols, which are both explicitly modeled. The word model is made up of the concatenation of appropriate letter models consisting of elementary HMMs and an HMM-based interpolation technique is used to optimally combine the two feature sets. Two rejection mechanisms are considered depending on whether or not the word image is guaranteed to belong to the lexicon. Experiments carried out on real-life data show that the proposed approach can be successfully used for handwritten word recognition."

The input data is processed first by a lexicon-driven word recognizer based on HMMs to generate a list of the candidate N-best-scoring word hypotheses as well as the segmentation of such word hypotheses into characters. An NN classifier is used to generate a score for each segmented character and in the end, the scores from the HMM and the NN classifiers are combined to optimize performance. Experimental results show that for an 80,000-word vocabulary, the hybrid HMM/NN system improves by about 10% the word recognition rate over the HMM system alone."

We present here some new results concerning a hybrid on-line handwriting recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Neural Networks (NNs), which has already been presented in several contributions. In our approach, a letter-model is a Left-Right HMM, whose emission probability densities are approximated with mixtures of predictive multilayer perceptrons. The basic letter models are cascaded in order to build models for words and sentences. At the word level, recognition is performed thanks to a dictionary organized with a tree-structure. At the sentence level, a word-predecessor conditioned frame synchronous beam search algorithm allows to perform simultaneously segmentation into words and word recognition. It processes through the building of a word graph from which a set of candidate sentences may be extracted. Word and sentence recognition performances are evaluated on parts of the UNIPEN international database."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

While Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is a dominant approach in most state-of-the-art speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition systems (and commercial products), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are universally known as one the most powerful nonlinear methods for pattern recognition, time series prediction, optimization and forecasting. Hybrid HMM/ANN, introduced in the nineties for speech recognition, is presently a very competitive alternative to HMM, both in terms of performances and recognition accuracy. HMM/ANN combines the advantages of both approaches by using an ANN (a multilayer perceptron) to estimate the state dependent observation probabilities of a HMM, instead of Gaussian mixtures, while the temporal aspects of speech are dealt with by left-to-right HMM models. HMM/ANN can provide discriminative training, are capable of incorporating multiple input sources, and have a flexible architecture which can easily accommodate contextual inputs and feedbacks. Furthermore, ANN are typically highly parallel and regular structures, which makes them especially suited for high-performance architectures and optimized implementations."

Most efforts have been devoted to the recognition of isolated handwritten and printed characters with widely recognized successful results. However, many other document processing tasks, like preprocessing, layout analysis, character segmentation, word recognition, and signature verification, have been effectively faced with very promising results. This paper surveys the most significant problems in the area of offline document image processing, where connectionist-based approaches have been applied. Similarities and differences between approaches belonging to different categories are discussed. A particular emphasis is given on the crucial role of prior knowledge for the conception of both appropriate architectures and learning algorithms. Finally, the paper provides a critical analysts on the reviewed approaches and depicts the most promising research guidelines in the field. In particular, a second generation of connectionist-based models are foreseen which are based on appropriate graphical representations of the learning environment."

We describe the application of this method to two problems: recognition of handwritten ZIP Codes, and recognition of handwritten words. For the ZIP Codes, we also used the method to automatically segment the images during training: the dynamic programming stage both performs the segmentation and provides inputs and desired outputs to the neural network. Results are reported for a test set of 2642 unsegmented handwritten 212 dpi binary ZIP Code (5- and 9-digit) images. For handwritten word recognition, we combined SPS with a \u201cSpace Displacement Neural Network\u201d approach, in which a single-character-recognition network is extended over the entire word image, and in which SPS techniques are then used to rank order a given lexicon. We report results on a test set of 3000 300 ppi gray scale word images, extracted from images of live mail pieces, for lexicons of size 10, 100, and 1000. Representing the problem as a graph as proposed in this paper has advantages beyond the efficient finding of the final optimal segmentation, or the automatic segmentation of images during training. We can also easily extend the technique to generate K \u201crunner up\u201d answers (for example, by finding the K shortest paths). This paper will also describe applications of some of these ideas."

We adopt an explicit segmentation-based word level architecture to implement an HMM classifier. An efficient state transition model and a parameter re-estimation scheme are introduced to use non-scaled and non-normalised symbol vectors without having to label primitive vectors. This approach brings well-formed discrete signals for the variable state duration of the HMM. We also introduce a new probability measure as well as conventional schemes to combine the proposed HMMs and a general MLP. The main contributions of this model are a novel design of the segmentation-based variable length HMMs, and an efficient method of combining two distinct classifiers. Experiments have been conducted using the legal word database of CENPARMI with encouraging results."

Conventional approaches follow a serial, first-recognition then-interpretation scheme which cannot adequately use semantic\u2013pragmatic knowledge to recover from recognition errors. Stochastic finite-sate transducers are shown to be suitable models for this integration, permitting a full exploitation of the final interpretation constraints. Continuous-density hidden Markov models are embedded in the edges of the transducer to account for lexical and morphological constraints. Robustness with respect to stroke vertical variability is achieved by integrating tangent vectors into the emission densities of these models. Experimental results are reported on a syntax-constrained interpretation task which show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. These results are also shown to be comparatively better than those achieved with other conventional, N-gram-based techniques which do not take advantage of full integration."

The pen trajectory is recorded by a touch sensitive pad, such as those used by note-pad computers. The input to the system contains the pen trajectory information, encoded as a time-ordered sequence of feature vectors. Features include X and Y coordinates, pen-lifts, speed, direction and curvature of the pen trajectory. A time delay neural network with local connections and shared weights is used to estimate a posteriori probabilities for characters in a word. A hidden Markov model segments the word into characters in a way which optimizes the global word score, taking a dictionary into account. A geometrical normalization scheme and a fast but efficient dictionary search are also presented. Trained on 20000 unconstrained cursive words from 59 writers and using a 25000 word dictionary the authors reached a 89% character and 80% word recognition rate on test data from a disjoint set of writers.<<ETX>>"

In this framework, neural networks (and in particular, multilayer perceptrons or MLPs) have been restricted to well-defined subtasks of the whole system, i.e., HMM emission probability estimation and feature extraction. The book describes a successful five year international collaboration between the authors. The lessons learned form a case study that demonstrates how hybrid systems can be developed to combine neural networks with more traditional statistical approaches. The book illustrates both the advantages and limitations of neural networks in the framework of a statistical system. Using standard databases and comparing with some conventional approaches, it is shown that MLP probability estimation can improve recognition performance. Other approaches are discussed, though there is no such unequivocal experimental result for these methods. Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach is of use to anyone intending to use neural networks for speech recognition or within the framework provided by an existing successful statistical approach. This includes research and development groups working in the field of speech recognition, both with standard and neural network approaches, as well as other pattern recognition and/or neural network researchers. This book is also suitable as a text for advanced courses on neural networks or speech processing."

The proposed approach models words with ergodic HMMs and is designed for small vocabularies. A single neural network provides grapheme observation probabilities for all HMMs in order to compute the most likely word model. During the iterative EM like training of the hybrid, the HMMs provide the targets for the discriminant training of the neural network. An extension of the approach to letter models which can be concatenated in order to form word models and which allow for large vocabularies is also briefly discussed. We report results obtained on a large data base of words from French cheques, showing recognition rates close to 93% for the 30 word vocabulary relevant for French legal amounts."

A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

In particular, problems of phoneme recognition in continuous speech are considered, but most of the discussed techniques could be applied to other tasks, such as the recognition of sequences of handwritten characters. The systems considered in this paper are based on connectionist models, or artificial neural networks, sometimes combined with statistical techniques for recognition of sequences of patterns, stressing the integration of prior knowledge and learning. Different architectures for sequence and speech recognition are reviewed, including recurrent networks as well as hybrid systems involving hidden Markov models."

The method selects the optimal consistent combination of cuts from a set of candidate cuts generated using heuristics. The optimal segmentation is found by representing the image, the candidate segments, and their scores as a graph in which the shortest path corresponds to the optimal interpretation. The scores are given by neural net outputs for each segment. A significant advantage of the method is that the labor required to segment images manually is eliminated. The system was trained on approximately 7000 unsegmented handwritten zip codes provided by the United States Postal Service. The system has achieved a per-zip-code raw recognition rate of 81% on a 2368 handwritten zip-code test set.<<ETX>>"

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

We propose an approach that reduces this variability without requiring letter segmentation. We build an ink extrema classifier which labels local minima of ink as {bottom, baseline, other} and maxima as {midline, top, other}. Despite the high variability of ink, the classifier is 86% accurate (with 0% rejection). We use the classifier information to normalize the ink. This is done by applying a \"rubber sheet\" warping followed by a \"rubber rod\" warping. Both warpings are computed using conjugate gradient methods. We display the normalization results on a few examples. This paper illustrates the pitfalls of ink normalization and \"beautification \", when solved independently of letter recognition."

This task involves a number of processing steps, some of which are quite difficult. Typically, preprocessing, normalization, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing operations are required. We'll survey the state of the art, analyze recent trends, and try to identify challenges for future research in this field."

Now, rapidly growing computational power is enabling the implementation of the present CR methodologies and is creating an increasing demand in many emerging application domains which require more advanced methodologies. This paper serves as a guide and update for readers working in the CR area. First, the historical evolution of CR systems is presented. Then, the available CR techniques, with their superiorities and weaknesses, are reviewed. Finally, the current status of CR is discussed and directions for future research are suggested. Special attention is given to off-line handwriting recognition, since this area requires more research in order to reach the ultimate goal of machine simulation of human reading."

We mainly deal with the various methods that were proposed to realize the core of recognition in a word recognition system. These methods are discussed in view of the two most important properties of such a system: the size and nature of the lexicon involved, and whether or not a segmentation stage is present. We classify the field into three categories: segmentation-free methods, which compare a sequence of observations derived from a word image with similar references of words in the lexicon; segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word; and the perception-oriented approach, that relates to methods that perform a human-like reading technique, in which anchor features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase."

The capability of dealing with large lexicons, however, opens up many more applications. This article will discuss the methods and principles that have been proposed to handle large vocabularies and identify the key issues affecting their future deployment. To illustrate some of the points raised, a large vocabulary off-line handwritten word recognition system will be described."

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

Conventional slant correction techniques estimate the average slant angle of component characters and then correct the slant uniformly. Thus these conventional techniques will perform successfully under the assumption that each word is written with a constant slant. However, it is more widely acceptable assumption that the slant angle fluctuates during writing a word. In this paper, a nonuniform slant correction technique is presented where the slant correction problem is formulated as an optimal estimation problem of local slant angles at all horizontal positions. The optimal estimation is governed by a criterion function and several constraints for the global and local validity of the local angles. The optimal local slant angles which maximize the criterion satisfying the constraints are searched for efficiently by a dynamic programming based algorithm. Experimental results show the advantageous characteristics of the present technique over the uniform slant correction techniques."

Well-known examples include the kernel density estimate (KDE) for density estimation and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a \u201cdifference of densities\u201d. We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality, and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions. Simulation results for both synthetic and real-world data are presented."

Two algorithms to decode a tree lexicon with left-to-right models with or without skips and other algorithm which takes a directed acyclic graph as input and performs error correcting decoding are presented. They store the set of active states topologically sorted in contiguous memory queues. The number of basic operations needed to update each hypothesis is reduced and also more locality in memory is obtained reducing the expected number of cache misses and achieving a speed-up over other implementations."

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance."
