Equations are derived to relate the mean and variance of both the intensity and the range data to the physical properties of the target and the parameters of the sensor. Experimental results that verify these equations are given. Adaptive data smoothing and normalization procedures are presented. These procedures reduce photon noise and correct the intensity data for inverse square-law effects. The resulting intensity data give the product of the diffuse surface reflectance and the cosine of the angle of incidence for each picture element in the scene. Simple procedures are given for finding outlines of occluding objects, obtaining normal views of obliquely sensed planar surfaces, and extracting the images of horizontal surface regions from a scene. These procedures demonstrate the advantages of having registered reflectance and range data for scene analysis."

Current research programs based on the processing of side-looking radar imagery show that spatial alignment of the various parts of the image must be highly accurate if noise in the difference picture is to be reduced to acceptably low levels. Typically, the spatial alignment accuracy must be better than one-fourth of the diameter of the smallest resolvable feature in the imagery, and this often requires several hundred degrees of freedom in the performance of the map warp for images that are of the order of 107picture cells (pixels) in size. Gray scale rectification of conjugate sampling points is less difficult, requiring typically only 10 to 20 percent as many degrees of freedom. Point by point adjustment for differences in mean transparency and contrast is employed. Recently developed equipment provides a continuous pipeline processing capability. With this equipment, each picture element of the second image is transformed with four degrees of freedom (two spatial and two gray scale). The digital correlator is capable of processing 4\u00d7105six-bit picture elements per second when used in conjunction with a CDC 1700 computer."

Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

These include a stereo camera model solver, a high resolution stereo correlator for producing accurate matches with accuracy and confidence estimates, a search technique for using the correlator to produce a dense sampling of matched points for a pair of pictures, and a ground surface finder for distinguishing the ground from objects, in the resulting three-dimensional data. Possible ways of using these techniques in an autonomous vehicle designed to explore its environment are discussed. An example is given showing the detection of objects from a stereo pair of pictures."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

Most of them lack characteristics that would facilitate man machine communication using semantic, graphic and visual means. This report describes a formal method for describing shape that has desirable characteristics along these lines. The method uses generalized cylinders to characterize the primitives of the representation and hierarchical assemblages of primitives. A set of computer programs is described that translates formal descriptions of objects into polyhedral models and line drawings. A scanning range finder is used to obtain three-dimensional information about a scene. Then a set of computer programs characterized cones, cylinders, and rectangular solids in the image. The method is manually guided, and requires much operator interaction, but has the potential for extension to a useful system for interactive design, or for formation of the core of a three-dimensional vision system.

The solution involves arranging the cubes in a tower so that no side of the tower reveals more than one face of a given color. Our system, which runs as eight (multitask) jobs under the PDP-10 time-sharing system, uses a TV camera to locate four objects and, having verified that they are cubes, to find the color of each face. A mechanical arm turns the cubes over to expose all faces to the TV. Having found the solution, the arm then stacks the cubes into a tower to demonstrate it."
