                "text": "Antidromic activation of cells in the central nervous system has proved to be a most useful method of studying the properties of neurones and the part these play in synaptic transmission (see e.g. Renshaw, 1941, 1946; Araki, Otani & Furukawa, 1953; Brock, Coombs & Eccles, 1953; Frank & Fuortes, 1955; Granit & Phillips, 1956; Phillips, 1956, 1959; Coombs, Curtis & Eccles, 1957a, b; Fatt, 1957; Fuortes, Frank & Becker, 1957; Martin & Branch, 1958; Bennett, Crain & Grundfest, 1959; Freygang & Frank, 1959; Machne, Fadiga & Brookhart, 1959). The method is also valuable in establishing the identity of various cells and in determining the extent of a tract, on the principle that an antidromic impulse will not cross a synapse (e.g. Woolsey & Chang, 1947). However, the existence of recurrent collaterals is a complicating factor here. We have stimulated the visual cortex in cats whilst recording extracellularly from units in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and optic radiation with both these objects in mind. The LGN projects to a large area of cortex and in these experiments no attempt was made to stimulate this entire area but only the most anterior part. Evidence will be produced to show that the majority of our records result from a true antidromic activation of the unit. This is a necessary step, because it has been suggested that the visual cortex sends an efferent supply to the LGN (e.g. Vastola, 1957; Wid6n & Marsan, 1960 a, who also give a list of references to earlier work). Our results do, however, lend some support to this idea, because a few units could be activated only after rather long latencies. However, the results are most useful for the study of the process of impulse initiation in the cell body and in this respect support the theories advanced by Araki & Otani (1955), Coombs et al. (1957a, b) and Fuortes et al. (1957)."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"
