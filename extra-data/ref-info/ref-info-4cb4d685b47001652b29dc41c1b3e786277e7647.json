The detection technique we develop is based on a wavelet representation of an object class derived from a statistical analysis of the class instances. By learning an object class in terms of a subset of an overcomplete dictionary of wavelet basis functions, we derive a compact representation of an object class which is used as an input to a support vector machine classifier. This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (hand-crafted) models or motion-based segmentation. The paper also presents a motion-based extension to enhance the performance of the detection algorithm over video sequences. The results presented here suggest that this architecture may well be quite general."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

The concepts of an optimal number of features, representativeness of the training data, and the need to avoid overfitting to the training data are stressed. The chapter shows that methods such as the support vector machine and artificial neural networks are subject to these same training limitations, although each has its advantages. For neural networks, the multilayer perceptron architecture and back-propagation algorithm are described. The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning, demonstrating the advantages of the latter and showing how methods such as clustering and principal components analysis fit into the SPR framework.

In feature extraction, for instance, the features of interest in a signal are usually quite distorted. This form of noise justifies some level of quantization in order to achieve faster feature extraction. Our approach consists of approximating regions of the signal with low degree polynomials, and then differentiating the resulting signals in order to obtain impulse functions (or derivatives of impulse functions). With this representation, convolution becomes extremely simple and can be implemented quite effectively. The true convolution can be recovered by integrating the result of the convolution. This method yields substantial speed up in feature extraction and is applicable to convolutional neural networks."

The salient ones for separating particular shapes are determined by inductive learning during the construction of classification trees. There is a feature for every possible geometric arrangement of local topographic codes. The arrangements express coarse constraints on relative angles and distances among the code locations and are nearly invariant to substantial affine and nonlinear deformations. They are also partially ordered, which makes it possible to narrow the search for informative ones at each node of the tree. Different trees correspond to different aspects of shape. They are statistically and weakly dependent due to randomization and are aggregated in a simple way. Adapting the algorithm to a shape family is then fully automatic once training samples are provided. As an illustration, we classified handwritten digits from the NIST database; the error rate was 0.7 percent."

An alternative method using a single table of values representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself may yield superior results at similar cost.

The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance"
