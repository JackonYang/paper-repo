This deterministic system has collective properties in very close correspondence with the earlier stochastic model based on McCulloch - Pitts neurons. The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed."

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1."

These motor neurons innervate the longitudinal muscles in dorsal or ventral sectors of the segmental body wall. Their duty cycles are phase-locked in a manner such that the dorsal and ventral body wall sectors of any given segment undergo an antiphasic contractile rhythm and that the contractile rhythms of different segments form a rostrocaudal phase progression. This activity rhythm is imposed on the motor neurons by a central swim oscillator, of which four bilaterally symmetric pairs of interneurons present in each segmental ganglion appear to constitute the major component. These interneurons are linked intra- and intersegmentally via inhibitory connections to form a segmentally iterated and inter-segmentally concatenated cyclic neuronal network. The network appears to owe its oscillatory activity pattern to the mechanism of recurrent cyclic inhibition."

However, the patient with a disturbance of the phonemic and conceptual structure of the speech processes always experiences considerable difficulty notwithstanding the adequate preservation of the ability to engage in certain forms of abstract intellectual activity, when he attempts to carry out systematic, successive operations with relationships requiring the constant participation of speech associations as mediators. In such circumstances the ability to discriminate between relationships becomes manifestly inadequate and the patient'S intellectual operations begin to suffer. The intellectual defects of a patient with temporal aphasia become apparent in nonspeech operations in which an essential part of the process entails the use of systems of speech associations retained in the memory. For instance, a patient who could still sort out a series of pictures telling a story, provided he was allowed to mix them up himself, found the process very difficult if he was not allowed to touch the pictures and was asked to put them in the proper order as indicated by the appropriate numbers (Ombredane, 1951). These patients experience similar difficulties with series of geometrical operations. The defects were found to be particularly serious when such patients attempted to do mental arithmetical calculations. They had no difficulty in grasping numerical relationships but, although usually preserving the general plan of the necessary actions, they became helpless when given problems requiring a series of successive operations with some of the results to be kept in mind. An attempt to assist the process by allowing them to speak out loud was unsuccessful, and without the support of a well-established and differentiated system of word associations it was seriously impaired. It should be noted that the operations of discursive intellectual activity, which are wholly dependent on speech, for example, the solution of logical problems as in Burt's tests on the establishment of multiple relationships (Part III, Section 8E), remained completely beyond these patients' ability. They \u2022 Among our patients was a bookkeeper with a severe form of sensory aphasia who could still draw up the annual balance sheet in spite of severe disturbances of speech and although he was unable to remember the names of his subordinates and used to refer to them incorrectly."
