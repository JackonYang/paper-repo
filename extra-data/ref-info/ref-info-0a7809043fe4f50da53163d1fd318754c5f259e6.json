The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"

Globally maximal whites-pace rectangles have been previously demonstrated to constitute a concise representation of the major layout features of documents. However, previous methods for computing maximal whitespace rectangles were limited to axis-aligned rectangles. This paper presents an algorithm that finds globally maximal whitespace rectangles on page images at arbitrary orientations. The new algorithm eliminates the need for page rotation correction prior to background analysis and can be applied to considerably more complex page layouts than previously possible. The algorithm is resolution independent and takes as input a list of foreground shapes (e.g., character or word bounding boxes or polygons) and a set of parameter ranges; it outputs the N largest non-overlapping maximal whitespace rectangles whose parameters (location, width, height, orientation) fall within the required parameter ranges. Examples of applications of the method to severely skewed documents, as well as the UW3 database, are presented."

The system design consists of aggressively modularized components to enhance the development of individual parts which are used in the complete solution, including: Interface speciications, multipurpose feature extraction, an integrated eecient query language, physical retrieval from an object-oriented database, and delivery of retrieved objects. In this paper, we introduce the general framework, feature extraction modules, query capabilities, a graphical query interface, and the application interface.

The algorithms are considerably easier to implement than prior methods, they return globally optimal solutions, and they require no heuristics. The paper also introduces an evaluation function that reliably identifies maximal empty rectangles corresponding to column boundaries. Combining this evaluation function with the two geometric algorithms results in an easy-to-implement layout analysis system. Reliability of the system is demonstrated on documents from the UW3 database."

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

The characteristics of the proposed method are as follows: (1) The Voronoi diagram enables us to obtain the candidates of boundaries of document components from page images with non-Manhattan layout and a skew. (2) The candidates are utilized to estimate the intercharacter and interline gaps without the use of domain-specific parameters to select the boundaries. From the experimental results for 128 images with non-Manhattan layout and the skew of 0\u00b0~45\u00b0 as well as 98 images with Manhattan layout, we have confirmed that the method is effective for extraction of body text regions, and it is as efficient as other methods based on connected component analysis."

Evidence is presented indicating that, in some domains, normal (Gaussian) distributions are more accurate than uniform distributions for modeling feature fluctuations. This motivates the development of new maximum-likelihood and MAP recognition formulations which are based on normal feature models. These formulations lead to an expression for the posterior probability of the pose and correspondences given an image. Several avenues are explored for specifying a recognition hypothesis. In the first approach, correspondences are included as a part of the hypotheses. Search for solutions may be ordered as a combinatorial search in correspondence space, or as a search over pose space, where the same criterion can equivalently be viewed as a robust variant of chamfer matching. In the second approach, correspondences are not viewed as being a part of the hypotheses. This leads to a criterion that is a smooth function of pose that is amenable to local search by continuous optimization methods. The criteria is also suitable for optimization via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which alternates between pose refinement and re-estimation of correspondence probabilities until convergence is obtained. Recognition experiments are described using the criteria with features derived from video images and from synthetic range images."
