Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images."

The larger the scale of an edge, the longer range the grouping cues it designates, and the greater impact it has on the final segmentation. A good segmentation respects grouping cues at each scale. These intuitions are formulated in a graph-theoretic framework where multiscale edges define pairwise pixel affinity at multiple grids, each captured in one graph. A novel criterion called average cuts of normalized affinity is proposed to evaluate a simultaneous segmentation through all these graphs. Its near-global optima can be solved efficiently. With a sparse yet complete characterization of pairwise pixel affinity, this graph-cuts approach leads to a hierarchy of coarse to fine segmentations that naturally take care of textured regions and weak contours."

The recent literature witnessed two popular graph cut algorithms: the Ncut using spectral graph analysis and the minimum-cut using the maximum flow algorithm. We present a third major approach by generalizing the Swendsen-Wang method - a well celebrated algorithm in statistical mechanics. Our algorithm simulates ergodic, reversible Markov chain jumps in the space of graph partitions to sample a posterior probability. At each step, the algorithm splits, merges, or regroups a sizable subgraph, and achieves fast mixing at low temperature enabling a fast annealing procedure. Experiments show it converges in 2-30 seconds on a PC for image segmentation. This is 400 times faster than the single-site update Gibbs sampler, and 20-40 times faster than the DDMCMC algorithm. The algorithm can optimize over the number of models and works for general forms of posterior probabilities, so it is more general than the existing graph cut approaches."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

However, due to the computational demands of these approaches, applications to large problems such as spatiotemporal data and high resolution imagery have been slow to appear. The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning making it feasible to apply them to very large grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystrom method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

                "text": "When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.A novel concept of a scale-space edge is introduced, defined as a connected set of points in scale-space at which: (i) the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction, and (ii) a normalized measure of the strength of the edge response is locally maximal over scales. An important consequence of this definition is that it allows the scale levels to vary along the edge. Two specific measures of edge strength are analyzed in detail, the gradient magnitude and a differential expression derived from the third-order derivative in the gradient direction. For a certain way of normalizing these differential descriptors, by expressing them in terms of so-called \u03b3-normalized derivatives, an immediate consequence of this definition is that the edge detector will adapt its scale levels to the local image structure. Specifically, sharp edges will be detected at fine scales so as to reduce the shape distortions due to scale-space smoothing, whereas sufficiently coarse scales will be selected at diffuse edges, such that an edge model is a valid abstraction of the intensity profile across the edge.Since the scale-space edge is defined from the intersection of two zero-crossing surfaces in scale-space, the edges will by definition form closed curves. This simplifies selection of salient edges, and a novel significance measure is proposed, by integrating the edge strength along the edge. Moreover, the scale information associated with each edge provides useful clues to the physical nature of the edge.With just slight modifications, similar ideas can be used for formulating ridge detectors with automatic selection, having the characteristic property that the selected scales on a scale-space ridge instead reflect the width of the ridge.It is shown how the methodology can be implemented in terms of straightforward visual front-end operations, and the validity of the approach is supported by theoretical analysis as well as experiments on real-world and synthetic data."

These algorithms compute ak-way partitioning of a graphG= (V,E) inO(|E|) time, which is faster by a factor ofO(logk) than previously proposed multilevel recursive bisection algorithms. A key contribution of our work is in finding a high-quality and computationally inexpensive refinement algorithm that can improve upon an initialk-way partitioning. We also study the effectiveness of the overall scheme for a variety of coarsening schemes. We present experimental results on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that this new scheme produces partitions that are of comparable or better quality than those produced by the multilevel bisection algorithm and requires substantially smaller time. Graphs containing up to 450,000 vertices and 3,300,000 edges can be partitioned in 256 domains in less than 40 s on a workstation such as SGI's Challenge. Compared with the widely used multilevel spectral bisection algorithm, our new algorithm is usually two orders of magnitude faster and produces partitions with substantially smaller edge-cut."

A key feature of this parallel formulation is that it is able to achieve a high degree of concurrency while maintaining the high quality of the partitions produced by the serial multilevel k-way partitioning algorithm. In particular, the time taken by our parallel graph partitioning algorithm is only slightly longer than the time taken for re-arrangement of the graph among processors according to the new partition. Experiments with a variety of finite element graphs show that our parallel formulation produces high-quality partitionings in a short amount of time. For example, a 128-way partitioning of graphs with one million vertices can be computed in a little over two seconds on a 128-processor Cray T3D. Furthermore, the quality of the partitions produced is comparable (edge-cuts within 5%) to those produced by the serial multilevel k-way algorithm. Thus our parallel algorithm makes it feasible to perform frequent repartitioning of graphs in dynamic computations without compromising the partitioning quality."
