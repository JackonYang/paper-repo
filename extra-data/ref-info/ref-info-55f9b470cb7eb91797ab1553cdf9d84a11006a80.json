We believe that occlusion can provide a strong cue for object segmentation and \"pop-out\", but detecting an object's occlusion boundaries using appearance alone is a difficult problem in itself. If the camera or the scene is moving, however, that motion provides an additional powerful indicator of occlusion. Thus, we use standard appearance cues (e.g. brightness/color gradient) in addition to motion cues that capture subtle differences in the relative surface motion (i.e. parallax) on either side of an occlusion boundary. We describe a learned local classifier and global inference approach which provide a frame-work for combining and reasoning about these appearance and motion cues to estimate which region boundaries of an initial over-segmentation correspond to object/occlusion boundaries in the scene. Through results on a dataset which contains short videos with labeled boundaries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of motion cues for this task."

In the same way, computer vision algorithms must go beyond the pixels and reason about the underlying scene. In this dissertation, we propose methods to recover the basic spatial layout from a single image and begin to investigate its use as a foundation for scene understanding. Our spatial layout is a description of the 3D scene in terms of surfaces, occlusions, camera viewpoint, and objects. We propose a geometric class representation, a coarse categorization of surfaces according to their 3D orientations, and learn appearance-based models of geometry to identify surfaces in an image. These surface estimates serve as a basis for recovering the boundaries and occlusion relationships of prominent objects. We further show that simple reasoning about camera viewpoint and object size in the image allows accurate inference of the viewpoint and greatly improves object detection. Finally, we demonstrate the potential usefulness of our methods in applications to 3D reconstruction, scene synthesis, and robot navigation. Scene understanding from a single image requires strong assumptions about the world. We show that the necessary assumptions can be modeled statistically and learned from training data. Our work demonstrates the importance of robustness through a wide variety of image cues, multiple segmentations, and a general strategy of soft decisions and gradual inference of image structure. Above all, our work manifests the tremendous amount of 3D information that can be gleaned from a single image. Our hope is that this dissertation will inspire others to further explore how computer vision can go beyond pattern recognition and produce an understanding of the environment."

This ability is completely missing in most popular recognition algorithms, which pretend that the world is flat and/or view it through a patch-sized peephole. Yet it seems very likely that having a grasp of this \u201csurface layout\u201d of a scene should be of great assistance for many tasks, including recognition, navigation, and novel view synthesis.In this paper, we take the first step towards constructing the surface layout, a labeling of the image intogeometric classes. Our main insight is to learn appearance-based models of these geometric classes, which coarsely describe the 3D scene orientation of each image region. Our multiple segmentation framework provides robust spatial support, allowing a wide variety of cues (e.g., color, texture, and perspective) to contribute to the confidence in each geometric label. In experiments on a large set of outdoor images, we evaluate the impact of the individual cues and design choices in our algorithm. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method to indoor images, describe potential applications, and discuss extensions to a more complete notion of surface layout."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

Object categories are modeled via distributions over the 3D location and appearance of visual features. Uncertainty in the number of object instances depicted in a particular image is then achieved via a transformed Dirichlet process. In contrast with image-based approaches to object recognition, we model scale variations as the perspective projection of objects in different 3D poses. To calibrate the underlying geometry, we incorporate binocular stereo images into the training process. A robust likelihood model accounts for outliers in matched stereo features, allowing effective learning of 3D object structure from partial 2D segmentations. Applied to a dataset of office scenes, our model detects objects at multiple scales via a coarse reconstruction of the corresponding 3D geometry."

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and global-image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps."

The central goal is to shield the user from all of the arduous tasks typically involved in image compositing. The user is only asked to do two simple things: 1) pick a 3D location in the scene to place a new object; 2) select an object to insert using a hierarchical menu. We pose the problem of object insertion as a data-driven, 3D-based, context-sensitive object retrieval task. Instead of trying to manipulate the object to change its orientation, color distribution, etc. to fit the new image, we simply retrieve an object of a specified class that has all the required properties (camera pose, lighting, resolution, etc) from our large object library. We present new automatic algorithms for improving object segmentation and blending, estimating true 3D object size and orientation, and estimating scene lighting conditions. We also present an intuitive user interface that makes object insertion fast and simple even for the artistically challenged."

In this paper, we develop a computational model for figure/ground assignment in complex natural scenes. We utilize a large dataset of images annotated with human-marked segmentations and figure/ground labels for training and quantitative evaluation. \n \nWe operationalize the concept of familiar configuration by constructing prototypical local shapes, i.e. shapemes, from image data. Shapemes automatically encode mid-level visual cues to figure/ground assignment such as convexity and parallelism. Based on the shapeme representation, we train a logistic classifier to locally predict figure/ground labels. We also consider a global model using a conditional random field (CRF) to enforce global figure/ground consistency at T-junctions. We use loopy belief propagation to perform approximate inference on this model and learn maximum likelihood parameters from ground-truth labels. \n \nWe find that the local shapeme model achieves an accuracy of 64% in predicting the correct figural assignment. This compares favorably to previous studies using classical figure/ground cues [1]. We evaluate the global model using either a set of contours extracted from a low-level edge detector or the set of contours given by human segmentations. The global CRF model significantly improves the performance over the local model, most notably when using human-marked boundaries (78%). These promising experimental results show that this is a feasible approach to bottom-up figure/ground assignment in natural images."

In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thin-lines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, specifically contrast edges, ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we define a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy configuration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour figures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difficult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost."

To achieve this we combine two ideas: (i) that a set of segmented objects can be partitioned into visual object classes using topic discovery models from statistical text analysis; and (ii) that visual object classes can be used to assess the accuracy of a segmentation. To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations. We demonstrate that such an algorithm succeeds in automatically discovering many familiar objects in a variety of image datasets, including those from Caltech, MSRC and LabelMe."

Running computer programs implement the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception.

The model is made up of several texture-mapped planar billboards and has the complexity of a typical children's pop-up book illustration. Our main insight is that instead of attempting to recover precise geometry, we statistically model geometric classes defined by their orientations in the scene. Our algorithm labels regions of the input image into coarse categories: \"ground\", \"sky\", and \"vertical\". These labels are then used to \"cut and fold\" the image into a pop-up model using a set of simple assumptions. Because of the inherent ambiguity of the problem and the statistical nature of the approach, the algorithm is not expected to work on every image. However. it performs surprisingly well for a wide range of scenes taken from a typical person's photo album."

It is assumed that the line drawing has been formed by orthographic projection of such a scene under general viewpoint, that the line drawing is error free, and that there are no lines due to shadows or specularities. Our definition implicitly excludes laminae, wires, and the apices of cones.A major component of the interpretation of line drawings is line labelling. By line labelling we mean (a) classification of each image curve as corresponding to either a depth or orientation discontinuity in the scene, and (b) further subclassification of each kind of discontinuity. For a depth discontinuity we determine whether it is a limb\u2014a locus of points on the surface where the line of sight is tangent to the surface\u2014or an occluding edge\u2014a tangent plane discontinuity of the surface. For an orientation discontinuity, we determine whether it corresponds to a convex or concave edge. This paper presents the first mathematically rigorous scheme for labelling line drawings of the class of scenes described. Previous schemes for labelling line drawings of scenes containing curved objects were heuristic, incomplete, and lacked proper mathematical justification.By analyzing the projection of the neighborhoods of different kinds of points on a piecewise smooth surface, we are able to catalog all local labelling possibilities for the different types of junctions in a line drawing. An algorithm is developed which utilizes this catalog to determine all legal labellings of the line drawing. A local minimum complexity rule\u2014at each vertex select those labellings which correspond to the minimum number of faces meeting at the vertex\u2014is used in order to prune highly counter-intuitive interpretations. The labelling scheme was implemented and tested on a number of line drawings. The labellings obtained are few and by and large in accordance with human interpretations."

Motion boundaries are represented using a non-linear generative model that explicitly encodes the orientation of the boundary, the velocities on either side, the motion of the occluding edge over time, and the appearance/disappearance of pixels at the boundary. We represent the posterior probability distribution over the model parameters given the image data using discrete samples. This distribution is propagated over time using a particle filtering algorithm. To efficiently represent such a high-dimensional space we initialize samples using the responses of a low-level motion discontinuity detector. The formulation and computational model provide a general probabilistic framework for motion estimation with multiple, non-linear, models."

They are viewpoint dependent and characterized by the fact that the optical rays of their points are tangential to the surface of the object. The mathematics of the relationship between the extremal boundaries and the surface of the object is studied. This study makes it possible to design an algorithm for detecting those boundaries in the images that are likely to be extremal. Once this has been done, one can reconstruct the rims and compute the differential properties of the surface of the object along them up to the second order. If a qualitative description is sufficient, the sign of the Gaussian curvature of the surface along the rim can be computed in a much simpler way. Experimental results are presented on synthetic and real images. The work provides a better understanding of the relationship between the apparent and real shape of a 3-D object as well as algorithms for reconstructing the local shape of such an object along the rims. >"

The energy is defined on the space of boundaries in the image domain and can incorporate very general combinations of modeling information both from the boundary (intensity gradients, etc.) and from the interior of the region (texture, homogeneity, etc.). We describe two polynomial-time digraph algorithms for finding the global minima of this energy. One of the algorithms is completely general, minimizing the functional for any choice of modeling information. It runs in a few seconds on a 256/spl times/256 image. The other algorithm applies to a subclass of functionals, but has the advantage of being extremely parallelizable. Neither algorithm requires initialization."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

In contrast to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images. We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale. As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity, providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this method."

Fixed points of these algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energy (Yedidia et al., 2001). However, belief propagation does not always converge, which motivates approaches that explicitly minimize the Kikuchi/Bethe free energy, such as CCCP (Yuille, 2002) and UPS (Teh and Welling, 2002). Here we describe a class of algorithms that solves this typically non-convex constrained minimization problem through a sequence of convex constrained minimizations of upper bounds on the Kikuchi free energy. Intuitively one would expect tighter bounds to lead to faster algorithms, which is indeed convincingly demonstrated in our simulations. Several ideas are applied to obtain tight convex bounds that yield dramatic speed-ups over CCCP."

The striking similarity of the two problems in this framework allows us to design and analyze algorithms for both simultaneously, and to easily adapt algorithms designed for one problem to the other. For both problems, we give new algorithms and explain their potential advantages over existing methods. These algorithms are iterative and can be divided into two types based on whether the parameters are updated sequentially (one at a time) or in parallel (all at once). We also describe a parameterized family of algorithms that includes both a sequential- and a parallel-update algorithm as special cases, thus showing how the sequential and parallel approaches can themselves be unified. For all of the algorithms, we give convergence proofs using a general formalization of the auxiliary-function proof technique. As one of our sequential-update algorithms is equivalent to AdaBoost, this provides the first general proof of convergence for AdaBoost. We show that all of our algorithms generalize easily to the multiclass case, and we contrast the new algorithms with the iterative scaling algorithm. We conclude with a few experimental results with synthetic data that highlight the behavior of the old and newly proposed algorithms in different settings."

Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP. Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge). Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally, we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications."
