A successful page segmentation is a necessary precondition for a document recognition process to be successful. The problems addressed here are: design methods to describe all possible correct segmentations for a given page and design methods to compare two segmentations. The proposed segmentation ground truth representation scheme defines ground truth text regions as non-mergeable maximal sets of text lines, merged in a language- dependent direction. It includes the other possible correct segmentations in that authorized cuts in the region are explicitly specified. At this low-level stage, quality criteria for a page segmentation are mainly defined as providing correct input for region ordering and classification. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation method tests the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as being the black pixels contained in the derived polygons."

The structure of the background (white space) is analyzed, assisted by an enumeration of all maximal white rectangles. For this enumeration, the most computationally expensive step, an algorithm has been developed that, aside from a sort, achieves an expected runtime linear in the number of black connected components. The crucial engineering decision is the specification of a partial order on white rectangles to express domain-specific knowledge of preferred shapes and sizes. This order determines a sequence of partial covers of the background, and thus, a sequence of nested page segmentations. In experimental trials on Manhattan layouts, good segmentations often occur early in this sequence, using a simple and uniform shape-direction rule. This is a global-to-local strategy, which for some tasks is superior to strategies currently emphasized in the literature, including bottom-up and top-down.<<ETX>>"

This is the first book to offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art research papers, including authoritative critical surveys of the literature, and parallel studies of the architectureof complete high-performance printed-document reading systems. A unique feature is the extended section on music notation, an ideal vehicle for international sharing of basic research. Also, the collection includes important new work on line drawings, handwriting, character and symbol recognition, and basic methodological issues. The IAPR 1990 Workshop on Syntactic and Structural Pattern Recognition is summarized,including the reports of its expert working groups, whose debates provide a fascinating perspective on the field. The book is an excellent text for a first-year graduate seminar in document image analysis,and is likely to remain a standard reference in the field for years."

Establishing the essential properties of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases."
