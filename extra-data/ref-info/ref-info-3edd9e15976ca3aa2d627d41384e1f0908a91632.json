The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the \"semantic\" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves."

This was possible by combining the advantages of SVM - convexity and the availability of efficient optimizers, with 'hyperkernels' - linear combinations of kernels computed at multiple levels of image encoding. The use of hyperkernels faces the challenge of choosing the kernel weights, the use of possibly irrelevant, poorly performing kernels, and an increased number of parameters that can lead to overfitting. In this paper we advocate the transition from SVMs to Support Kernel Machines (SKM) - models that estimate both the parameters of a sparse linear combination of kernels, and the parameters of a discriminative classifier. We exploit recent kernel learning techniques, not previously used in computer vision, that show how learning SKMs can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently using Sequential Minimal Optimization. We study kernel learning for several multi-level image encodings for supervised object recognition and report competitive results on several datasets, including INRIA pedestrian, Caltech 101 and the newly created Caltech 256."

This kernel is also shown to enhance retrieval based on data similarity. Specifically, we describe KernelBoost - a boosting algorithm which computes a kernel function as a combination of 'weak' space partitions. The kernel learning method naturally incorporates domain knowledge in the form of unlabeled data (i.e. in a semi-supervised or transductive settings), and also in the form of labeled samples from relevant related problems (i.e. in a learning-to-learn scenario). The latter goal is accomplished by learning a single kernel function for all classes. We show comparative evaluations of our method on datasets from the UCI repository. We demonstrate performance enhancement on two challenging tasks: digit classification with kernel SVM, and facial image retrieval based on image similarity as measured by the learnt kernel."

Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for the support vector machine (SVM), and showed that the optimization of the coefficients of such a combination reduces to a convex optimization problem known as a quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Unfortunately, current convex optimization toolboxes can solve this problem only for a small number of kernels and a small number of data points; moreover, the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) techniques that are essential in large-scale implementations of the SVM cannot be applied because the cost function is non-differentiable. We propose a novel dual formulation of the QCQP as a second-order cone programming problem, and show how to exploit the technique of Moreau-Yosida regularization to yield a formulation to which SMO techniques can be applied. We present experimental results that show that our SMO-based algorithm is significantly more efficient than the general-purpose interior point methods available in current optimization toolboxes."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex"

Previously, Frey and Jojic introduced transformation-invariant component analysis (TCA) to learn a linear mapping, invariant to a set of known form of global transformations. However, parameter estimation in that model using the previously-proposed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm required scalar operations in the order of N2 where N is the dimensionality of each training example. This is prohibitive for many applications of interest such as modeling mid-to large-size images, where, for instance, N may be as high as 786432 (512\u00d7512 RGB image). In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that reduces the computational requirements to order of Nlog\u2009N. With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of transformation-invariant component analysis in various applications including tracking, learning video textures, clustering, object recognition and object detection in images. Software for TCA can be downloaded from http://www.psi.toronto.edu/fastTCA.htm.\n"

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Such clustering requirements are generic to a number of problems in computer vision.We extend existing techniques for affine-invariant clustering, and show that the new distance metric outperforms existing approximations to affine invariant distance computation, particularly under large transformations. In addition, we incorporate prior probabilities on the transformation parameters. This further regularizes the solution, mitigating a rare but serious tendency of the existing solutions to diverge. For the particular special case of corresponding point sets we demonstrate that the affine invariant measure we introduced may be obtained in closed form.As an application of these ideas we demonstrate that the faces of the principal cast of a feature film can be generated automatically using clustering with appropriate invariance. This is a very demanding test as it involves detecting and clustering over tens of thousands of images with the variances including changes in viewpoint, lighting, scale and expression."

(2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classification, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-infinite linear program that can be efficiently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classification. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun ."

We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors fix. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overfitting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach."

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously."

The performance of the overall system is critically dependent on the distance measure used in the nearest neighbor search. A distance measure that minimizes the misclassification risk for the 1-nearest neighbor search can be shown to be the probability that a pair of input image measurements belong to different classes. In practice, we model the optimal distance measure using a linear logistic model that combines the discriminative powers of more elementary distance measures associated with a collection of simple to construct feature spaces like color, texture and local shape properties. Furthermore, in order to perform search over large training sets efficiently, the same framework was extended to find hamming distance measures associated with simple discriminators. By combining this discrete distance model with the continuous model, we obtain a hierarchical distance model that is both fast and accurate. Finally, the nearest neighbor search over object part classes was integrated into a whole object detection system and evaluated against an indoor detection task yielding good results."

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

A statistical approach is developed where textures are modelled by the joint probability distribution of filter responses. This distribution is represented by the frequency histogram of filter response cluster centres (textons). Recognition proceeds from single, uncalibrated images and the novelty here is that rotationally invariant filters are used and the filter response space is low dimensional.Classification performance is compared with the filter banks and methods of Leung and Malik [IJCV, 2001], Schmid [CVPR, 2001] and Cula and Dana [IJCV, 2004] and it is demonstrated that superior performance is achieved here. Classification results are presented for all 61 materials in the Columbia-Utrecht texture database.We also discuss the effects of various parameters on our classification algorithm--such as the choice of filter bank and rotational invariance, the size of the texton dictionary as well as the number of training images used. Finally, we present a method of reliably measuring relative orientation co-occurrence statistics in a rotationally invariant manner, and discuss whether incorporating such information can enhance the classifier\u2019s performance."

In this paper, we present an algorithm that computes the entire regularization path for these problems. The path is obtained by using numerical continuation techniques, and involves a running time complexity that is a constant times the complexity of solving the problem for one value of the regularization parameter. Working in the setting of kernel linear regression and kernel logistic regression, we show empirically that the effect of the block 1-norm regularization differs notably from the (non-block) 1-norm regularization commonly used for variable selection, and that the regularization path is of particular value in the block case."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

Due to the possibly large intraclass feature variations, using only a single unified kernel-based classifier may not satisfactorily solve the problem. Our approach is to carry out the recognition task with adaptive ensemble kernel machines, each of which is derived from proper localization and regularization. Specifically, for each training sample, we learn a distinct ensemble kernel constructed in a way to give good classification performance for data falling within the corresponding neighborhood. We achieve this effect by aligning each ensemble kernel with a locally adapted target kernel, followed by smoothing out the discrepancies among kernels of nearby data. Our experimental results on various image databases manifest that the technique to optimize local ensemble kernels is effective and consistent for object recognition."

If the amount of data and computational resources are near infinite, many algorithmes will probably converge to the optimal solution. When this is not the case, one has to introduce regularizers and a-priori knowledge to supplement the available data in order to boost the performance. Invariance (or known dependance) with respect to transformation of the input is a frequent occurrence of such an a-priori knowledge. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of tangent vectors, which compactly represent the essence of these transformation invariances, and two classes of algorithms, \u201cTangent distance\u201d and \u2018Tangent propagation\u201d, which make use of these invariances to improve performance."

A standard method for learning perceptual representations that are invariant to viewpoint is to form temporal associations across image sequences showing object transformations. However, this method requires that individual stimuli be presented in isolation and is therefore unlikely to succeed in real-world applications where multiple objects can co-occur in the visual input. This paper proposes a simple modification to the learning method that can overcome this limitation and results in more robust learning of invariant representations."

Recently, Ong et al. introduced the method of hyperkernels which can be used to learn the kernel function directly in an inductive setting. However, the associated optimization problem is a semidefinite program (SDP), which is very computationally expensive, even with the recent advances in interior point methods. In this paper, we show that this learning problem can be equivalently reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP), which can then be solved more efficiently than SDPs. Comparison is also made with the kernel matrix learning method proposed by Lanckriet et al. Experimental results on both classification and regression problems, with toy and real-world data sets, show that our proposed SOCP formulation has significant speedup over the original SDP formulation. Moreover, it yields better generalization than Lanckriet et al.'s method, with a speed that is comparable, or sometimes even faster, than their quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) formulation."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

Texture variations due to changes in scale are amongst the hardest to handle. One of the most successful methods of dealing with such variations is based on choosing interest points and selecting their characteristic scales [Lazebnik et al. PAMI 2005]. However, selecting a characteristic scale can be unstable for many textures. Furthermore, the reliance on an interest point detector and the inability to evaluate features densely can be serious limitations. Fractals present a mathematically well founded alternative to dealing with the problem of scale. However, they have not become popular as texture features due to their lack of discriminative power. This is primarily because: (a) fractal based classification methods have avoided statistical characterisations of textures (which is essential for accurate analysis) by using global features; and (b) fractal dimension features are unable to distinguish between key texture primitives such as edges, corners and uniform regions. In this paper, we overcome these drawbacks and develop local fractal features that are evaluated densely. The features are robust as they do not depend on choosing interest points or characteristic scales. Furthermore, it is shown that the local fractal dimension is invariant to local bi-Lipschitz transformations whereas its extension is able to correctly distinguish between fundamental texture primitives. Textures are characterised statistically by modelling the full joint PDF of these features. This allows us to develop a texture classification framework which is discriminative, robust and achieves state-of-the-art performance as compared to affine invariant and fractal based methods."

                "text": "This thesis presents research in the field of distance learning. Distance functions are extensively used in various application domains and also serve as an important building block in many types of algorithms. Despite their abundance, until recently only canonical distance functions such as the Euclidean distance have been used, or alternatively various application specific distance functions have been suggested, which in most cases were handdesigned to incorporate domain specific knowledge. In the last several years there has been a growing body of work on algorithms for learning distance functions. A considerable amount of different distance learning algorithms have been suggested, most of which aim at learning a restricted form of distance functions called Mahalanobis metrics. In this thesis I will present three novel distance learning algorithms: 1. Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) An algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis metric using positive equivalence constraints. 2. DistBoost A boosting based algorithm which can learn highly non-linear distance functions using equivalence constraints. 3. KernelBoost A variant of the DistBoost algorithm which learns Kernel functions, which can be used in any kernel-based classifier. I will then describe their applications to various data domains, which include clustering, image-retrieval, computational immunology, auditory data analysis and kernel-based classification. In all of these application domains, significant improvement is made when using a learned distance function instead of a standard off-the-shelf distance function. These results demonstrate the importance of this growing research field. The first two chapters of this work present a general introduction to the field of distance functions, and distance function learning, with some additional background on semi-supervised learning: Chapter 1 Introduction: In Chapter 1 we provide a general introduction to distance functions, and some reasons why the distance learning problem is an important and interesting learning scenario. We then provide a detailed overview of canonical and hand-designed distance functions. The algorithms presented in this thesis are all from the field of semi-supervised learning. We therefore present a short introduction to the field of semi-supervised learning, with a specific focus on learning using equivalence constraints, which is"

To this end we develop and optimize a nearest neighbour classifier architecture, which is evaluated on a very challenging database of flower images. The flower categories are chosen to be indistinguishable on colour alone (for example), and have considerable variation in shape, scale, and viewpoint. We demonstrate that by developing a visual vocabulary that explicitly represents the various aspects (colour, shape, and texture) that distinguish one flower from another, we can overcome the ambiguities that exist between flower categories. The novelty lies in the vocabulary used for each aspect, and how these vocabularies are combined into a final classifier. The various stages of the classifier (vocabulary selection and combination) are each optimized on a validation set. Results are presented on a dataset of 1360 images consisting of 17 flower species. It is shown that excellent performance can be achieved, far surpassing standard baseline algorithms using (for example) colour cues alone."

This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes the MKL approach tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs several iterations before converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation. Weights on each kernel matrix are included in the standard SVM empirical risk minimization problem with a l1 constraint to encourage sparsity. We propose an algorithm for solving this problem and provide an new insight on MKL algorithms based on block 1-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm converges rapidly and its efficiency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms."

Several recipes for constructing hyperkernels are provided, as well as the details of common machine learning problems. Experimental results for classification, regression and novelty detection on UCI data show the feasibility of our approach."

We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy. Hence, the approach provides a principled method of performing transduction."

For complex and high-dimensional problems such as pose estimation, the number of required examples and the computational complexity rapidly become prohibitively high. We introduce a new algorithm that learns a set of hashing functions that efficiently index examples relevant to a particular estimation task. Our algorithm extends locality-sensitive hashing, a recently developed method to find approximate neighbors in time sublinear in the number of examples. This method depends critically on the choice of hash functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call parameter-sensitive hashing, can rapidly and accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a large database of example images."

From an information-theoretic point of view, imposing invariance results in reduced (rather than improved) system performance. In fact, in the case of small training samples, the situation is reversed, and invariant operators may reduce the misclassification rate. We propose an analysis of this interesting behavior based on the bias-variance dilemma, and present experimental results confirming our theoretical expectations. In addition, we introduce the concept of \"randomized invariants\" for training, which can be used to mitigate the effect of small sample size."

It is based upon minimizing the summed component-wise (pixel-wise) entropies over a continuous set of transforms on the data. One of the biproducts of this minimization is a set of transform, one associated with each original training sample. We then demonstrate a procedure for effectively bringing test data into correspondence with the data-defined model produced in the congealing process. Subsequently; we develop a probability density over the set of transforms that arose from the congealing process. We suggest that this density over transforms may be shared by many classes, and demonstrate how using this density as \"prior knowledge\" can be used to develop a classifier based on only a single training example for each class."

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day."

We solve the problem of finding an optimal set of masks by designing a neural network which is trained to maximize a relevant function. Two algorithms, the centroid algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm, are used to train the network. Experimental results on segmenting two natural textures and extracting barcodes in an image are reported, and the error rates compared for both the algorithms with different network configurations. The centroid algorithm gives better results in small parameter spaces, whereas the gradient descent algorithm works better with more parameters. Our method of automatically generating texture discrimination masks not only results in a good segmentation performance, but also reduces the dimensionality of the feature space compared to previously published multichannel filtering methods.<<ETX>>"

Our approach is predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual \u201ccauses\u201d and that images which are visually similar share causes. We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 46,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few example images, and the AdaBoost algorithm is used to learn a classification function which depends on a small number of the most appropriate features. This yields a highly efficient classification function. In addition we show that the AdaBoost framework provides a natural mechanism for the incorporation of relevance feedback. Finally we show results on a wide variety of image queries."

Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories.

To do so, we modify the booster so as to accommodate kernel operators. We also devise an efficient weak-learner for simple kernels that is based on generalized eigen vector decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and on the USPS dataset. On the USPS dataset, the performance of the Perceptron algorithm with learned kernels is systematically better than a fixed RBF kernel."

Such an interactive system will be useful for authoring, teleconferencing, or as a control interface for a character in a game. In our implementation, the user performs in front of three video cameras; the resulting silhouettes are used to estimate his orientation and body con\ufb01guration based on a set of discriminative local features. Those features are selected by a machine learning algorithm during a preprocessing step. Sequences of motions that approximate the user\u2019s actions are extracted from the motion database and scaled in time to match the speed of the user\u2019s motion. We use swing dancing, an example of complex human motion, to demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of our approach.

Some approaches to optimal filter design have been presented. A few approaches to multi-texture optimal filter bank design have also been presented, but they are all restricted to very small sets of free parameters. In this paper a new technique for multiple texture optimal design of a bank of general finite impulse response (FIR) filters is presented.

The main convergence result is obtained by defining a projected gradient, and proving that the gradient projection method forces the sequence of projected gradients to zero. A consequence of this result is that if the gradient projection method converges to a nondegenerate point of a linearly constrained problem, then the active and binding constraints are identified in a finite number of iterations. As an application of our theory, we develop quadratic programming algorithms that iteratively explore a subspace defined by the active constraints. These algorithms are able to drop and add many constraints from the active set, and can either compute an accurate minimizer by a direct method, or an approximate minimizer by an iterative method of the conjugate gradient type. Thus, these algorithms are attractive for large scale problems. We show that it is possible to develop a finite terminating quadratic programming algorithm without non-degeneracy assumptions."
