In the present paper, a novel keyword spotting system for handwritten documents is described. It is derived from a neural network based system for unconstrained handwriting recognition. As such it performs template-free spotting, i.e. it is not necessary for a keyword to appear in the training set. The keyword spotting is done using a modification of the CTC Token Passing algorithm. We demonstrate that such a system has the potential for high performance. For example, a precision of 95% at 50% recall is reached for the 4,000 most frequent words on the IAM offline handwriting database."

In this paper, we present a word spotting system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that uses trained subword models to spot keywords. With the proposed method, arbitrary keywords can be spotted that do not need to be present in the training set. Also, no text line segmentation is required. On the modern IAM off-line database and the historical George Washington database we show that the proposed system outperforms a standard template matching approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW)."

Storing scanned pages of written text can save the information from degradation, but it does not make the textual information readily available. Automatic keyword spotting systems for handwritten historic documents can fill this gap. However, most such systems have trouble with the great variety of writing styles. It is not uncommon for handwriting processing systems to be built for just a single book. In this paper we show that neural network based keyword spotting systems are flexible enough to be used successfully on historic data, even when they are trained on a modern handwriting database. We demonstrate that with little transcribed historic text, added to the training set, the performance can further be enhanced."

Our main contribution is to derive writer-specific word models by statistically adapting an initial universal codebook to each document. This process is unsupervised and does not even require the appearance of the keyword(s) in the searched document. Experimental results show an increase in performance when this adaptation technique is applied. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work dealing with adaptation for word spotting."

Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques.

Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts, the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set. With an average precision of 72%, a combination of features outperforms competing techniques in speed and precision."

The system accepts a query in the form of text from the user and returns a ranked list of word images from document image corpus based on similarity with the query word. The system is divided into two main components. The first component known as Indexer, performs indexing of all word images present in the document image corpus. This is achieved by extracting Moment Based features from word images and storing them as index. A template is generated for keyword spotting which stores the mapping of a keyword string to its corresponding word image which is used for generating query feature vector. The second component, Similarity Matcher, returns a ranked list of word images which are most similar to the query based on a cosine similarity metric. A manual Relevance feedback is applied based on Rocchio\u2019s formula, which re-formulates the query vector to return an improved ranked listing of word images. The performance of the system is seen to be superior on printed text than on handwritten text. Experiments are reported on documents of three different languages: English, Hindi and Sanskrit. For handwritten English, an average precision of 67% was obtained for 30 query words. For machine printed Hindi, an average precision of 71% was obtained for 75 query words and for Sanskrit, an average precision of 87% with 100 queries was obtained.

Our approach overcomes the drawbacks of generative HMM modeling by applying a discriminative learning procedure that non-linearly maps speech features into an abstract vector space. By incorporating the outputs of a BLSTM network into the speech features, it is able to make use of past and future context for phoneme predictions. The robustness of the approach is evaluated on a keyword spotting task using the HUMAINE Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) database, which contains accented, spontaneous, and emotionally colored speech. The test is particularly stringent because the system is not trained on the SAL database, but only on the TIMIT corpus of read speech. We show that our method prevails over a discriminative keyword spotter without BLSTM-enhanced feature functions, which in turn has been proven to outperform HMM-based techniques."

In this contribution, we propose to apply this framework to handwritten word-spotting. Given a word image and a keyword generative model, the idea is to generate a vector which describes how the parameters of the keyword model should be modified to best fit the word image.This vector can then be used as the input of a discriminative classifier. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15\\% relative reduction of the error but the detector is approximately 15 times slower."

The candidate words that are searched in the documents are retrieved and ranked, where the ranking criterion is a similarity score between the query and the candidate words based on global word shape features. This renders the word spotting technique to be independent of the script used. The performance of system is seen to be better for printed text as compared to handwritten. For handwritten English, a precision of 60% was obtained at a recall of 50%. An alternate approach comprising of prototype selection and word matching, that yields a better performance for handwritten documents is also discussed.

Three main components of the system are a word segmenter, a shape based matcher for words and a search interface. The user types in a query in English within a search window, the system finds the equivalent Arabic word, e.g., by dictionary look-up, locates word images in an indexed (segmented) set of documents. A two-step approach is employed in performing the search: (1) prototype selection: the query is used to obtain a set of handwritten samples of that word from a known set of writers (these are the prototypes), and (2) word matching: the prototypes are used to spot each occurrence of those words in the indexed document database. A ranking is performed on the entire set of test word images-- where the ranking criterion is a similarity score between each prototype word and the candidate words based on global word shape features. A database of 20,000 word images contained in 100 scanned handwritten Arabic documents written by 10 different writers was used to study retrieval performance. Using five writers for providing prototypes and the other five for testing, using manually segmented documents, 55% precision is obtained at 50% recall. Performance increases as more writers are used for training."

Document images are processed for extraction of salient information using a word spotting technique which does not need line and word segmentation and is language independent.A multi-class library of connected components of document text is created based on six features. The spotting is performed using Euclidean distance measure enhanced by rotation and dynamic time wrapping transforms. The method is applied to a dataset from Juma Al Majid Center (Dubai)with promising results. A promising performance of the word spotting technique is obtained using an automatic preprocessing stage. In this stage, using content-level classifiers, accurate stroke pixels are extracted in a robust way. The preprocessed document images are also more legible to the end user and are less costly to archive and transfer."

The presented features are inspired by the SIFT keypoint descriptor, widely employed in computer vision and object recognition, but underexploited in the handwriting recognition field. In our approach, a sliding window moves from left to right over a word image. At each position, the window is subdivided into cells, and in each cell a histogram of orientations is accumulated. Experiments using two different word spotting systems hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping demonstrate a very significant improvement when using the proposed features with respect to the state-of-the-art ones."

For each keyword, two statistical models, called pseudo 2-D hidden Markov models, are created for representing the actual keyword and all the other extraneous words, respectively. Dynamic programming is then used for matching an unknown input word with the two models and for making a maximum likelihood decision. Although the models are pseudo 2-D in the sense that they are not fully connected 2-D networks, they are shown to be general enough in characterizing printed words efficiently. These models facilitate a nice \"elastic matching\" property in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes the recognizer not only independent of size and slant but also tolerant of highly deformed and noisy words. The system is evaluated on a synthetically created database that contains about 26000 words. Currently, the authors achieve a recognition accuracy of 99% when words in testing and training sets are of the same font size, and 96% when they are in different sizes. In the latter case, the conventional 1-D HMM achieves only a 70% accuracy rate. >"

A set of visual templates is used to define the keyword class of interest, and initiate a search for words exhibiting high shape similarity to the model set. Major problems of segmenting cursive script into individual words are avoided by applying line-oriented processing to the document pages. The use of profile-oriented features facilitates the application of dynamic programming techniques to pattern matching, and allows us to achieve high levels of recognition performance. Results of experiments with old Spanish manuscripts show a high recognition rate of the proposed approach."

Examples include the early Presidential papers at the Library of Congress and the collected works of W. B. DuBois at the library of the University of Massachusetts. The standard technique for indexing documents is to scan them in, convert them to machine readable form (ASCII) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then index them using a text retrieval engine. However, OCR does not work well on handwriting. Here, an alternative scheme is proposed for indexing such texts. Each page of the document is segmented into words. The images of the words are then matched against each other to create equivalence classes (each equivalence classes contains multiple instances of the same word). The user then provides ASCII equivalents for say the top 2000 equivalence classes. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Due to variations in even a single person\u2019s handwriting, it is expected that the matching will be the most diff icult step in the whole process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method, based on Euclidean distance mapping, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method, based on an algorithm developed by Scott and Longuet-Higgins, matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

Our aim is to address a methodology which is segmentation-free since in many cases of historical documents, the segmentation process does not produce meaningful results due to unconstraint layout, several degradations or typesetting imperfections. The proposed method is based on block-based document image descriptors that are used at a template matching process satisfying invariance in terms of translation, rotation and scaling. Improvement in terms of time expense is obtained by applying the matching process only on salient regions of the image. Experimental results on a database with representative historical printed documents prove the efficiency of the proposed approach."

Given a collection of documents written by a single author (or a few authors), one can apply a technique called word spotting. The approach is to cluster word images based on their visual appearance, after segmenting them from the documents. Annotation can then be performed for clusters rather than documents. Given segmented pages, matching handwritten word images in historical documents is a great challenge due to the variations in handwriting and the noise in the images. We describe investigations into a number of different matching techniques for word images. These include shape context matching, SSD correlation, Euclidean Distance Mapping and dynamic time warping. Experimental results show that dynamic time warping works best and gives an average precision of around 70% on a test set of 2000 word images (from ten pages) from the George Washington corpus. Dynamic time warping is relatively expensive and we will describe approaches to speeding up the computation so that the approach scales. Our immediate goal is to process a set of 100 page images with a longer term goal of processing all 6000 available pages."

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

In order to make images of valuable old documents amenable to browsing, a transcription of high accuracy is needed. In this paper, two state-of-the art recognizers originally developed for modern scripts are applied to medieval documents. The first is based on Hidden Markov Models and the second uses a Neural Network with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. On a dataset of word images extracted from a medieval manuscript of the 13th century, written in Middle High German by several writers, it is demonstrated that a word accuracy of 93.32% is achievable. This is far above the word accuracy of 77.12% achieved with the same recognizers for unconstrained modern scripts written in English. These results encourage the development of real world systems for automatic transcription of historical documents with a view to image and text browsing in digital libraries."

The evaluation is performed on documents gathered from the collection of the historical medical digital library Medic@. A method based on perceptual grouping simultaneously segments the vertical and horizontal text lines in a page. Spatial relationships between the text lines and the graphics are considered to select a set of caption line candidates. A feature-based wordspotting method is proposed to retrieve the occurrences of word images similar to a given query.Word-spotting is applied to detect the label of the captions, a word like \u2018Fig\u2019, \u2018FIG\u2019, \u2018Figure\u2019 ...followed by the figure number. Combining spatial information and word recognition greatly improve the detection of caption lines. Our initial experiments process more than 300 pages from three different books."

The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents)."

Convenient access to such corpora generally requires an index, which allows one to locate individual text units (pages, sentences, lines) that are relevant to a given query (usually provided as text). Several solutions are possible: manual annotation (very expensive), handwriting recognition (poor results), and word spotting -- an image matching approach (computationally expensive). In this work, the authors present a novel retrieval approach for historical document collections that does not require recognition. They assume that word images can be described using a vocabulary of discretized word features. From a training set of labeled word images, they extract discrete feature vectors, and estimate the joint probability distribution of features and word labels. For a given feature vector (i.e., a word image), they can then calculate conditional probabilities for all labels in the training vocabulary. Experiments show that this relevance-based language model works very well with a mean average precision of 89% for 4-word queries on a subset of George Washington's manuscripts."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on off-line printed and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, which leads to a significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes."

We propose a novel approach to recognizing and retrieving handwritten manuscripts, based upon word image classification as a key step. Decision trees with normalized pixels as features form the basis of a highly accurate AdaBoost classifier, trained on a corpus of word images that have been resized and sampled at a pyramid of resolutions. To stem problems from the highly skewed distribution of class frequencies, word classes with very few training samples are augmented with stochastically altered versions of the originals. This increases recognition performance substantially. On a standard corpus of 20 pages of handwritten material from the George Washington collection the recognition performance shows a substantial improvement in performance over previous published results (75% vs 65%). Following word recognition, retrieval is done using a language model over the recognized words. Retrieval performance also shows substantially improved results over previously published results on this database. Recognition/retrieval results on a more challenging database of 100 pages from the George Washington collection are also presented."

This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

In this paper two general algorithms that have been proposed for word spotting and connected word recognition are studied. These algorithms are called the fixed range method and the local minimum method. The characteristics and properties of these algorithms are discussed. It is shown that, in several simple performance evaluations, the local minimum method performed considerably better then the fixed range method. Explanations of this behavior are given and an optimized method of applying the local minimum algorithm to word spotting and connected word recognition is described."

Unlike classical approaches found in the literature as keyword spotting or full document recognition, our approch relies on a strong and powerful global handwriting model. A entire text line is considered as an indivisible entity and is modeled with Hidden Markov Models. In this way, text line shallow parsing allows fast extraction of the relevant information in any document while rejecting at the same time irrelevant information. First results are promising and show the interest of the approach."

Bounding boxes of Chinese character images are first determined using the connected component analysis. Next, a suitable character from the user-specified word/phrase is chosen as the initial character to search for a matching candidate in the document. Once a matched candidate is found, its adjacent characters in the horizontal and vertical directions are examined for matching with other corresponding characters in the user-specified word/phrase, subject to the constraints of positional relation and size similarity. The character matching is done in two stages. The coarse matching is carried out based on the stroke density features. A weighted Hausdorff distance is proposed for the second matching phase. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively search the user-specified Chinese word/phrase from horizontal or vertical text lines of document images."

The recognition of handwriting can, however, still be considered an open research problem due to its substantial variation in appearance. With the introduction of Markovian models to the field, a promising modeling and recognition paradigm was established for automatic offline handwriting recognition. However, so far, no standard procedures for building Markov-model-based recognizers could be established though trends toward unified approaches can be identified. It is therefore the goal of this survey to provide a comprehensive overview of the application of Markov models in the research field of offline handwriting recognition, covering both the widely used hidden Markov models and the less complex Markov-chain or n-gram models. First, we will introduce the typical architecture of a Markov-model-based offline handwriting recognition system and make the reader familiar with the essential theoretical concepts behind Markovian models. Then, we will give a thorough review of the solutions proposed in the literature for the open problems how to apply Markov-model-based approaches to automatic offline handwriting recognition."

                "text": "Effective indexing is crucial for providing convenient access to scanned versions of large collections of historically valuable handwritten manuscripts. Since traditional handwriting recognizers based on optical character recognition (OCR) do not perform well on historical documents, recently a holistic word recognition approach has gained in popularity as an attractive and more straightforward solution (Lavrenko et\u00a0al. in proc. document Image Analysis for Libraries (DIAL\u201904), pp. 278\u2013287, 2004). Such techniques attempt to recognize words based on scalar and profile-based features extracted from whole word images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to holistic word recognition for historical handwritten manuscripts based on matching word contours instead of whole images or word profiles. The new method consists of robust extraction of closed word contours and the application of an elastic contour matching technique proposed originally for general shapes (Adamek and O\u2019Connor in IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 5:2004). We demonstrate that multiscale contour-based descriptors can effectively capture intrinsic word features avoiding any segmentation of words into smaller subunits. Our experiments show a recognition accuracy of 83%, which considerably exceeds the performance of other systems reported in the literature."

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

These collections are only available in image formats and require expensive manual annotation work for access to them. Current handwriting recognizers have word error rates in excess of 50% and therefore cannot be used for such material. We describe two statistical models for retrieval in large collections of handwritten manuscripts given a text query. Both use a set of transcribed page images to learn a joint probability distribution between features computed from word images and their transcriptions. The models can then be used to retrieve unlabeled images of handwritten documents given a text query. We show experiments with a training set of 100 transcribed pages and a test set of 987 handwritten page images from the George Washington collection. Experiments show that the precision at 20 documents is about 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic retrieval system for historical manuscripts using text queries, without manual transcription of the original corpus."

                "text": "Image indexing and retrieval has been an active research area for more than one decade. Although many accomplishments have been made in this domain, it is still a challenging problem and far from being solved. Traditional content-based approaches make use of queries based on image examples or image attributes like color and texture, and images are retrieved according to the similarity of each target image with the query image. However, image query based retrieval systems do not really capture the semantics or meanings of images well. Furthermore, image queries are difficult and inconvenient to form for most users. \nTo capture the semantics of images, libraries and other organizations have manually annotated each image with keywords and captions, and then search on those annotations using text retrieval engines. The disadvantage of this approach is the huge cost of annotating large number of images and the inconsistency of annotations by different people. In this work, we focus on general image and historical handwritten document retrieval based on textual queries. We explore statistical model based techniques that allow us to retrieve general images and historical handwritten document images with text queries. These techniques are (i) image retrieval based on automatic annotation, (ii) direct retrieval based on computing the posterior of an image given a text query, and (iii) handwritten document image recognition. We compare the performance of these approaches on several general image and historical handwritten document collections. The main contributions of this work include (i) two probabilistic generative models for annotation-based retrieval, (ii) a direct retrieval model for general images, and (iii) a thorough investigation of machine learning models for handwritten document recognition. Our experimental results and retrieval systems show that our proposed approaches may be applied to practical textual query based retrieval systems on large image data sets."

The model allows for arbitrary text features to be incorporated as evidence. In particular, we make use of features based on occurrences of single terms, ordered phrases, and unordered phrases. We explore full independence, sequential dependence, and full dependence variants of the model. A novel approach is developed to train the model that directly maximizes the mean average precision rather than maximizing the likelihood of the training data. Ad hoc retrieval experiments are presented on several newswire and web collections, including the GOV2 collection used at the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track. The results show significant improvements are possible by modeling dependencies, especially on the larger web collections."

The wordspotting idea has previously been proposed as a solution to creating indexes for such documents and collections by matching word images. In this paper we present an algorithm which compares whole word-images based on their appearance. This algorithm recovers correspondences of points of interest in two images, and then uses these correspondences to construct a similarity measure. This similarity measure can then be used to rank word-images in order of their closeness to a querying image. We achieved an average precision of 62.57% on a set of 2372 images of reasonable quality and an average precision of 15.49% on a set of 3262 images from documents of poor quality that are even hard to read for humans."

The documents are stored as textual images, which are compressed by constructing a library of symbols occurring in a document, and the symbols in the original image are then replaced with pointers into the codebook to obtain a compressed representation of the image. The features in wavelet and spatial domains, based on angular and distance span of shapes, are used to extract the symbols. In order to make content-based retrieval in the historical archives, a query is specified as a rectangular region in an input image and the same symbol-extraction process is applied to the query region. The queries are processed on the codebook of documents and the query images are identified in the resulting documents using the pointers in the textual images. The query process does not require decompression of images. The new content-based retrieval framework is also applicable to many other document archives using different scripts."

Well-known examples include the kernel density estimate (KDE) for density estimation and the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a \u201cdifference of densities\u201d. We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality, and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions. Simulation results for both synthetic and real-world data are presented."

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance."
