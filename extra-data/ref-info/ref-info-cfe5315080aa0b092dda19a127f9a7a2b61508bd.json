                "text": "Energy minimization is an elegant approach to computer vision. Vision problems usually have many solutions due to uncertainties in the imaging process and ambiguities in visual interpretation. The energy function encodes the problem constraints, and its minimum gives the optimal solution. Despite numerous advantages, this approach is severely limited by the high computational cost. \nThe main contribution of my thesis lies in developing efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms for several important classes of energy functions which incorporate everywhere smooth, piecewise constant, and piecewise smooth priors. These priors assume, respectively, that the quantity to be estimated varies smoothly over its domain, consist of several pieces with constant values, or consist of several pieces with smoothly varying values. The algorithms rely on graph cuts as a powerful optimization technique. \nFor a certain everywhere smooth prior we develop an algorithm which finds the exact minimum by computing a single graph cut. This method is most suitable to estimate quantities without discontinuities. But even when discontinuities exist, the method produces good results in certain cases. The running time is low order polynomial. \nFor several wide classes of piecewise smooth priors we develop two approximation algorithms (we show that exact minimization in NP-hard in these cases). These algorithms produce a local minimum in interesting large move spaces. Furthermore, one of them finds a solution within a known factor from the optimum. The algorithms are iterative and compute several graph cuts at each iteration. The running time at each iteration is effectively linear due to the special graph structure. In practice it takes just a few iterations to converge. Moreover most of the progress happens during the first iteration. \nFor a certain piecewise constant prior we adapt the algorithms developed for the piecewise smooth prior. One of them finds a solution within a factor of two from the optimum. In addition we develop a third algorithm which finds a local minimum in yet another move space. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo, and motion. For the data with ground truth, our methods significantly outperform standard methods."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

One of the simplest ways to do this is to use the silhouettes of the object (the binary classification of images into object and background) to construct a bounding volume for the object. To efficiently represent this volume, we use an octree, which represents the object as a tree of recursively subdivided cubes. We develop a new algorithm for computing the octree bounding volume from multiple silhouettes and apply it to an object rotating on a turntable in front of a stationary camera. The algorithm performs a limited amount of processing for each viewpoint and incrementally builds the volumetric model. The resulting algorithm requires less total computation than previous algorithms, runs in close to real-time, and builds a model whose resolution improves over time."

An iterative algorithm is used to find the scene model which jointly explains all the observed images by determining which region of space is responsible for each of the observations. The current approach formulates the problem as one of optimization over estimates of these responsibilities. The process converges to a distribution of responsibility which accurately reflects the constraints provided by the observations, the positions and shape of both solid and transparent objects, and the uncertainty which remains. Reconstruction is robust, and gracefully represents regions of space in which there is little certainty about the exact structure due to limited, non-existent, or contradicting data. Rendered images of voxel spaces recovered from synthetic and real observation images are shown."

In general, identifying a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach; it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms. The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and curved patches. >"

A smooth convex shape can be estimated instantaneously from its contour and by the first derivative of contour movement (trace of contour, or contour distribution with time). We also analyze shapes that do not satisfy the conditions of smoothness and visibility, which are indispensable for modeling an object. A region that does not expose as contour yields a nonsmoothness in the tracked contour movement. We can thus detect such a region by contour distribution filtering and extract its accurate location by computing the left and right derivatives of the distribution. This has not been studied previously. These unknown regions are obtained for further investigation using other visual cues. A general approach for building a geometrical object model using contours is then described. The entire process from silhouettes to a 3-D model is based local computation; this is promising for producing shapes in real time. Our direct goal is to establish 3-D graphics models of human faces for the growing needs of visual communications. We have obtained some good results. >"

The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene, fully consistent with the input images. The approach is evaluated with images from both inward-facing and outward-facing cameras."

Image-based stereo is used to compute a range image corresponding to each intensity image in each video stream. Each range and intensity image pair encodes the scene structure and appearance of the scene visible to the camera at that moment, and is therefore called a visible surface model (VSM). A single time instant of the dynamic event can be modeled as a collection of VSMs from different viewpoints, and the full event can be modeled as a sequence of static scenes-the 3D equivalent of video. Alternatively, the collection of VSMs at a single time can be fused into a global 3D surface model, thus creating a traditional virtual representation out of real world events. Global modeling has the added benefit of eliminating the need to hand-edit the range images to correct errors made in stereo, a drawback of previous techniques. Like image-based rendering models, these virtual representations can be used to synthesize nearly any view of the virtualized event. For this reason, the paper includes a detailed comparison of existing view synthesis techniques with the authors' own approach. In the virtualized representations, however, scene structure is explicitly represented and therefore easily manipulated, for example by adding virtual objects to (or removing virtualized objects from) the model without interfering with real event. Virtualized reality, then, is a platform not only for image-based rendering but also for 3D scene manipulation."

Image-based stereo is used to compute a range image corresponding to each intensity image in each video stream. Each range and intensity image pair encodes the scene structure and appearance of the scene visible to the camera at that moment, and is therefore called a visible surface model (VSM). A single time instant of the dynamic event can be modeled as a collection of VSMs from different viewpoints, and the full event can be modeled as a sequence of static scenes-the 3D equivalent of video. Alternatively, the collection of VSMs at a single time can be fused into a global 3D surface model, thus creating a traditional virtual representation out of real world events. Global modeling has the added benefit of eliminating the need to hand-edit the range images to correct errors made in stereo, a drawback of previous techniques. Like image-based rendering models, these virtual representations can be used to synthesize nearly any view of the virtualized event. For this reason, the paper includes a detailed comparison of existing view synthesis techniques with the authors' own approach. In the virtualized representations, however, scene structure is explicitly represented and therefore easily manipulated, for example by adding virtual objects to (or removing virtualized objects from) the model without interfering with real event. Virtualized reality, then, is a platform not only for image-based rendering but also for 3D scene manipulation."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."
