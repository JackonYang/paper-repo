In order to improve this document input system's performance, an appropriate document structure analysis technique is indispen~able(''~'). When storing data from general printed documents into a database, it is necessary to represent the document structure. Therefore, a document layout structure generation method is especially important(*)(6). For this purpose, the authors have developed a document image structure analysis method to generate a layout structure, as well as to detect such document elements as characters, pictures and figures. This method was developed on a personal computer. Its usability is described in this paper."

Out of all the functions required for the entire process from document scanning through recognition, these have been investigated and implemented: skew detection and correction, region (block) segmentation, and mathematical expression recognition. The algorithms have been designed for high speed as much as possible. This experimental system is implemented entirely in software on a work station under X-windows.

                "text": "This paper presents an efficient and powerful character segmentation method which enables touching characters in a document to be read accurately at high speed. The character segmentation phase extracts characters from a text line. Connected components in a text line image may have to be segmented or combined to form recognizable characters. For example, the character \u2018i\u2019 is formed by combining two components. Touching characters are segmented to identify each character. Segmenting touching characters is an open problem, whose solution would advance the field. Touching characters have several candidates for their break position, which are then confirmed by recursive segmentation and recognition, and finally by the determination of the linguistic context. There are several possible candidates at each stage. For example, several candidates for the break position of touching characters are nominated. Any segmented area might possibly fit several alternative characters. Therefore, an efficient resolution of ambiguity at each stage is significantly critical and indispensable for practical text reading. The authors\u2019 approach is based on knowledge about character composition (e.g. an \u2018m\u2019 is like a combination of an \u2018r\u2019 and an \u2018n\u2019), as well as knowledge about omni-fonts. Knowledge about character composition compresses the number of recursive segmentation and recognition."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

We have attempted to uncouple sources of variation in the input - irnaging defects, page layouts, sizes of text, symbol sets, font styles, linguistic contexts, and transliteration encodings - so that each can be managed by an independent subsystem. In pursuit of this goal, new algorithms have been required. For example. page layout analysis is virtually language-independent due to the use of a global-to-local strategy; but this demanded unusually fast and accurate algorithms for skew- and shear-correction and for analysis of the structure of white space. To permit arbitrary combinations of symbol sets, font styles, and image defect distributions for specialized classifiers, we developed a hybrid structuraVstatistica1 recognition technology, trained by examples generated by a pseudo-random image defect model. Character segmentation is driven by classifier confidence scores, with the result that language-specific rules are rarely needed. Linguistic context, such as provided by dictionaries, is exploited by a series of data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner."

Although carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching, and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from what was achievable through shape analysis alone.

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"
