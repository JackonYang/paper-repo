Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent. It is a substantial contribution to Machine Learning technology."

Although query execution is slower than if the invariances were successfully pre-compiled during training, there are significant advantages in several contexts: (i) providing invariances in memory-based learning, (ii) in model selection, where reducing training time at the expense of test time is a desirable trade-off, and (iii) in enabling robust, ad hoc searches based on a single example. Preliminary tests for memory-based learning on the NIST handwritten digit database with a limited set of shearing and translation distortions produced an error rate of 1.35%."

We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

The fact that it is the margin, or confidence level, of a classification--that is, a scale parameter--rather than a raw training error that matters has become a key tool for dealing with classifiers. This book shows how this idea applies to both the theoretical analysis and the design of algorithms. \nThe book provides an overview of recent developments in large margin classifiers, examines connections with other methods (e.g., Bayesian inference), and identifies strengths and weaknesses of the method, as well as directions for future research. Among the contributors are Manfred Opper, Vladimir Vapnik, and Grace Wahba."

Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm."

Local learning algorithms attempt to locally adjust the capacity of the training system to the properties of the training set in each area of the input space. The family of local learning algorithms contains known methods, like the k-nearest neighbors method (kNN) or the radial basis function networks (RBF), as well as new algorithms. A single analysis models some aspects of these algorithms. In particular, it suggests that neither kNN or RBF, nor nonlocal classifiers, achieve the best compromise between locality and capacity. A careful control of these parameters in a simple local learning algorithm has provided a performance breakthrough for an optical character recognition problem. Both the error rate and the rejection performance have been significantly improved."

Vapnik (1995) and a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (Chen, 1995; Chen, Donoho, & Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique that can be derived from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless, the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem. In the appendix, we present a derivation of the SVM technique in the framework of regularization theory, rather than statistical learning theory, establishing a connection between SVM, sparse approximation, and regularization theory."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

These points are called translation initiation sites (TIS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe task of finding TIS can be modeled as a classification problem. We demonstrate the applicability of support vector machines for this task, and show how to incorporate prior biological knowledge by engineering an appropriate kernel function. With the described techniques the recognition performance can be improved by 26% over leading existing approaches. We provide evidence that existing related methods (e.g. ESTScan) could profit from advanced TIS recognition."

Linear transformations can be learned exactly from a small set of examples in the case of \"linear object classes\" and used to produce new views of an object from a single view."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

We describe the development of JARtool, a trainable software system that learns to recognize volcanoes in a large data set of Venusian imagery. A machine learning approach is used because it is much easier for geologists to identify examples of volcanoes in the imagery than it is to specify domain knowledge as a set of pixel-level constraints. This approach can also provide portability to other domains without the need for explicit reprogramming; the user simply supplies the system with a new set of training examples. We show how the development of such a system requires a completely different set of skills than are required for applying machine learning to \u201ctoy world\u201d domains. This paper discusses important aspects of the application process not commonly encountered in the \u201ctoy world,\u201d including obtaining labeled training data, the difficulties of working with pixel data, and the automatic extraction of higher-level features."

Establishing the essential properties of such models, such as completeness (expressive power) and calibration (closeness of fit to actual image populations) remain open research problems. Work-in-progress towards a parameterized model of local imaging defects is described, together with a variety of motivating theoretical arguments and empirical evidence. A pseudo-random image generator implementing the model has been built. Applications of the generator are described, including a polyfont classifier for ASCII and a single-font classifier for a large alphabet (Tibetan U-Chen), both of which which were constructed with a minimum of manual effort. Image defect models and their associated generators permit a new kind of image database which is explicitly parameterized and indefinitely extensible, alleviating some drawbacks of existing databases."
