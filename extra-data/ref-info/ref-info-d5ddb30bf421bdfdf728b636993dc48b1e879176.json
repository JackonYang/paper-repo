This dissertation focuses on one type of PDP model, networks of simple processing units trained by the back propagation algorithm to learn input-output relationships. Two areas of inquiry are investigated: cognitive development, and representation of linguistic regularities, associations, such as those governing constraints on word-combinations. \nIn Part I, artificial training corpora are constructed to explore how constraints on the order of acquisition of different types of information may be a function of the learning algorithm and superpositional storage of input-output pairs. The principles that constrain network performance are compared to three complimentary approaches to development: maturational, constructivist, and correlational. The exploratory models show that PDP mechanisms are relevant to all three approaches. Networks can be used to illustrate the notions of logical prerequisite and critical period, and can recover from initial incorrect encodings of a training corpus, such as those that derive from imperfect correlations between aspects of the input and output. These findings are argued to be relevant to the question of what computational mechanisms and representations may facilitate inductive learning. \nPart II of the dissertation focuses on the potential of PDP models to capture linguistic regularities. To investigate an analogy between network and human representations of word meaning and word-combination rules, the polysemic structure of six prepositions were analyzed. Two PDP models meeting some of these representational challenges were constructed. The training sets for both models consist of distributions of form-meaning pairs that reflect important aspects of English spatial expressions. Under pressure to encode these distributional regularities with limited resources, the models self-organize to encode the abstract properties of the input vectors and \"rules\" for their combination. Key to the models' successful integration of words in different contexts is their recoding of input vectors into a format in which co-occurrence relationships among words are explicit. Given that speakers must solve the same problem solved by the networks, human mental representations of word meanings may also conflate attributes of individual words and the contexts in which they occur."

Several aspects of cognitive development might result from the process of learning as it occurs in multi-layer networks. This learning process has the characteristic that it reduces the discrepancy between expected and observed events. As it does this, representations develop on hidden units which dramatically change both the way in which the network represents the environment from which it learns and the expectations that the network generates about environmental events. The learning process exhibits relatively abrupt transitions corresponding to stage shifts in cognitive development. These points are illustrated using a network that learns to anticipate which side of a balance beam will go down, based on the number of weights on each side of the fulcrum and their distance from the fulcrum on each side of the beam. The network is trained in an environment in which weight more frequently governs which side will go down. It recapitulates the states of development seen in children, as well as the stage transitions, as it learns to represent weight and distance information.

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-1, together with element t, to predict element t+1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses performed at different points during training."

According to our view, limitations, particularly of the sensory systems, produce adaptive advantages for infants by facilitating perceptual organization. During embryogenesis, developmental rates of sensory systems are unequal so that onset of functioning is sequential. We argue that such differential onset results in relative independence among emerging systems, thereby reducing competition which helps regulate subsequent neurogenesis and functioning. In addition to prenatal effects, neonatal sensory limitations are discussed as a major source of perceptual organization. Limitations reduce the amount of information with which the infant must contend and promote temporal contiguity between multimodal attributes of a stimulus. Although we focus on human perceptual development, our view is a broadly based comparative one. Thus, other organisms have evolved means of restricting sensory input, and evidence is cited suggesting the importance of this reduced input in regulating normal perceptual development."

Yet, despite its importance, research into the problems of language learnability has rarely gone beyond the informal, commonsense intuitions that currently prevail among linguists and psychologists.By focusing their inquiry on formal language learnability theory--the interface of formal mathematical linguistics, linguistic theory and cognitive psychology--the authors of this book have developed a rigorous and unified theory that opens the study of language learnability to discoveries about the mechanisms of language acquisition in human beings. Their research has important implications for linguistic theory, child language research, and the philosophy of language.\"Formal Principles of Language Acquisition\" develops rigorous mathematical methods for demonstrating the learnability of classes of grammars. It adapts the well-developed theories of transformational grammar to establish psychological motivation for a set of formal constraints on grammars sufficient for learnability. In addition, the research deals with such matters as the complex interaction between the mechanism of language learning and the learning environment, the empirical adequacy of the learnability constraints, feasibility and attainability of classes of grammars, the role of semantics in language learnability, and the adequacy of transformational grammars as models of human linguistic competence.This first serious and extended development of a formal and precise theory of language learnability will interest researchers in psychology and linguistics, and is recommended for use in graduate courses in language acquisition, linguistic theory, psycholinguistics, and mathematical linguistics, as well as interdisciplinary courses that deal with language learning, use, and philosophy.Contents: Methodological Considerations; Foundations of a Theory of Learnability; A Learnability Result for Transformational Grammar; Degree-2 Learnability; Linguistic Evidence for the Learnability Constraints; Function, Performance and Explanations; Further Issues: Linguistic Interaction, Invariance Principle, Open Problems; Notes, Bibliography, Index."

Subjects were placed in a simulated scientific discovery context by first teaching them how to use an electronic device and then asking them to discover how a hitherto unencountered function worked. To do this task, subjects had to formulate hypotheses based on their prior knowledge, conduct experiments, and evaluate the results of their experiments. These studies provided support for the view that scientific reasoning is a search in two problem spaces. By extending Simon and Lea's (1974) Generalized Rule Inducer, we present a general model of Scientific Discovery as Dual Search (SDDS) that shows how search in two problem spaces (an hypothesis space and an experimental space) shapes hypothesis generation, experimental design, and the evaluation of hypotheses. The model also shows how these processes interact with each other and suggests what their developmental course might be.

Instead of just adjusting the weights in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a minimal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors. The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages over existing algorithms: it learns very quickly, the network determines its own size and topology, it retains the structures it has built even if the training set changes, and it requires no back-propagation of error signals through the connections of the network."

A context theory of classificatio n is described in which judgments are assumed to derive exclusively from stored exemplar information. The main idea is that a probe item acts as a retrieval cue to access information associated with stimuli similar to the probe. The predictions of the context theory are contrasted with those of a class of theories (including prototype theory) that assume that the information entering into judgments can be derived from an additive combination of information from component cue dimensions. Across four experiments using both geometric forms and schematic faces as stimuli, the context theory consistently gave a better account of the data. The relation of the context theory to other theories and phenomena associated with ill-defined concepts is discussed in detail. One of the major components of cognitive behavior concerns abstracting rules and forming concepts. Our entire system of naming objects and events, talking about them, and interacting with them presupposes the ability to group experiences into appropriate classes. Young children learn to tell the difference between dogs and cats, between clocks and fans, and between stars and street lights. Since few concepts are formally taught, the evolution of concepts from experience with exemplars must be a fundamental learning phenomenon. The focus of the present article is to explore how such conceptual achievements emerge from individual instances."

A novel method called dynamic node creation (DNC) that attacks issues of training large networks and of testing networks with different numbers of hidden layer units is presented. DNC sequentially adds nodes one at a time to the hidden layer(s) of the network until the desired approximation accuracy is achieved. Simulation results for parity, symmetry, binary addition, and the encoder problem are presented. The procedure was capable of finding known minimal topologies in many cases, and was always within three nodes of the minimum. Computational expense for finding the solutions was comparable to training normal backpropagation (BP) networks with the same final topologies. Starting out with fewer nodes than needed to solve the problem actually seems to help find a solution. The method yielded a solution for every problem tried. BP applied to the same large networks with randomized initial weights was unable, after repeated attempts, to replicate some minimum solutions found by DNC.<<ETX>>"

A habituation-test procedure was used throughout. At each age subjects were repeatedly shown a three-dimensional model of a human head until a criterion of habituation of looking was reached. Relative to the habituation condition, the standard test condition was either the same (control) or different in distance, size, or both size and distance. Appropriate comparisons between the recovery scores for the test conditions showed that at 6 and 8 months, size constancy occurred for the head model up to a distance of 70 cm.

Types of parent-young contact (huddling or squatting) and social interaction (body nosing and accompanying behaviors) are described and their ontogenetic trends examined between postnatal Days 1 and 46. Fathers spent less time than mothers in contact with the young. Mother-young contact decreased postnatally, whereas the amounts of mother-young and father-young social interaction, measured in terms of body-nosing exchanges, showed a continuous increase postnatally; sibling interactions also showed a continuous increase. Father-young interactions tended to be dominated by the father. Young reared with the father cohabiting huddled less with their mother, and engaged in less body-nosing, than young reared in the father's absence. Observations suggested that paternal control of the young may curb juvenile interactions. Young observed without their parents in an unfamiliar enclosure did not groom or \"play\" as in their home cage with parents present, but engaged in relatively more vocalizing, neck-nosing and forepaw-clasping."
