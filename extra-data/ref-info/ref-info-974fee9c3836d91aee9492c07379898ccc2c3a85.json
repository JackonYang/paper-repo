Beliefpropagation(BP)wasonlysupposedtowork for tree-likenetworksbutworks surprisinglywell in many applicationsinvolving networkswith loops,includingturbo codes.However, therehasbeenlittle understandingof thealgorithmor thenatureof thesolutionsit findsfor generalgraphs. We show that BP canonly converge to a stationarypoint of an approximatefree energy, known astheBethefreeenergy in statisticalphysics.This resultcharacterizes BP fixed-pointsand makes connectionswith variationalapproachesto approximate inference. More importantly, our analysislets us build on the progressmadein statistical physicssinceBethe\u2019 s approximationwasintroducedin 1935.Kikuchi andothershave shown how to constructmoreaccuratefree energy approximations,of which Bethe\u2019 s approximationis the simplest. Exploiting the insightsfrom our analysis,we derive generalizedbeliefpropagation(GBP)versionsof theseKikuchi approximations. These new messagepassingalgorithmscanbesignificantlymoreaccuratethanordinaryBP, at anadjustableincreasein complexity. We illustratesucha new GBPalgorithmon a grid Markov network andshow thatit givesmuchmoreaccuratemarginalprobabilities thanthosefoundusingordinaryBP.

This procedure can be applied to almost any optimization problem, and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of it. In particular, we prove that all expectation-maximization algorithms and classes of Legendre minimization and variational bounding algorithms can be reexpressed in terms of CCCP. We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory algorithms are also examples of CCCP. The generalized iterative scaling algorithm and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables. CCCP can be used both as a new way to understand, and prove the convergence of, existing optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

In this thesis, we focus upon the assignment problem and construct several provably convergent, interrelated iterative and continuous flows for finding the optimal assignment. \nWe begin by using statistical physics techniques to motivate the derivation of a general effective energy function for suspending combinatorial problems. This effective energy form may be compared with standard barrier function approaches to non-linear programming. \nFor the special case of the assignment problem, the optimal solution can always be recovered from a minimum of the effective energy and rigorous convergence bounds can be proved. Interestingly, in the zero temperature limit, extremized versions of the effective energy function reduce to standard formulations of the primal and dual linear programming problems. \nA number of different iterative and continuous algorithms may be used to minimize the effective energy and solve the assignment problem, including steepest descent and a temperature tracking method. Sinkhorn's classical iterative matrix algorithm for finding doubly stochastic matrix is shown to be equivalent to minimizing the effective energy. Moreover, our effective energy results may be used to derive a generalized version of Sinkhorn's method and to construct candidate continuous suspensions."

Although experimental results strongly support the efficacy of turbo codes, further theoretical analysis is necessary, which is not straightforward. It is pointed out that the iterative decoding algorithm of turbo codes shares essentially similar ideas with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, with Pearl's belief propagation algorithm applied to a cyclic belief diagram, and with the Bethe approximation in statistical physics. Therefore, the analysis of the turbo decoding algorithm will reveal the mystery of those similar iterative methods. In this paper, we recapture and extend the geometrical framework initiated by Richardson to the information geometrical framework of dual affine connections, focusing on both of the turbo and LDPC decoding algorithms. The framework helps our intuitive understanding of the algorithms and opens a new prospect of further analysis. We reveal some properties of these codes in the proposed framework, including the stability and error analysis. Based on the error analysis, we finally propose a correction term for improving the approximation."

                "text": "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

Although these algorithms have been shown experimentally to be successful there has been little theoretical analysis of them. In this paper we demonstrate connections between mean field theory methods and other approaches, in particular, barrier function and interior point methods. As an explicit example, we summarize our work on the linear assignment problem. In this previous work we defined a number of algorithms, including deterministic annealing, for solving the assignment problem. We proved convergence, gave bounds on the convergence times, and showed relations to other optimization algorithms."

The analysis of articulated motion is challenging because of the potentially large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) of an articulated body. For particle filter based algorithms, the number of samples required with high dimensional problems can be computationally prohibitive. To alleviate this problem, we represent the articulated object as an undirected graphical model (or Markov random field, MRF) in which soft constraints between adjacent subparts are captured by conditional probability distributions. The graphical model is extended across time frames to implement a tracker. The tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a belief inference procedure on a dynamic Bayesian network. The discretisation of the state vectors makes it possible to utilise the efficient belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF) algorithms to reason in this network. Experiments on real video sequences demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and performs well in tracking the human body."

This architecture is constructed by combining the following techniques: (1) deterministic annealing, (2) self-amplification, (3) algebraic transformations, (4) clocked objectives, and (5) softassign. Deterministic annealing in conjunction with self-amplification avoids poor local minima and ensures that a vertex of the hypercube is reached. Algebraic transformations and clocked objectives help partition the relaxation into distinct phases. The problems considered have doubly stochastic matrix constraints or minor variations thereof. We introduce a new technique, softassign, which is used to satisfy this constraint. Experimental results on different problems are presented and discussed."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

We generate a synthetic world of scenes and their corresponding rendered images, modeling their relationships with a Markov network. Bayesian belief propagation allows us to efficiently find a local maximum of the posterior probability for the scene, given an image. We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound."

For networks storing a finite number of patterns, we present bifurcation diagrams for the pattern overlaps. For networks storing an extensive number of patterns, we present phase diagrams showing attractor types as a function of pattern-storage fraction and neuron-transfer-function steepness. We also report results for the storage capacity of k-winner associative memories in the limit of infinite neuron gain. Numerical investigations of computer-generated networks confirm the phase diagrams."
