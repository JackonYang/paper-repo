It is shown that for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations. Three alternative methods of determining the transformation that matches a model to a given image are proposed. >"

First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

Each layer contains an intensity map that defines the additive values of each pixel, along with an alpha map that serves as a mask indicating the transparency. The layers are ordered in depth and they occlude each other in accord with the rules of compositing. Velocity maps define how the layers are to be warped over time. The layered representation is more flexible than standard image transforms and can capture many important properties of natural image sequences. We describe some methods for decomposing image sequences into layers using motion analysis, and we discuss how the representation may be used for image coding and other applications."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

One way to address this question is to explore the ability of the human visual system to generalize recognition from familiar to unfamiliar views of three-dimensional objects. Three recently proposed theories of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional models [Ullman, S. (1989) Cognition 32, 193-254], linear combination of two-dimensional views [Ullman, S. & Basri, R. (1990) Recognition by Linear Combinations of Models (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge), A. I. Memo No. 1152], and view approximation [Poggio, T. & Edelman, S. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 263-266]--predict different patterns of generalization to unfamiliar views. We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models."

The trilinearity result is shown to be of much practical use in visual recognition by alignment-yielding a direct reprojection method that cuts through the computations of camera transformation, scene structure and epipolar geometry. Moreover, the direct method is linear and sets a new lower theoretical bound on the minimal number of points that are required for a linear solution for the task of reprojection. The proof of the central result may be of further interest as it demonstrates certain regularities across homographics of the plane and introduces new view invariants. Experiments on simulated and real image data were conducted, including a comparative analysis with epipolar intersection and the linear combination methods, with results indicating a greater degree of robustness in practice and a higher level of performance in reprojection tasks. >"

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization theory. A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks or hyper basis functions. These networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines but are also closely related to the classical radial basis functions used for interpolation tasks and to several pattern recognition and neural network algorithms.

This suggests that the representation of shape in the brain is abstract and very unlike that used in conscious thought. Here we explore the proposal that this representation is matched to the statistical properties of objects in the environment. From an ensemble of several hundred laser-scanned three-dimensional (3D) human heads we extract the principal components which provide a compact basis for head shape. We show that, with good accuracy, a given head can be represented by linear combinations of a few dozen primary shapes just as colours can be synthesized by combining the three principal colours. We suggest new perceptual adaptation experiments for testing the brain's shape representation system. The principal head shapes can also be used to probe response properties of 'face-cells' in the inferior temporal cortex."

Techniques from statistical physics, which can be interpreted as computing marginal probability distributions, are then used to analyze these models and are shown to (1) relate them to existing theories and (2) give insight into the relations between, and relative effectivenesses of, existing theories. In particular we exploit the power of statistical techniques to put global constraints on the set of allowable states of the binary matching elements. The binary elements can then be removed analytically before minimization. This is demonstrated to be preferable to existing methods of imposing such constraints by adding bias terms in the energy functions. We give applications to winner-take-all networks, correspondence for stereo and long-range motion, the traveling salesman problem, deformable template matching, learning, content addressable memories, and models of brain development. The biological plausibility of these networks is briefly discussed."

                "text": "We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes that are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called regularization networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term generalized regularization networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call generalized regularization networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are (1) radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions, and several perceptron-like neural networks with one hidden layer."

Since its formation, in 1947, the Association has adhered to the originally established policy of informality. That is, meetings and discussions were encouraged and information was generally put out in mimeographed form and more formal publications were discouraged. The function of the organization was to maintain a mailing list of members paying only such dues as were necessary to cover the cost of printing or mimeographing and mailing. Such an organization served its purpose excellently, but times have changed.\nPrior to the formation of the Association, the automatic computing field, as such, hardly existed. Probably the first meeting of those interested in the field was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945. The occasion was to introduce the differential analyzer, designed by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Dr. Samuel H. Caldwell, to the public. This machine is a refinement of the original machine built by Dr. Bush in 1925. The earlier machine served as a pattern for several machines which were in operation in 1945, including those at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, the General Electric Company and in Manchester, England.\nIt is interesting to note that, at the time of this first meeting, other analog type machines were in operation. Network analyzers were employed to simulate power distribution systems and aid in their study. None of these machines employed digital representation but represented the values in analog form, such as voltage, current or angular position. Digital computation was possible only by hand operated calculators or by some business machines.\n Although automatic digital computation by machinery was the goal Charles Babbage strove to reach, it was not until the Hollerith rotary counter was suggested in 1890 and the International Business Machines Corporation began producing machines employing such counters for accounting purposes in the period from 1903 to 1905, that such goal was reached. The automatic multiplying punch machine was not produced until 1931.\nComputation by means of telephone relays was first introduced in the Bell System Complex Computer, known as Model I, in 1939. The method of employing the relays was suggested by Dr. George R. Stibitz and the machine was designed by Samuel B. Williams. This was not a fully automatic machine.
