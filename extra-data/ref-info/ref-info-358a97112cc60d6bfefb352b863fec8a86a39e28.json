Measures of match which are suitable for this purpose are discussed, as are methods for pruning the search for a match. The mathematics necessary to convert a set of matchings into a workable camera model are given, along with calculations which use this model and a pair of image points to locate the corresponding scene point. Methods are included to detect some types of unmatchable target areas in the original data and for detecting when a supposed match is invalid. Region growing techniques are di9 for extend matching areas into regions of constant parallax and for delimiting uniform regions in an image. Also, two algorithms are presented to show some of the ways in which these techniques can be combined to perform useful tasks in the processing of stereo images."

The visual input is provided by a TV-camera, and the problem is to interpret that input by computer, as a projection of a three-dimensional scene. The system proposed and demonstrated in this paper uses perspectively consistent two-dimensional models (prototypes) of views of three-dimensional objects, and interpretations of scene-representations are based on the establishment of mapping relationships from conglomerates of scene-elements (line-constellations) to prototypes templates. The prototypes are learned by the program through analysis of - and generalization on - ideal instances."

VV uses a model of a scene to locate objects of interest in a picture of the scene. The characteristics that distinguish VV from the other types of visual information processing are: (1) the system has a great deal of prior knowledge about the type, placement, and appearance of the objects that form the scene and (2) the goal is to verify and refine the location of one or more objects in the scene. VV includes a significant portion of the visual feedback tasks required within programmable assembly. For example, locating a screw hole and determining the relative displacement between a screw hole are both VV tasks. There are several types of information available in VV tasks that can facilitiate the solution of such tasks: a model of each object in the scene, a set of initial constraints on the locations of the objects, and a set of previous pictures of this scene or similar scenes. Additional information can be obtained by applying visual operators to a current picture of the scene."

The research is concerned with specific problems that arise in processing aerial photographs for such military applications as cartography, intelligence, weapon guidance, and targeting. A key concept is the use of a generalized digital map to guide the process of image analysis. In the present phase of our program, the primary focus is on developing a 'road expert,' whose purpose is to monitor and interpret road events in aerial imagery. The objectives, methodology, and current status of our research are described in this report. Particular technical topics include data base construction and shadow and anomaly analysis."

The pictures are first geometrically normalized to a common point of view. Then they are photometrically normalized to eliminate the differences due to different illumination, camera characteristics, and reflectance properties of the scene due to different sun and view angles. These pictures are then geometrically registered by maximizing the cross correlation between areas in them. The final normalized and registered pictures are then differenced point by point."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

Rib images contribute false positives in tumor-detection algorithms. Hence detecting the rib contours should facilitate removal of these lalse posltives. 2. The ribs provide a frame of reference for the description and location of lesions within the thoracic cavity. 3. The envelope of the ribs provides a more accurate basis for computing the boundary of the chest cavity (referred to as the \"lung boundary\" In other papers) than other known techniques. \n \nOur algorithm consists of a) high-pass filtering of the digitized picture, b) local \"edge\" detection by a combination of thresholding, Laplacian, and gradient operators, c) selection of edge elements in accordance with their angular orientation, d) matching straight line segments and conic sections to the selected edge elements, e) constructing strips centered on the straight line segments and conic sections, and f) heuristic search within these strips."

The utility function of decision theory is used to reveal tradeoffs among competing strategies for achieving various goals, taking into account such factors as reliability, the complexity of steps in the strategy, and the value of the goal. The utility function on strategies can therefore be used as a guide when searching for good strategies. It is also used to formulate solutions to the problems of how to acquire a world model, how much planning effort is worthwhile, and whether verification tests should be performed. These techniques are illustrated by application to the classic monkey and bananas problem."
