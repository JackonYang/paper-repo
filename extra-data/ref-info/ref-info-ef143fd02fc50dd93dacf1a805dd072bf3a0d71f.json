Two new segmentation algorithms using feature extraction techniques are presented; both are intended for use in the recognition of machine-printed lines of 10-, 11- and 12-pitch serif-type multifont characters. One of the methods, called quasi-topological segmentation, bases the decision to \u201csection\u201d a character on a combination of feature-extraction and character-width measurements. The other method, topological segmentation, involves feature extraction alone. The algorithms have been tested with an evaluation method that is independent of any particular recognition system. Test results are based on application of the algorithm to upper-case alphanumeric characters gathered from print sources that represent the existing world of machine printing. The topological approach demonstrated better performance on the test data than did the quasi-topological approach."

A novel approach that performs OCR without the segmentation step was developed. The approach starts by extracting significant geometric features from the input document image of the page. Each feature then votes for the character that could have generated that feature. Thus, even if some of the features are occluded or lost due to degradation, the remaining features can successfully identify the character. In extreme cases, the degradation may be severe enough to prevent recognition of some of the characters in a word. In such cases, a lexicon-based word recognition technique is used to resolve ambiguity. Inexact matching and probabilistic evaluation used in the technique make it possible to identify the correct word, by detecting a partial set of characters. The authors first present an overview of their segmentation-free OCR system and then focus on the word recognition technique. Preliminary experimental results show that this is a very promising approach.<<ETX>>"

In the system, each subgraph of features that matches a previously defined character prototype is recognized anywhere in the word even if it corresponds to a broken character or to a character touching another one. The characters are detected in the order defined by the matching quality. Each subgraph that is recognized is introduced as a node in a direct net that compiles different alternatives of interpretation of the features in the feature graph. A path in the net represents a consistent succession of characters in the word. The method allows the recognition of characters that overlap, or that are underlined. A final search for the optimal path under certain criteria gives the best interpretation of the word features. The character recognizer uses a flexible matching between the features and a flexible grouping of the individual features to be matched. Broken characters are recognized by looking for gaps between features that may be interpreted as part of a character. Touching characters are recognized because the matching allows non-matched adjacent features. The recognition results of this system on over 4,000 printed numeral characters belonging to a USPS database and on some hand printed words confirmed the method's high robustness level."

The usefulness of 'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

Initial hypotheses for the identities of words are then generated by matching the word groups to language statistics that predict the frequency at which certain words will occur. This is followed by a recognition step that assigns identifications to the images in the clusters. This paper concentrates on the clustering algorithm. A clustering technique is presented and its performance on a running text of 1062 word images is determined. It is shown that the clustering algorithm can correctly locate groups of short function words with better than a 95 percent correct rate.<<ETX>>"

The weakest link is its handling of characters which are difficult to segment. The engine is divided into four phases: segmentation, image recognition, ambiguity resolution, and document analysis. The features are zonal and reduce the image to a blurred, gray-level representation. The classifier is data-driven, trained offline, and model-free. Handcrafted features and decision trees tend to be brittle in the presence of noise. To satisfy the needs of full-text applications, the system captures the structure of the document so that, when viewed in a word processor or spreadsheet program, the formatting of the optically recognized document reflects that of the original document. To satisfy the needs of the forms market, a proofing and correction tool displays 'pop-up' images of uncertain characters. >"

This paper proposes a hybrid method which combines a neural network-based de ferred segmentation scheme with conventional immediate segmentation techniques. In the deferred segmentation, a neural network is employed to distinguish single characters from composites. To find a proper vertical cut that separates a composite, a shortest-path alg~ rithm seeking minimal-penalty curved cuts is used. Integrating those components with a multiresolution neural network OCR and an efficient spelling checker, the resulting system significantly improves its ability to read omnifont document text."

Here, this technique is applied to the problem of recognizing cursive script. The parameters used in the matching are derived from time sequences of x-y coordinate data of words handwritten on an electronic tablet. Chosen for their properties of invariance with respect to size and translation of the writing, these parameters are found particularly suitable for the elastic matching technique. A salient feature of the recognition system is the establishment, in a training procedure, of prototypes by each writer using the system. In this manner, the system is tailored to the user. Processing is performed on a word-by-word basis after the writing is separated into words. Using prototypes for each letter, the matching procedure allows any letter to follow any letter and finds the letter sequence which best fits the unknown word. A major advantage of this procedure is that it combines letter segmentation and recognition in one operation by, in essence, evaluating recognition at all possible segmentations, thus avoiding the usual segmentation-then-recognition philosophy. Results on cursive writing are presented where the alphabet is restricted to the lower-case letters. Letter recognition accuracy is over 95 percent for each of three writers."

We introduce a new method for segmenting words into letters, based on minimizing a cost function. Segmented letters are normalized with a novel algorithm that scales different parts of a letter separately removing much of the variation in the writing. We use a neural network for letter recognition and use the output of the network as posterior probabilities of letters in the word recognition process. We found that using a hidden Markov Model for word recognition is less successful than assuming an independent process for our small set of test words. In our experiments with several hundred words, written by 7 writers, 96% of the test words were correctly segmented, 52% were correctly recognized, and 70% were in the top three choices.<<ETX>>"

The former runs a statistical linear classifier, and the latter runs a neural network with a different representation of the input data. The testing, comparison, and combination studies have been performed on word images from mail provided by the USPS.

A ranking combination strategy is applied to produce a consensus ranking. The proposed method was applied to a test set of 827 images scanned on a postal OCR, with a lexicon of 186 words. A 96% correct rate within the top 10 choices was achieved."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

It is a critical step because incorrectly segmented characters are not likely to be correctly recognized. The most difficult cases in character segmentation are broken characters and touching characters. The problem of segmenting touching characters in various fonts and size in machine-printed text is addressed. The author classifies the touching characters into five categories: touching characters in fixed-pitch fonts, proportional and serif fonts, ambiguous touching characters, and strings with broken and touching characters. Different methods for detecting multiple character segments and for segmenting touching characters in these categories are developed. The methods use features of characters and fonts and profile models.<<ETX>>"

An accurate channel model that allows for splitting, merging, and substitution of symbols is introduced.

The computational complexity of the algorithm is derived and compared with that of a method based on the generalized Levenshtein metric. Experimental results with the algorithm on English text based on a dictionary of the 1027 most commonly occurring words are described."

Only recently, several researchers in off-line handwriting recognition have tried to transpose the HMM technology to their field after realizing that word images could be assimilated to sequences of observations. HMM\u2019s form a family of tools for modelling sequential processes in a statistical and generative manner. Their reputation is due to the results attained in speech recognition which derive mostly from the existence of automatic training techniques and the advantages of the probabilistic framework. This article first reviews the basic concepts of HMM\u2019s. The second part is devoted to illustrative applications in the field of off- line handwriting recognition. We describe four different applications of HMM\u2019s in various contexts and review some of the other approaches."

The script is encoded as templates in the form of a sequence of quantised inclination angles of short equal length vectors together with some additional features. A HMM is created for each written word from a set of training data. Incoming templates are recognised by calculating which model has the highest probability for producing that template. The task chosen to test the system is that of handwritten word recognition, where the words are digits written by one person.

Since the SSA has no control over the means used by employers to prepare the reports, many variations in print quality present. This paper discusses the problems involved in planning and developing a system to read these reports and summarizes the design of the specialized video signal processing circuits and the character recognition logic that are used in the system. Two companion papers treat the latter topics in more detail. Also discussed in the paper is a management information system that permitted detailed analysis of experimental data and accelerated the development process."
