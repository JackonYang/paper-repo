This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

We leverage recent advances of deep convolutional neural networks to generate an ordered highlevel sequence from a whole word image, avoiding the difficult character segmentation problem. Then a deep recurrent model, building on long short-term memory (LSTM), is developed to robustly recognize the generated CNN sequences, departing from most existing approaches recognising each character independently. Our model has a number of appealing properties in comparison to existing scene text recognition methods: (i) It can recognise highly ambiguous words by leveraging meaningful context information, allowing it to work reliably without either pre- or post-processing; (ii) the deep CNN feature is robust to various image distortions; (iii) it retains the explicit order information in word image, which is essential to discriminate word strings; (iv) the model does not depend on pre-defined dictionary, and it can process unknown words and arbitrary strings. It achieves impressive results on several benchmarks, advancing the-state-of-the-art substantially.\n \n"

Different from those in documents, words in natural images often possess irregular shapes, which are caused by perspective distortion, curved character placement, etc. We propose RARE (Robust text recognizer with Automatic REctification), a recognition model that is robust to irregular text. RARE is a speciallydesigned deep neural network, which consists of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a Sequence Recognition Network (SRN). In testing, an image is firstly rectified via a predicted Thin-Plate-Spline (TPS) transformation, into a more \"readable\" image for the following SRN, which recognizes text through a sequence recognition approach. We show that the model is able to recognize several types of irregular text, including perspective text and curved text. RARE is end-to-end trainable, requiring only images and associated text labels, making it convenient to train and deploy the model in practical systems. State-of-the-art or highly-competitive performance achieved on several benchmarks well demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model."

In this paper, we take a different route and combine the representational power of large, multilayer neural networks together with recent developments in unsupervised feature learning, which allows us to use a common framework to train highly-accurate text detector and character recognizer modules. Then, using only simple off-the-shelf methods, we integrate these two modules into a full end-to-end, lexicon-driven, scene text recognition system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, namely Street View Text and ICDAR 2003."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification, we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern data center-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency, mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android."

Contrary to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem. We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list. (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it."

This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learning with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures."

In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it."

Unlike most existing works which assume that texts are horizontal and frontal parallel to the image plane, our method is able to recognize perspective texts of arbitrary orientations. For individual character recognition, we adopt a bag-of-key points approach, in which Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors are extracted densely and quantized using a pre-trained vocabulary. Following [1, 2], the context information is utilized through lexicons. We formulate word recognition as finding the optimal alignment between the set of characters and the list of lexicon words. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset called StreetViewText-Perspective, which contains texts in street images with a great variety of viewpoints. Experimental results on public datasets and the proposed dataset show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on perspective texts of arbitrary orientations."

Though extensively studied, localizing and reading text in uncontrolled environments remain extremely challenging, due to various interference factors. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale representation for scene text recognition. This representation consists of a set of detectable primitives, termed as strokelets, which capture the essential substructures of characters at different granularities. Strokelets possess four distinctive advantages: (1) Usability: automatically learned from bounding box labels, (2) Robustness: insensitive to interference factors, (3) Generality: applicable to variant languages, and (4) Expressivity: effective at describing characters. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks verify the advantages of strokelets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for text recognition."

Our framework does not require any human-labelled data, and performs word recognition on the whole image holistically, departing from the character based recognition systems of the past. The deep neural network models at the centre of this framework are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine -- synthetic data that is highly realistic and sufficient to replace real data, giving us infinite amounts of training data. This excess of data exposes new possibilities for word recognition models, and here we consider three models, each one \"reading\" words in a different way: via 90k-way dictionary encoding, character sequence encoding, and bag-of-N-grams encoding. In the scenarios of language based and completely unconstrained text recognition we greatly improve upon state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets, using our fast, simple machinery and requiring zero data-acquisition costs."

The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU."

We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr9k, Flickr30k and MS COCO."

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

This presents a challenge for feedforward networks: lower layers in convolutional nets capture rich spatial information, while upper layers encode object-level knowledge but are invariant to factors such as pose and appearance. In this work we propose to augment feedforward nets for object segmentation with a novel top-down refinement approach. The resulting bottom-up/top-down architecture is capable of efficiently generating high-fidelity object masks. Similarly to skip connections, our approach leverages features at all layers of the net. Unlike skip connections, our approach does not attempt to output independent predictions at each layer. Instead, we first output a coarse \u2018mask encoding\u2019 in a feedforward pass, then refine this mask encoding in a top-down pass utilizing features at successively lower layers. The approach is simple, fast, and effective. Building on the recent DeepMask network for generating object proposals, we show accuracy improvements of 10\u201320% in average recall for various setups. Additionally, by optimizing the overall network architecture, our approach, which we call SharpMask, is 50 % faster than the original DeepMask network (under .8 s per image)."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

In contrast to previous region-based detectors such as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of times, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we propose position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image classifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), for object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile, our result is achieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image, 2.5-20 times faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart.

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN."

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically."

We learn the network on top of the convolutional layers adopted from VGG 16-layer net. The deconvolution network is composed of deconvolution and unpooling layers, which identify pixelwise class labels and predict segmentation masks. We apply the trained network to each proposal in an input image, and construct the final semantic segmentation map by combining the results from all proposals in a simple manner. The proposed algorithm mitigates the limitations of the existing methods based on fully convolutional networks by integrating deep deconvolution network and proposal-wise prediction, our segmentation method typically identifies detailed structures and handles objects in multiple scales naturally. Our network demonstrates outstanding performance in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and we achieve the best accuracy (72.5%) among the methods trained without using Microsoft COCO dataset through ensemble with the fully convolutional network."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

                "text": "We propose and analyze a nonparametric region-based active contour model for segmenting cluttered scenes. The proposed model is unsupervised and assumes pixel intensity is independently identically distributed. Our proposed energy functional consists of a geometric regularization term that penalizes the length of the partition boundaries and a region-based image term that uses histograms of pixel intensity to distinguish different regions. More specifically, the region data encourages segmentation so that local histograms within each region are approximately homogeneous. An advantage of using local histograms in the data term is that histogram differentiation is not required to solve the energy minimization problem. We use Wasserstein distance with exponent 1 to determine the dissimilarity between two histograms. The Wasserstein distance is a metric and is able to faithfully measure the distance between two histograms, compared to many pointwise distances. Moreover, it is insensitive to oscillations, and therefore our model is robust to noise. A\u00a0fast global minimization method based on (Chan et al. in SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(5):1632\u20131648, 2006; Bresson et al. in J. Math. Imaging Vis. 28(2):151\u2013167, 2007) is employed to solve the proposed model. The advantages of using this method are two-fold. First, the computational time is less than that of the method by gradient descent of the associated Euler-Lagrange equation (Chan et al. in Proc. of SSVM, pp.\u00a0697\u2013708, 2007). Second, it is able to find a global minimizer. Finally, we propose a variant of our model that is able to properly segment a cluttered scene with local illumination changes."

We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN."

The features used in our system are HoGs of variable-size blocks that capture salient features of humans automatically. Using AdaBoost for feature selection, we identify the appropriate set of blocks, from a large set of possible blocks. In our system, we use the integral image representation and a rejection cascade which significantly speed up the computation. For a 320 \u00d7 280 image, the system can process 5 to 30 frames per second depending on the density in which we scan the image, while maintaining an accuracy level similar to existing methods."

To overcome the time complexity involved by the numerical solving of such problem, the original Wasserstein metric is replaced by a sliced approximation over 1D distributions. This enables us to introduce a new fast gradient descent algorithm to compute Wasserstein barycenters of point clouds. \n \nThis new notion of barycenter of probabilities is likely to find applications in computer vision where one wants to average features defined as distributions. We show an application to texture synthesis and mixing, where a texture is characterized by the distribution of the response to a multi-scale oriented filter bank. This leads to a simple way to navigate over a convex domain of color textures."
