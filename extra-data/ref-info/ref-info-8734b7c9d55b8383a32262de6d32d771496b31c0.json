It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

This paper is addressed to the latter problem and is specifically concerned with automatic recognition of aircraft types from optical images. An experimental system is described in which certain features called moment invariants are extracted from binary television images and are then used for automatic classification. This experimental system has exhibited a significantly lower error rate than human observers in a limited laboratory test involving 132 images of six aircraft types. Preliminary indications are that this performance can be extended to a wider class of objects and that identification can be accomplished in one second or less with a small computer."

Its major application, to date, has been to the interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application, features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with the interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained. At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature. One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. The rules are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted."

Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition, who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular, context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations, and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures, presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory. The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages, and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978). As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows."
