In the first part, we review the lexical and grammatical differences between French and English that affect recognition complexity. Then we compute various measurements on a large pseudo-phonetic French dictionary. In the second part, we report experiments on a large real text. To measure recognition complexity, we compute the average branching factor arising in all possible spellings of the phonetic transcription of the text, according to our dictionary. We show that a Markov modeling of French allows us to reduce significantly the branching factor by discarding improbable choices."

The first compares word error rates for 1) meaningful sentences belonging to actual documents and 2) random word lists from the same vocabulary. The error rate is considerably lower for random word lists. The second experiment investigates the performance of the recognition system on sentences containing words outside the vocabulary of the recognizer. Sentences from a 5000 word vocabulary task are recognized with a recognizer limited to a 2000 word subvocabulary. The error rate is only slightly higher than it would be if recognition of the full 5000 word vocabulary was allowed."
