For computational and conceptual simplicity, such a representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. Well-known linear transformation methods include, for example, principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. A recently developed linear transformation method is independent component analysis (ICA), in which the desired representation is the one that minimizes the statistical dependence of the components of the representation. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications. In this paper, we survey the existing theory and methods for ICA."

A familiar example is factor analysis, which is based on a linear transformation between the latent space and the data space. In this article, we introduce a form of nonlinear latent variable model called the generative topographic mapping, for which the parameters of the model can be determined using the expectation-maximization algorithm. GTM provides a principled alternative to the widely used self-organizing map (SOM) of Kohonen (1982) and overcomes most of the significant limitations of the SOM. We demonstrate the performance of the GTM algorithm on a toy problem and on simulated data from flow diagnostics for a multiphase oil pipeline."

In this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably."

We start from the ICA or blind source separation (BSS) model and show that it can be uniquely identified provided it is properly parameterized in terms of one-dimensional subspaces. From this standpoint, the BSS/ICA model is generalized to multidimensional components. We discuss how ICA standard algorithms can be adapted to MICA decomposition. The relevance of these ideas is illustrated by a MICA decomposition of ECG signals."

The ICA model is utilized mainly in blind separation of unknown source signals from their linear mixtures. In this application only the source signals which correspond to the coefficients of the ICA expansion are of interest. In this paper, we propose neural structures related to multilayer feedforward networks for performing complete ICA. The basic ICA network consists of whitening, separation, and basis vector estimation layers. It can be used for both blind source separation and estimation of the basis vectors of ICA. We consider learning algorithms for each layer, and modify our previous nonlinear PCA type algorithms so that their separation capabilities are greatly improved. The proposed class of networks yields good results in test examples with both artificial and real-world data."

The goal of these mappings is to preserve as far as possible neighbourhood relations in parameter space so that local computations in parameter space can be performed locally in the cortex. We have found that, in a simple case2, certain self-organizing models3,4 generate maps that are near-optimally local, in the sense that they come close to minimizing the neuronal wiring required for local operations. When these self-organizing models are applied to the task of simultaneously mapping retinotopic position and orientation, they produce maps with orientation vortices resembling those produced in primary visual cortex5. This approach also yields a new prediction, which is that the mapping of position in visual cortex will be distorted in the orientation fracture zones5"

We show how a neural network learning rule can be transformed into a fixedpoint iteration, which provides an algorithm that is very simple, does not depend on any user-defined parameters, and is fast to converge to the most accurate solution allowed by the data. The algorithm finds, one at a time, all nongaussian independent components, regardless of their probability distributions. The computations can be performed in either batch mode or a semiadaptive manner. The convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proved, and the convergence speed is shown to be cubic. Some comparisons to gradient-based algorithms are made, showing that the new algorithm is usually 10 to 100 times faster, sometimes giving the solution in just a few iterations."

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice.

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

Although the coefficients of this representation are nearly decorrelated, they exhibit important higher-order statistical dependencies that cannot be eliminated with purely linear procssing. In particular, rectified coefficients corresponding to basis functions at neighboring spatial positions, orientations and scales are highly correlated. A method of removing these dependencies is to divide each coefficient by a weighted combination of its rectified neighbors. Several successful models of the steady -state behavior of neurons in primary visual cortex are based on such \"divisive normalization\" computations, and thus our analysis provides a theoretical justification for these models. Perhaps more importantly, the statistical measurements explicitly specify the weights that should be used in computing the normalization signal. We demonstrate that this weighting is qualitatively consistent with recent physiological experiments that characterize the suppressive effect of stimuli presented outside of the classical receptive field. Our observations thus provide evidence for the hypothesis that early visual neural processing is well matched to these statistical properties of images."

This leads to the emergence of oriented linear filters that have simultaneous localization in space and in frequency, thus resembling Gabor functions and simple cell receptive fields. In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces then indicate the values of invariant features."

This statistical technique separates components according to the kurtosis of their amplitude distributions over time, thus distinguishing between strictly periodical signals, and regularly and irregularly occurring signals. Many artifacts belong to the last category. In order to assess the effectiveness of the method, controlled artifacts were produced, which included saccadic eye movements and blinks, increased muscular tension due to biting and the presence of a digital watch inside the magnetically shielded room. The results demonstrate the capability of the method to identify and clearly isolate the produced artifacts."

Most of these linear zones lie between the centers of adjacent ocular dominance columns, with their short iso-orientation slabs oriented perpendicular, in regions enjoying the greatest binocular overlap. These two-dimensional linear zones are segregated by one- and zero- dimensional discontinuities that are particularly abundant in the centers of ocular dominance columns, and that are also correlated with cytochrome oxidase-rich zones within them. Discontinuities smaller than 90 degrees extend in one dimension, as fractures, while discontinuities greater than 90 degrees are confined to points, in the form of singularities, that are generated when orientation preferences rotate continuously through +/- 180 degrees along circular paths. The continuous rotations through 180 degrees imply that direction preferences are not organized laterally in striate cortex. And they also ensure that preferences for all orientations converge at each singularity, with perpendicular orientations represented uniquely close together on opposite sides. The periodic interspersing of linear zones and singularities suggests that orientation preferences are organized by at least two competing schemes. They are optimized for linearity, along with selectivity and binocularity, in the linear zones, and they are optimized for density near singularities. Since upper-layer neurons are likely to have similarly sized dendritic fields in all regions (Lund and Yoshioka, 1991), those in the linear zones should receive precise information about narrowly constrained orientations, while those near singularities should receive coarse information about all orientations--very different inputs that suggest different perceptual functions."

                "text": "It is well established that multiple stimulus dimensions (e.g., orientation and spatial frequency) are mapped onto the surface of striate cortex. However, the detailed organization of neurons within a local region of striate cortex remains unclear. Within a vertical column, do all neurons have the same response selectivities? And if not, how do they most commonly differ and why? To address these questions, we recorded from nearby pairs of simple cells and made detailed spatiotemporal maps of their receptive fields. From these maps, we extracted and analyzed a variety of response metrics. Our results provide new insights into the local organization of striate cortex. First, we show that nearby neurons seldom have very similar receptive fields, when these fields are characterized in space and time. Thus, there may be less redundancy within a column than previously thought. Moreover, we show that correlated discharge increases with receptive field similarity; thus, the local dissimilarity between neurons may allow for noise reduction by response pooling. Second, we show that several response variables are clustered within striate cortex, including some that have not received much attention such as response latency and temporal frequency. We also demonstrate that other parameters are not clustered, including the spatial phase (or symmetry) of the receptive field. Third, we show that spatial phase is the single parameter that accounts for most of the difference between receptive fields of nearby neurons. We consider the implications of this local diversity of spatial phase for population coding and construction of higher-order receptive fields."

The TMP cost function is derived in a Baysian framework of folded Markov chains for the description of autoencoders. It incorporates the data by a dissimilarity matrix and the topographic neighborhood by a matrix of transition probabilities. From the principle of maximum entropy, a nonfactorizing Gibbs distribution is obtained, which is approximated in a mean-field fashion. This allows for maximum likelihood estimation using an expectation-maximization algorithm. In analogy to the transition from topographic vector quantization to the self-organizing map, we suggest an approximation to TMP that is computationally more efficient. In order to prevent convergence to local minima, an annealing scheme in the temperature parameter is introduced, for which the critical temperature of the first phase transition is calculated in terms of and . Numerical results demonstrate the working of the algorithm and confirm the analytical results. Finally, the algorithm is used to generate a connection map of areas of the cat's cerebral cortex."

Reasons for this include the visually intriguing nature of the patterns and the fact that many aspects of their development seem likely to be dependent upon both spontaneous and visually driven patterns of neural activity. Understanding these processes holds out the promise that general theories of learning and memory may be derived from those found to be applicable to the visual cortex. It has turned out, in fact, that remarkably simple models, based on Hebbian synaptic plasticity, intracortical interactions and competitive interactions between cells and growing axons, have been able to explain much of the phenomenology. This article reviews the models of topographic organization in the visual cortex in a roughly historical sequence, beginning with von der Malsburg's paper 1973 paper in Kybernetik on self-organization of orientation selectivity. The principles on which each of the models is based are explained, and the plausibility of each model and the extent to which it is able to account for the relevant experimental data are evaluated. Attention is drawn to the underlying similarities and differences between the models and suggestions are made for future directions in research."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

                "text": "Hubel and Wiesel (1962) first distinguished \u201csimple\u201d from \u201ccomplex\u201d cells in visual cortex and proposed a processing hierarchy in which rows of LGN cells are pooled to drive oriented simple cell subunits, which are pooled in turn to drive complex cells. Although parsimonious and highly influential, the pure hierarchical model has since been challenged by results indicating that many complex cells receive excitatory monosynaptic input from LGN cells or do not depend on simple cell input. Alternative accounts of complex cell orientation tuning remain scant, however, and the function of monosynaptic LGN contacts onto complex cell dendrites remains unknown. We have used a biophysically detailed compartmental model to investigate whether nonlinear integration of LGN synaptic inputs within the dendrites of individual pyramidal cells could contribute to complex-cell receptive field structure. We show that an isolated cortical neuron with \u201cactive\u201d dendrites, driven only by excitatory inputs from overlapping ON- and OFF-center LGN subfields, can produce clear phase-invariant orientation tuning\u2014a hallmark response characteristic of a complex cell. The tuning is shown to depend critically both on the spatial arrangement of LGN synaptic contacts across the complex cell dendritic tree, established by a Hebbian developmental principle, and on the physiological efficacy of excitatory voltage-dependent dendritic ion channels. We conclude that unoriented LGN inputs to a complex cell could contribute in a significant way to its orientation tuning, acting in concert with oriented inputs to the same cell provided by simple cells or other complex cells. As such, our model provides a novel, experimentally testable hypothesis regarding the basis of orientation tuning in the complex cell population, and more generally underscores the potential importance of nonlinear intradendritic subunit processing in cortical neurophysiology."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

                "text": "Source separation consists of recovering a set of independent signals when only mixtures with unknown coefficients are observed. This paper introduces a class of adaptive algorithms for source separation that implements an adaptive version of equivariant estimation and is henceforth called equivariant adaptive separation via independence (EASI). The EASI algorithms are based on the idea of serial updating. This specific form of matrix updates systematically yields algorithms with a simple structure for both real and complex mixtures. Most importantly, the performance of an EASI algorithm does not depend on the mixing matrix. In particular, convergence rates, stability conditions, and interference rejection levels depend only on the (normalized) distributions of the source signals. Closed-form expressions of these quantities are given via an asymptotic performance analysis. The theme of equivariance is stressed throughout the paper. The source separation problem has an underlying multiplicative structure. The parameter space forms a (matrix) multiplicative group. We explore the (favorable) consequences of this fact on implementation, performance, and optimization of EASI algorithms."

The model accurately estimated multiple disparities in regions, which may be caused by transparency or occlusion. The selective integration of reliable local estimates enabled the network to generate accurate disparity estimates on normal and transparent random-dot stereograms. The model was consistent with human psychophysical results on the effects of spatial-frequency filtering on disparity sensitivity. The responses of neurons in macaque area V2 to random-dot stereograms are consistent with the prediction of the model that a subset of neurons responsible for disparity selection should be sensitive to disparity gradients."

Each point is the average of 10 experiments. to estimate the cross-cumulants. Each point in Fig. 1 corresponds to the average over 10 experiments, in which the mixing matrix is randomly chosen: The matrix entries mC3 (i # j) are random numbers in the range [-1, +1]. With 500 samples, a residual crosstalk of about-20 dB is obtained. In the case of nonstationary signals, cross-cumulant estimation must be done on few samples and has a larger variance. Consequently, it can lead to more inaccurate estimation of the mixing matrix. We still obtained an interesting performance: a residual crosstalk of about-15 to-20 dB, with various signals (colored noise, speech) and statistics estimated over 500 samples. In this correspondence, we proved that the mixing matrix can be. estimated using fourth-ordercross-cumulants, for two mixtures of two non-Gaussian sources. Solutions are obtained by rooting a fourth-order polynomial equation. Using second-order cross-cumulants allows us to simplify the method; the solution is then obtained by rooting two second-order polynomial equations and gives the result if one source is Gaussian. The methods are then quite simple, but its roots are very sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated cumulants. In fact, this direct solution is less accurate than indirect methods, especially adaptive a l g o r i b s. Moreover, we restricted the study to the separation of two sources, and theoretical solutions for three sources or more seems not easily tractable. However, in the case of two mixtures of two sources, it may give a good starting point with a small computation cost for any adaptive algorithm. REFERENCES J.-F.

The dependency is measured by the average mutual information (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm are verified by computer simulations."

One of these algorithms is developed for on-line learning of a single-layer feed-forward neural network model and a second one for a feedback (fully recurrent) neural network model. The proposed algorithms are robust, efficient, fast and suitable for real-time implementations. Moreover, they ensure the separation of extremely weak or badly scaled stationary signals, as well as a successful separation even if the mixture matrix is very ill-conditioned (near singular). The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by computer simulation experiments."
