Input to the system consists of any digitized radiographic data. Computer assisted tomographic (CAT) scans of the head were used in this first implementation. Using these data and a predefined atlas picture representing an idealized view of the average normal image, an individualized atlas was created. From the individualized atlas, structure size, density, location displacement, and distortion may be calculated. The individualized atlas created using high resolution data, such as the CAT scan, may then be directly superimposed on pictures obtained using lower resolution modalities, such as positron emission tomographic scan images. This allows the precise location of structures poorly visualized by the secondary imaging modality. This system is capable of using either two- or three-dimensional data."

                "text": "Motivated by the need to locate and identify objects in three dimensional CT images, an optimal registration method for matching two and three dimensional deformed images has been developed. This method was used to find optimal mappings between CT images and an atlas image of the same anatomy. Using these mappings, object boundaries from the atlas was superimposed on the CT images. \nA cost function of the form DEFORMATION-SIMILARITY is associated with each mapping between the two images. The mapping obtained by our registration process is optimal with respect to this cost function. The registration process simulates a model in which one of the images made from an elastic material is deformed until it matches the other image. The cross correlation function which measures the similarity between the two images serves as a potential function from which the forces required to deform the image are derived. The deformation part of the cost function is measured by the strain energy of the deformed image. Therefore, the cost function of a mapping is given in this model by the total energy of the elastic image. \nThe optimal mapping is obtained by finding the equilibrium state of the elastic image, which by definition corresponds to a local minimum of the total energy. The equilibrium state is obtained by solving a set of partial differential equations taken from the linear theory of elasticity. These equations are solved iteratively using the finite differences approximation on a grid which describes the mapping. \nThe image function in a spherical region around each grid point is described by its projections on a set of orthogonal functions. The cross correlation function between the image functions in two regions is computed from these projections which, serve as the components of a feature vector associated with the grid points. In each iteration step of the process, the values of the projections are modified according to the currently approximated deformation. \nThe method was tested by registering several two and three dimensional image pairs. It can also be used to obtain the optimal mapping between two regions from a set of corresponding points (with and without error estimates) in these regions."

Objects are modeled as deformable elastic bodies and constraints derived from image data are modeled as eztemal forces applied to these bodies. The eztemal constraint forces are designed to mold a deformable body into a configuration tent satisfies the constraints, making the model consistent with the images. We present a particular shape model whose internal forces induce a preference for surface continuity and axial symmetry. We develop a constraint force for dynamic stereo images and present results for the recovery of shape and non-rigid motion from natural imagery."

                "text": "Image analysis problems, posed mathematically as variational principles or as partial differential equations, are amenable to numerical solution by relaxation algorithms that are local, iterative, and often parallel. Although they are well suited structurally for implementation on massively parallel, locally interconnected computational architectures, such distributed algorithms are seriously handi capped by an inherent inefficiency at propagating constraints between widely separated processing elements. Hence, they converge extremely slowly when confronted by the large representations of early vision. Application of multigrid methods can overcome this drawback, as we showed in previous work on 3-D surface reconstruction. In this paper, we develop multiresolution iterative algorithms for computing lightness, shape-from-shading, and optical flow, and we examine the efficiency of these algorithms using synthetic image inputs. The multigrid methodology that we describe is broadly applicable in early vision. Notably, it is an appealing strategy to use in conjunction with regularization analysis for the efficient solution of a wide range of ill-posed image analysis problems."

Elastically deformable models are active: they respond in a natural way to applied forces, constraints, ambient media, and impenetrable obstacles. The models are fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving their underlying differential equations. Thus, the description of shape and the description of motion are unified."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."
