Previous justifications use intuitive arguments and rely on the properties of entropy and cross-entropy as information measures. The approach here assumes that reasonable methods of inductive inference should lead to consistent results when there are different ways of taking the same information into account (for example, in different coordinate system). This requirement is formalized as four consistency axioms. These are stated in terms of an abstract information operator and make no reference to information measures. It is proved that the principle of maximum entropy is correct in the following sense: maximizing any function but entropy will lead to inconsistency unless that function and entropy have identical maxima. In other words given information in the form of constraints on expected values, there is only one (distribution satisfying the constraints that can be chosen by a procedure that satisfies the consistency axioms; this unique distribution can be obtained by maximizing entropy. This result is established both directly and as a special case (uniform priors) of an analogous result for the principle of minimum cross-entropy. Results are obtained both for continuous probability densities and for discrete distributions."

This produces an image that is maximally noncommittal about the set of relative proportions pi which one wishes to construct. Alternative forms of entropy, notably the \u03a3 log fi form recommended by Burg, refer to the physical process producing the image, and produce results that are maximally noncommittal, instead, about the probability distribution function governing individual realizations of this process. It is appropriate to use a Burg-type form when attempting to predict future samples from the physical process, but not when reconstructing the proportions pi themselves."

We also give examples of optical deconvolutions and tomographic reconstructions to illustrate the generality of application and the quality of maximum entropy images. Some types of data, a such as Fourier intensitites, are inadepquate in themselves to produce a good image.

We present here measurements of the effect towards three rich clusters of galaxies made with the 40-m telescope of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory at 20.3 GHz. These results are three times more sensitive than other results previously reported7\u20139, are free from systematic errors at the 100 \u00b5K level, and provide very strong evidence for the reality of the Sunyaev\u2013Zeldovich effect."
