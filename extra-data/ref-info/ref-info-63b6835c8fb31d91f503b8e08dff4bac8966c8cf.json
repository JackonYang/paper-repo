This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to divide and conquer by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multilevel hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multilevel predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that the system can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets."

Instead, use your sequence learning algorithm (any will do) to implement the following method for history compression. No matter what your final goals are, train a network to predict its next input from the previous ones. Since only unpredictable inputs convey new information, ignore all predictable inputs but let all unexpected inputs (plus information about the time step at which they occurred) become inputs to a higher-level network of the same kind (working on a slower, self-adjusting time scale). Go on building a hierarchy of such networks. This principle reduces the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information, thus easing supervised or reinforcement learning tasks. Alternatively, you may use two recurrent networks to collapse a multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that systems based on these principles can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets. Finally you can modify the above method such that predictability is not defined in a yes-or-no fashion but in a continuous fashion."

Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard back propagation."

These algorithms either are not local in time or not local in space. Those algorithms which are local in both time and space usually cannot deal sensibly with \u2018hidden units\u2019. In contrast, as far as we can judge, learning rules in biological systems with many \u2018hidden units\u2019 are local in both space and time. In this paper we propose a parallel on-line learning algorithms which performs local computations only, yet still is designed to deal with hidden units and with units whose past activations are \u2018hidden in time\u2019.

                "text": "Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

On-line learning based on system realization. 3. Vector-valued adaptive critics. An algorithm is described which is based on system realization and on two interacting fully recurrent continually running networks which may learn in parallel. Problems with parallel learning are attacked by 'adaptive randomness'. It is also described how interacting model/controller systems can be combined with vector-valued 'adaptive critics' (previous critics have been scalar)."
