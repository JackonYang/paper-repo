Support vector machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

We study in this paper the Mercer property of matching kernels which mimic classical matching algorithms used in techniques based on points of interest. We introduce a new statistical approach of kernel positiveness. We show that despite the absence of an analytical proof of the Mercer property, we can provide bounds on the probability that the Gram matrix is actually positive definite for kernels in large class of functions, under reasonable assumptions. A few experiments validate those on object recognition tasks."

Intuitively, given a set of points which belong to either of two classes, a linear SVM finds the hyperplane leaving the largest possible fraction of points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the distance of either class from the hyperplane. The hyperplane is determined by a subset of the points of the two classes, named support vectors, and has a number of interesting theoretical properties. In this paper, we use linear SVMs for 3D object recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on a database of 7200 images of 100 different objects. The proposed system does not require feature extraction and performs recognition on images regarded as points of a space of high dimension without estimating pose. The excellent recognition rates achieved in all the performed experiments indicate that SVMs are well-suited for aspect-based recognition."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

The problem with this approach is that these global features cannot capture all parts of the image having different characteristics. Therefore, local computation of image information is necessary. By using salient points to represent local information, more discriminative features can be computed. In this paper we compare a wavelet-based salient point extraction algorithm with two corner detectors using the criteria: repeatability rate and information content. We also show that extractingc olor and texture information in the locations given by our salient points provides significantly improved results in terms of retrieval accuracy, computational complexity, and storage space of feature vectors as compared to global feature approaches."

In essence, a kernel is a similarity measure between input points satisfying some mathematical requirements and possibly capturing the domain knowledge. We focus on kernels for images: we represent the image information content with binary strings and discuss various bitwise manipulations obtained using logical operators and convolution with nonbinary stencils. In the theoretical contribution of our work, we show that histogram intersection is a Mercer's kernel and we determine the modifications under which a similarity measure based on the notion of Hausdorff distance is also a Mercer's kernel. In both cases, we determine explicitly the mapping from input to feature space. The presented experimental results support the relevance of our analysis for developing effective trainable systems."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints. Results are presented on several sets of real images."

The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classifiers such as SVM's. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically finding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identification/verification and image classification tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker verification and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM's and the generative classifiers in speaker identification and image classification."

The design of this local feature is motivated by a desire to obtain feature vectors which are semi-invariant under common image deformations, yet distinctive enough to provide useful identity information. A recent proposal for such local features involves combining differential invariants to particular image deformations, such as rotation. Our approach differs in that we consider a wider class of image deformations, including the addition of noise, along with both global and local brightness variations. We use steerable filters to make the feature robust to rotation. And we exploit the fact that phase data is often locally stable with respect to scale changes, noise, and common brightness changes. We provide empirical results comparing our local feature with one based on differential invariants. The results show that our phase-based local feature leads to better performance when dealing with common illumination changes and 2-D rotation, while giving comparable effects in terms of scale changes."

In this paper we introduce two evaluation criteria for interest points' repeatability rate and information content. Repeatability rate evaluates the geometric stability under different transformations. Information content measures the distinctiveness of features. Different interest point detectors are compared using these two criteria. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

The application areas range from neural networks and pattern recognition to machine learning and data mining. This book, developed from lectures and tutorials, fulfils two major roles: firstly it provides practitioners with a large toolkit of algorithms, kernels and solutions ready to use for standard pattern discovery problems in fields such as bioinformatics, text analysis, image analysis. Secondly it provides an easy introduction for students and researchers to the growing field of kernel-based pattern analysis, demonstrating with examples how to handcraft an algorithm or a kernel for a new specific application, and covering all the necessary conceptual and mathematical tools to do so."
