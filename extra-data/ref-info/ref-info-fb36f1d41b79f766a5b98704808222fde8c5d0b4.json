A taxonomy of tessellations for displaying tabular data is developed. X-Y tessellations that can be obtained by a divide-and-conquer method are asymptotically only an infinitesimal fraction of all partitions of a rectangle into rectangles. Admissible tessellations are the even smaller subset of all partitions that correspond to the structures of published tables and that contain only rectangles produced by successive guillotine cuts. Many of these can be processed automatically. Their structures can be conveniently represented by X-Y trees, which facilitate relating hierarchical row and column headings to content cells. A formal grammar is proposed for characterizing the X-Y trees of layout-equivalent admissible tessellations. Algorithms are presented for transforming a tessellation into an X-Y tree and hence into multidimensional, layout- independent Category Trees (Wang abstract data types)."

The thesis offers a formal description of the table and the description and evaluation of a system which provides instances of that model for table examples. There are three parts to the thesis. The first looks at tables in general terms, suggests where their complexities are to be found, and reviews the literature dealing with research into tables in other fields. The second part introduces a layered model of the table and provides some notational equipment for encoding tables in these component layers. The final part discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of a system which produces an instance of the model for the tables found in a document. It also discusses the design and collection of a corpus of tables used for the training and evaluation of the system. The thesis catalogues a laxge number of phenomena discovered in the corpus collected during the research and provides appropriate terminology."

The tables were edited as needed, then converted into layout independent Wang Notation using the recently developed Table Abstraction Tool (TAT). The output generated by TAT consists of XML files to be used for constructing narrow-domain ontologies. On an average each table required 104 seconds for editing. Augmentations like aggregates, footnotes, table titles and notes were also extracted. Every user intervention was logged and audited. The logged interactions were analyzed to determine the relative influence of factors like table size, number of categories (Wang dimension), and various types of augmentations on the processing time. The analysis suggests which aspects of interactive table processing can be automated in the near term, and how much time such automation would save."

We illustrate the transition by some actual examples of web table conversion. We then suggest that the appropriate target format for table analysis, whether performed by conventional customized programs or by off-the-shelf software, is a representation based on the abstract table introduced by X. Wang in 1996. We show that the Wang model is adequate for some useful tasks that prove elusive for less explicit representations, and outline our plans to develop a semi-automated table processing system to demonstrate this approach. Screen-snaphots of a prototype tool to allow table mark-up in the style of Wang are also presented."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."

A multitude of different HTML implementations of web tables make these approaches difficult to scale. In this paper, we approach the problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attention from the tree-based representation of webpages to a variation of the two-dimensional visual box model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. The there by obtained topological and style information allows us to fill the gap created by missing domain-specific knowledge about content and table templates. We believe that, in a future step, this approach can become the basis for a new way of large-scale knowledge acquisition from the current \"Visual Web."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

More specifically, we exploit the structural information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate better representation of user\u2019s information needs and hence more effective retrieval of tables."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

Document image processing is a crucial process in office automation and begins at the \u2018OCR\u2019 phase with difficulties in document \u2018analysis\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019. This paper presents a hybrid and comprehensive approach to document structure analysis. Hybrid in the sense that it makes use of layout (geometrical) as well as textual features of a given document. These features are the base for potential conditions which in turn are used to express fuzzy matched rules of an underlying rule base. Rules can be formulated based on features which might be observed within one specific layout object. However, rules can also express dependencies between different layout objects. In addition to its rule driven analysis, which allows an easy adaptation to specific domains with their specific logical objects, the system contains domain-independent markup algorithms for common objects (e.g., lists)."

The process by which the X-Y tree data structure converts a 2-D page-segmentation problem into a series of 1-D string-parsing problems that can be tackled using conventional compiler tools is also described. Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing.

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge.

In this survey, the table recognition literature is presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations and inferences. A table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect tables, and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies the decisions that are made by a table recognizer, and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions."

Past experience with standard datasets providing ground-truth for character recognition and page segmentation tasks supports this belief.

This problem may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears. We present a detailed analysis of why table ground-truthing is so hard, including the notions that there may exist more than one acceptable \"truth\" and/or incomplete or partial \"truths\"."
