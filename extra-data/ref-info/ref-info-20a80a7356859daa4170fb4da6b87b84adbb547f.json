The indexing schema, designated as a \"Classification Space\" consists of a Euclidean model for mapping subject matter similarity within a given subject matter domain. A schema of this kind is empirically derived for certain fields of Engineering and Chemistry. A set of five related empirical studies provide convincing evidence that when appropriate experimental procedures are followed a very stable C-Space for a given content domain can be constructed on a surprisingly small data base. Other empirical studies demonstrate specific computational procedures for effective automatic indexing of documents in a C-Space, using a relatively small system vocabulary. One study demonstrates that a C-Space maps subject matter relevance as well as subject matter similarity, and thereby pro- motes effective sequential retrieval ; this result is also shown under conditions of automatic indexing. Negative results are found in an attempt to use the structural linguistic distinction of subject and object as a means of improving techniques for automatic indexing."

                "text": "The application of digital computers to the tasks of document classification, storage and retrieval holds considerable promise for solving the so-called \u201clibrary problem.\u201d Due to the high-speed and data handling characteristics of digital computers, a number of different approaches to the \u201clibrary problem\u201d have been placed in operation [4]. Although existing systems are rather rudimentary when compared with the ultimate goal of an automated library, progress towards that goal has been made in several areas: the organization of a mass of documents through automatic indexing schemes; the retrieval from a mass of documents of only those documents related to an information request made by a user of the library. A high proportion of existing document retrieval systems is based upon the author's background and skill rather than upon a mathematical model. Although allowing considerable success in the initial stages of development, the heuristic approach has a limited potential unless an underlying mathematical rationale can be found. Therefore, the present paper proposes an information retrieval based upon Lazarsfeld's latent class analysis [11], which has mathematical foundations. Although latent class analysis was developed by Lazarsfeld [11] to analyze questionnaires, the similarity of this task and document classification suggests that the mathematical rationale for the former could also provide a useful theoretical basis for the latter.\n Because the number of words contained in even a moderately sized report can exceed the capacity of most computers, some form of data reduction is a necessity. The reduction usually results in one of three levels of abstraction: abstracts of documents, key or topical words which convey the meaning of the document or abstract, and indices or tags based upon key words which are then assigned to the document. In general, indexing systems either assign key words to the document or use several key words to assign tags or indices to the documents. The key words or tags then serve as basic information for a retrieval system. Until a radical change in the data handling characteristics of computers is made, it would appear likely that key words or tags will continue to serve as the raw data for information retrieval systems. Although considerable uniformity exists in basic data introduced into an automated library, many different approaches exist as to the subsequent processing of the data. Several papers are reviewed below, which illustrate some of the considerations that enter into the development of an information retrieval system.\nMaron and Kuhns [8] have developed the \u201cprobabilistic indexing\u201d scheme, which reduces the number of documents searched yet increases the retrieval of appropriate documents. In this approach, a large mass of source documents was read by human reviewers and key words were selected. The key words were then pooled into a few well-defined categories. However, any given key word could appear in more than one category. The resulting categories were then assigned meaningful labels or tags which constituted an index term list. The source documents were then re-inspected and the appropriate tag or tags assigned to the document.\n Document retrieval using the probabilistic indexing scheme is accomplished by presenting the computer with a series of tags and a value of a relevance number below which documents are not of sufficient importance to be retrieved. The tags locate the document, and the value of the corresponding relevance number compared to the lower bound value determines if the document should be retrieved.\nThe high degree of dependence of the probabilistic indexing scheme upon human reviewers greatly reduces the efficiency of the method. If the number of documents, key words and tags were large, a human reviewer would not be able to maintain a consistent frame of reference when assigning tags and relevance numbers. The unique contribution of the probabilistic indexing scheme, however, is the use of relevance numbers in conjunction with the indices. The number provides a basis for determining the relevance of the stored documents to the indexed terms used by the requester of information.\nStiles [10] had also reported the use of an association factor to accompany the index terms assigned to a document. The factor used expressed the discrepancy of the observed joint occurrence from the expected joint occurrence of an index pair, assuming independence. The association factor employed was the &khgr;2 value obtained from a two-fold contingency table involving the pair of index terms. A correlation coefficient, such as tetracortic r which expresses the correlation within the two-fold table, rather than a chi-square value expressing lack of independence would have been more appropriate in the present context. Stiles [10], however, reports that the use of the association factor was found to improve document retrieval.\n A more intensive study of the inter-relationships among words within a document was performed by Doyle [2]. The joint occurrences of word pairs in a body of 600 documents served as the basic data of the study. Two types of word correlations were found to exist within word pairs: adjacent correlations, resulting from words which appeared in pairs due to the nature of our language; and proximal correlation, due to words which are logically related but appear at non-adjacent positions within a document. The statistical effects of these two correlations were denoted by language redundancy and reality redundancy. In addition, a third type of redundancy, documentation redundancy resulted when more than one document could be classified by a given set of key words. The effect of language redundancy can be reduced by pooling adjacent key words and treating the pair as a single key word, thus eliminating the redundancy. Documentation redundancy would be reduced by pooling similar documents and assigning a single label to the batch, thus eliminating unnecessary duplication of effort. Reality redundancy, however, is the result of the author's cognitive processes, and the degree to which the literature researcher can duplicate this redundancy determines how successfully the original document can be retrieved. This study indicates that an important function in an information retrieval system is machinery for reducing the effects of language and documentation redundancy so that important relationships are not obscured.\nThe results of the three studies reviewed above indicated document retrieval can be improved if the documents are surveyed for document redundancy and if the relationships among the key words are filtered to remove language redundancy. In addition, the use of a relevance number relating the document and key words appears to increase the efficiency of document retrieval."

Its main concern is with the weighting of index terms as a device for increasing retrieval effectiveness. Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non\u2010linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non\u2010linear weighting scheme is examined."

The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated. Of the ninety documents in the Validation Group which contained two or more clue words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or 48.9%, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula. The experimental evidence supports the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique. (Author)"

Three design principles are presented and discussed: uncertainty (subject indexing is indeterminate and probabilistic beyond a certain point), variety (by Ashby\u2019s law of requisite variety, variety of searcher query must equal variety of document indexing), and complexity (the search process, particularly during the entry and orientation phases, is subtler and more complex, on several grounds, than current models assume). Design features presented are an access phase, including entry and orientation, a hunting phase, and a selection phase. An end-user thesaurus and a front-end system mind are presented as examples of online catalog system components to improve searcher success during entry and orientation. The proposed model is \u201cwrapped around\u201d existing Library of Congress subject-heading indexing in such a way as to enhance access greatly without requiring reindexing. It is argued that both for cost reasons and in principle this is a superior approach to other design philosophies."

As a background we shall present in the following sections some fundamental clarifications and remarks on our specific view of lemmatization and disambiguation. Our starting point is the double assertion that we believe would be shared by many workers in applied computational linguistics and large text-processing projects, to wit: that on the one hand lemmatization is one of the most important and crucial steps in many non-trivial text-processing cycles, but on the other hand, no operational, reasonably general, fully automatic and high-quality context-sensitive text-lemmatization system nowadays is easily accessible for any natural language. Given these two premises, the problem is how to introduce a partial element (at least) of machineaided work in the process of text-lemmatization, so as to avoid the extremely laborious and frustrating task of a word-per-word manual lemmatization of large corpora as was done in the early days of automatic text-processing projects. (For a thorough report on mechanical lemmatization programs, see ref. 4.) In this paper we focus on the analysis and experimental testing of one idea that fits naturally into this framework, namely that of disambiguation by short contexts. (The somewhat unexpected shift from \"lemmatization\" to \"disambiguation\" will be justified in the sections to come.) Based on"

People were asked to name things in a variety of domains: instructions for text-editing operations, index words for cooking recipes, categories for \u201cwant ads,\u201d and descriptions of common objects. We found that random pairs of people used the same word for an object only 10 to 20 percent of the time. But we also found that hit rates could be increased threefold by using norms on naming to pick optimal names, by recognizing as many of the users' various words as possible, and by allowing the user and the system several guesses in trying to hit upon the desired target."

It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

                "text": "Simple structure and other common principles of factor rotation do not in general provide strong grounds for attributing explanatory significance to the factors which they select. In contrast, it is shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis for determining explanatory factors for three-way or higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data variation, systemand object-variation, and PP analysis is found to apply in the system-variation case. Although PP was originally formulated as a principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit and generalized frown two to N \"parallel occasions\". As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is demonstrated to give unique \"correct\" solutions with oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with synthetic data of known factor composition, demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear versions of the model, provide data on the minimal necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the properties of the analysis procedures when these minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of the solution given certain conditions on the data. Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a three-way set of real data consisting of the fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11 persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is extracted, consisting of three factors which are highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge and theory concerning vowel quality. The relationships between the three-mode PP model and Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional scaling model are explored."

For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's favorite single word will result in 80-90 percent failure rates in many common situations. An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold improvements."

This paper presents a revised objective function and new algorithm which attempt to prevent the common type of degenerate solutions encountered in typical unfolding analysis. We begin with an introduction of the problem and a review of three-way unfolding. The three-way unfolding model, weighted objective function, and new algorithm are presented. Monte Carlo work via a fractional factorial experimental design is described investigating the effect of several data and model factors on overall algorithm performance. Finally, three applications of the methodology are reported illustrating the flexibility and robustness of the procedure."

A corresponding method of analyzing similarities data is proposed, involving a generalization of \u201cEckart-Young analysis\u201d to decomposition of three-way (or higher-way) tables. In the present case this decomposition is applied to a derived three-way table of scalar products between stimuli for individuals. This analysis yields a stimulus by dimensions coordinate matrix and a subjects by dimensions matrix of weights. This method is illustrated with data on auditory stimuli and on perception of nations."
