First we focus on instantaneous mixtures: observation e(t) is assumed to write as a regular linear transform of the sources, x(t), as e(t)=Box(t). The only assumption requested is that the sources xi(t) are mutually independent, and no additional knowledge upon their statistics is necessary provided they are not normal. Extensions to convolutional mixing are then pointed out, namely cases where e(t)=A(t)*x(t) where A(t) has a rational transfer function. Sensitive improvements to the algorithm of Giannakis et al for MA identification are included. Multivariate ARMA identification can be split into three successive estimation problems: AR identification, monic MA identification, and estimation of Bo in last position."

The advantages of such an approach are that the structure of R/sub 3/ can be exploited by means of the singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate directly the number of coupled sine waves and their frequencies. After a brief introduction to the bispectrum and the phase coupling problem, the following key results are presented: (1) The rank of R/sub 3/ is (asymptotically) equal to the number of coupled sine waves. (2) A pseudobispectrum can be generated using a MUSIC-like algorithm with vectors orthogonal to the (column) signal subspace. (3) The coupled frequencies can be directly estimated from the (row) signal subspace using techniques such as Root-MUSIC or ESPRIT. Examples of simulations using this approach are given.<<ETX>>"

The problem we are addressing here is to recover original source processes by applying an inverse transform, F, based solely upon their statistical independence. The conditions under which this problem is solvable are first pointed out. Then, by imposing the cancellation of output crosscumulants, we obtain a polynomial system of equations that the entries of the linear transform F must cancel. In the ring of polynomials with real or complex coefficients, obtaining a greatest common divisor is not easy; for instance Euclid's algorithm is unstable. Our approach is rather based on a detailed analysis of properties of input cumulants, and provides when p=2 a direct solution, which can be also implemented in an adaptive fashion. The extension to p>2 sources raises several specific problems; the solution we propose in this more general case becomes iterative."

The effect on moment arrays and on cumulant arrays of making linear or affine transformations of the variables is studied. Because of their importance in statistical theory, invariant functions of the cumulants are studied in some detail. This is followed by an examination of the effect of making a polynomial transformation of the original variables. The fundamental operation of summing over complementary set partitions is introduced at this stage. This operation shapes the notation and pervades much of the remainder of the book. The necessary lattice-theory is discussed and suitable tables of complementary set partitions are provided. Subsequent chapters deal with asymptotic approximations based on Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint expansion. The saddlepoint expansion is introduced via the Legendre transformation of the cumulant generating function, also known as the conjugate function of the cumulant generating function. A recurring them is that, with suitably chosen notation, multivariate calculations are often simpler and more transparent than the corresponding univariate calculations. The final two chapters deal with likelihood ratio statistics, maximum likelihood estimation and the effect on inferences of conditioning on ancillary or approximately ancillary statistics. The Bartlett adjustment factor is derived in the general case and simplified for certain types of generalized linear models. Finally, Barndorff-Nielsen's formula for the conditional distribution of the maximum liklelihood estimator is derived and discussed. More than 200 Exercises are provided to illustrate the uses of tensor methodology."

By integrating ideas from pattern recognition and model identification, asymptotically optimum maximum-likelihood classifiers and ARMA (autoregressive moving average) parameter estimators are derived without knowledge of the data distribution. Identifiability of noncausal and nonminimum phase ARMA models is established using a finite number of cumulant or polyspectral lags of any order greater than two. A unifying view of cumulant and polyspectral discriminant measures utilizes these lags and provides a common framework for development and performance analysis of novel and existing estimation and classification algorithms.

It is shown that, under general conditions, the cross covariance between a stochastic process and a distorted version of another process can be represented by a series of cumulants. The coefficients of this cumulant expansion are expressed by the expected values of the partial derivatives, appropriately defined, of the function describing the nonlinearity. The theorem includes as a particular case the invariance property (Bussgang's (1952) theorem) of Gaussian processes, while holding for any joint distribution of the processes. The expansion in cumulants constitutes an effective means of analysis for higher-order-moment-based estimation procedures involving non-Gaussian complex processes. >"

Three general reasons are behind the use of bispectrum in signal processing and are addressed in the paper: to extract information due to deviations from normality, to estimate the phase of parametric signals, and to detect and characterize the properties of nonlinear mechanisms that generate time series."

AR parameters are obtained in the usual way-via the higher-order Yule-Walker equations based either on the autocorrelations or the cumulants. The first method uses q (where q is the MA order) one-dimensional slices of the output cumulant, whereas the second method uses only two such slices to compute the MA parameters. Neither method involves computation of the residual (i.e., AR compensated) time series of polynomial factorization. Extensions to 2D and multichannel systems, as well as to time-recursive versions, are also developed. Both methods handle Gaussian noise of unknown power spectral densities, at the input as well as the output.<<ETX>>"

We are interested in the identification of this system, observing only the output. This problem is well known under the major assumption: the system is minimum (or maximum!) phase, in which the very popular least squares method gives an identification of the system in an autoregressive form. However, we are Interested in the case where the system is nonminimum (nor maximum!) phase, i.e., we want identification of both gain and phase of the system. The literature gives only a negative result: the idenfication of the phase of the system is impossible in the case of a Gaussian driving noise (hence, second-order statistics are irrelevant to our problem). For a large class of other input distributions, we present an identification procedure, and give some numerical results for a concrete case origin of our study: the blind adjustment of a transversal equalizer without any startup period prior to data transmission."

The method is based on parametric modeling of the third moments of the output sequence and uses causal and anticausal autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models. The magnitude and phase response of the system are expressed in terms of the AR parameters of the ARMA models. In particular, the AR part of the causal ARMA model captures the minimum-phase component of the system, and the AR part of the anticausal ARMA captures the maximum-phase component. Both sets of parameters are obtained by solving overdetermined linear systems of equations. A model-order-selection criterion based on third-order moments is proposed. The ARMA bispectrum approach is compared to more conventional approaches for magnitude and phase reconstruction. It is demonstrated that the proposed identification procedure exhibits improved modeling performance. The method does not require knowledge of the non-Gaussian noise distribution. >"

In this context, the following problem is addressed: Given time-domain measurements, estimate rational orthonormal spanning vectors for the signal and noise subspaces. It is shown that the problem can be rephrased as adapting a lossless transfer matrix so as to maximize the power split between two sets of output bins. An efficient and numerically robust adaptive filtering algorithm is derived for lossless multivariable lattice filters, and the system can be programmed in real time using CORDIC processors. The adaptive filter equations are consistent with the proper subspace identification if the subspace filter satisfies a sufficient order condition. In under-modeled scenarios the stable stationary points are characterized by a minimized Rayleigh quotient which leads to good subspace fits. The proposed adaptive filter makes real-time rational subspace estimation an accessible alternative to computationally expensive offline techniques. >"

Nonminimum phase ARMA models are not identifiable by using multichannel parameter estimation approaches based on second-order statistics, because these are limited to Gaussian processes. It is widely known that, if time series are non-Gaussian, then nonminimum phase parametric models are identifiable from the time series using their higher-order cumulants. This paper propose a procedure for estimating the coefficient matrices of multichannel nonminimum phase ARMA models, and give a recursive algorithm for calculating the AR coefficient matrices. A simulation example is given to illustrate the results of the proposed procedure."

The measurement noise is allowed to be colored Gaussian or independent and identically non-Gaussian distributed. The ARMA model is not restricted to be causal or minimum phase and may even contain all-pass factors. The unique parameter estimates of both the MA and AR parts are obtained by linear equations. The structure of the proposed algorithm facilitates asymptotic performance evaluation of the parameter estimators and model order selection using cumulant statistics. The method is computationally simple and can be viewed as the least-squares solution to a quadratic model fitting of a sampled cumulant sequence. Identifiability issues are addressed.

In this paper, an improved version of the original GR-SVD algorithm is presented. The new algorithm works best for matrices with m >> n, but is more efficient even when m is only slightly greater than n (usually when m ~ 2n) and in some cases can achieve as much as 50 percent savings. If the matrix U ~s exphcltly desired, then n 2 extra storage locations are required, but otherwise no extra storage is needed. The two main modifications are: (1) first triangularizing A by Householder transformations before bldmgonahzing it (thin idea seems to be widely known among some researchers in the field, but as far as can be determined, neither a detailed analysis nor an lmplementatmn has been published before), and (2) accumulating the left Givens transformations in GR-SVD on an n x n array instead of on an m x n array. A PFORT-verified FORTRAN Implementation m included. Comparisons with the EISPACK SVD routine are given."

There exist counterexamples which show existence of false local maxima when finite-length equalizers are used. Finally, it is also noted that in the presence of additive Gaussian noise of unknown power spectral density at the input to the equalizer (equivalently, at the channel output), it is not clear if the methods proposed in the paper will yield the desired response up to a constant gain. >"

Previous justifications use intuitive arguments and rely on the properties of entropy and cross-entropy as information measures. The approach here assumes that reasonable methods of inductive inference should lead to consistent results when there are different ways of taking the same information into account (for example, in different coordinate system). This requirement is formalized as four consistency axioms. These are stated in terms of an abstract information operator and make no reference to information measures. It is proved that the principle of maximum entropy is correct in the following sense: maximizing any function but entropy will lead to inconsistency unless that function and entropy have identical maxima. In other words given information in the form of constraints on expected values, there is only one (distribution satisfying the constraints that can be chosen by a procedure that satisfies the consistency axioms; this unique distribution can be obtained by maximizing entropy. This result is established both directly and as a special case (uniform priors) of an analogous result for the principle of minimum cross-entropy. Results are obtained both for continuous probability densities and for discrete distributions."

En effet, il est possible de construire les estimateurs de certains parametres d'un tel systeme au sens du maximum de vraisemblance pour ce type de signaux. Il est alors possible de separer des sources moyennant quelques hypotheses supplementaires sur le mode de propagation des signaux dans le milieu traverse pour resoudre totalement le probleme. Des lors que ces hypotheses physiques ne sont plus valides, on montre qu'il n'est plus possible de separer des sources notamment s'il s'agit de signaux non gaussiens, en utilisant la meme demarche. Ce cas de figure est precisement la situation traitee dans ce manuscrit. Nous montrerons qu'il est possible de construite la fonctionnelle de vraisemblance d'un tel systeme; celle-ci doit prendre en compte non seulement des criteres de puissance, mais doit permettre de decrire l'independance des sources d'une maniere plus precise. Il est alors necessaire d'introduire des statistiques d'ordre superieur. En pratique nous utiliserons un developpement de gram-charlier des densites de probabilite pour apprecier cette independance. Nous nous limiterons a un developpement d'ordre quatre faisant apparaitre des cumulants de meme ordre. Ces quantites statistiques possedent une structure tensorielle que nous utiliserons dans nos developpements apres en avoir expose les proprietes. Nous serons egalement amenes a preciser les notions de variables aleatoires complexes circulaires. L'algorithme propose donnant une solution du probleme au sens du maximum de vraisemblance presente la particularite de completer les algorithmes classiques classiques d'ordre deux par un algorithme specifiquement d'ordre quatre. Des exemples d'application de cet algorithme sont alors donnes"
