These are difficult to analyze because they are often damaged due to their age and conservation. Therefore we have to introduce knowledge to compensate for missing information and noise in these documents. As there is a very important number of documents of a same type, the cost is not significant to introduce this explicit knowledge. We also want to minimalize the cost to adapt the system for a given document type. The precision of the knowledge given by the user is dependent on the quality of the document. The more the document is damaged, the more the specification has to be precise.

We propose the Description and Modification of Segmentation (DMOS) method, which is made of a new grammatical language (Enhanced Position Formalism\u2014EPF) and an associated parser able to deal with noise. From an EPF description of a kind of document structure, a new recognition system is produced by compilation. This method has been successfully used to produce recognition systems on musical scores, mathematical formulae and even tennis courts in videos. This DMOS generic method separates knowledge from program. Therefore, for a same kind of document like table structures, it is possible to define with EPF, more or less specific descriptions to produce more or less specific recognition systems. For example, we have been able to produce a general recognition system of table structures. It can recognize the hierarchical organization \nof a table made with rulings, whatever the number/size of column/rows and the deep of the hierarchy contents in it, as soon as the document has a not too bad quality (no missing rulings for example). We will present the way the description is done using EPF to be general enough to recognize very different table organizations. With the same DMOS generic method, we have also been able to easily define a specific recognition system of the table structure of quite damaged military forms of the 19th century. This specific description was necessary to compensate some missing informations concerning the table structure of those military forms, due to a very bad quality or hidden part of the table. This system has been successfully validated on 88,745 images, showing that this DMOS generic method can be used at an industrial level."

As an initial step toward automating access to this information, we describe in this paper an algorithmic process to automatically identify record patterns found in microfilm tables for pre-specified application domains. Our table-processing algorithm accepts an XML input file describing the individual cells of a table taken from a microfilm document, and finds for each record in the document the cells that together comprise the record. Two key features drive the algorithm: (1) geometric layout and (2) label matching with respect to a given domain-specific application ontology. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92% on our test corpus of genealogical microfilm tables."

Since the originals of such a material are often unique and scattered in various archives, severe problems arise for their wide fruition. A solution would be to develop intelligent document processing tools that automatically transform printed documents into a Web-accessible form such as XML. Here, we propose the use of a document processing system, WISDOM++, which uses heavily machine learning techniques in order to perform such a task, and report promising results obtained in preliminary experiments."

This approach has been found to be essential in order to capture the curators' expertise about existing card archive structures, content and databases. The design currently achieves about 93% correct segmentation of the required archive card fields overall, with 81.3% of all archive cards in a testset of 2000 images having all fields correctly segmented and labeled. Analysis of errors in the testset indicates that heavily-annotated cards and non-standard card formats comprise 5-10% of the overall archive, and a significant proportion of these are unlikely to be resolvable without curatorial intervention."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."
