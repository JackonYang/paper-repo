In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities. We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned if multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evaluate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our models are validated on the CUAVE and AVLetters datasets on audio-visual speech classification, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effective shared representation learning."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

Our approach is particularly fruitful in multimodal fusion scenarios, such as audio-visual speech recognition, where multiple streams of complementary features whose reliability is time-varying are integrated. For such applications, by taking the measurement noise uncertainty of each feature stream into account, the proposed framework leads to highly adaptive multimodal fusion rules for classification and learning which are widely applicable and easy to implement. We further show that previous multimodal fusion methods relying on stream weights fall under our scheme under certain assumptions; this provides novel insights into their applicability for various tasks and suggests new practical ways for estimating the stream weights adaptively. The potential of our approach is demonstrated in audio-visual speech recognition experiments."

A binary classifier can be learned from manually labeled images; while using more labeled examples improves performance, obtaining the image labels is a time consuming process. We are interested in how other sources of information can aid the learning process given a fixed amount of labeled images. In particular, we consider a scenario where keywords are associated with the training images, e.g. as found on photo sharing websites. The goal is to learn a classifier for images alone, but we will use the keywords associated with labeled and unlabeled images to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning. We first learn a strong Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) classifier using both the image content and keywords, and use it to score unlabeled images. We then learn classifiers on visual features only, either support vector machines (SVM) or least-squares regression (LSR), from the MKL output values on both the labeled and unlabeled images. In our experiments on 20 classes from the PASCAL VOC'07 set and 38 from the MIR Flickr set, we demonstrate the benefit of our semi-supervised approach over only using the labeled images. We also present results for a scenario where we do not use any manual labeling but directly learn classifiers from the image tags. The semi-supervised approach also improves classification accuracy in this case."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer \u201cpre-training\u201d phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn good generative models and perform well on handwritten digit and visual object recognition tasks."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

However, in the context of multimodal signal processing, this problem has been studied less. Our approach to feature extraction is based on information theory, with an application on multimodal classification, in particular audio-visual speech recognition. Contrary to previous work in information theoretic feature selection applied to multimodal signals, our proposed methods penalize features for their redundancy, achieving more compact feature sets and better performance. We propose two greedy selection algorithms, one that penalizes a proportion of feature redundancy, while the other uses conditional mutual information as an evaluation measure, for the selection of visual features for audio-visual speech recognition. Our features perform better than linear discriminant analysis, the most usual transform for dimensionality reduction in the field, across a wide range of dimensionality values and combined with audio at different quality levels."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

The database includes all the original user tags and EXIF metadata. Additionally, detailed and accurate annotations are provided for topics corresponding to the most prominent visual concepts in the user tag data. The rich metadata allow for a wide variety of image retrieval benchmarking scenarios.\n In this paper, we provide an overview of the various strategies that were devised for automatic visual concept detection using the MIR Flickr collection. In particular we discuss results from various experiments in combining social data and low-level content-based descriptors to improve the accuracy of visual concept classifiers. Additionally, we present retrieval results obtained by relevance feedback methods, demonstrating (i) how their performance can be enhanced using features based on visual concept classifiers, and (ii) how their performance, based on small samples, can be measured relative to their large sample classifier counterparts.\n Additionally, we identify a number of promising trends and ideas in visual concept detection. To keep the MIR Flickr collection up-to-date on these developments, we have formulated two new initiatives to extend the original image collection. First, the collection will be extended to one million Creative Commons Flickr images. Second, a number of state-of-the-art content-based descriptors will be made available for the entire collection."

Audio-visual speech recognition is one area with great potential. Difficulties due to background noise and multiple speakers are significantly reduced by the additional information provided by extra visual features. Despite a few efforts to create databases in this area, none has emerged as a standard for comparison for several possible reasons. This paper seeks to introduce a new audiovisual database that is flexible and fairly comprehensive, yet easily available to researchers on one DVD. The CUAVE database is a speaker-independent corpus of over 7,000 utterances of both connected and isolated digits. It is designed to meet several goals that are discussed in this paper. The most notable are availability of the database, flexibility for use of the audio-visual data, and realistic considerations in the recordings (such as speaker movement). Another important focus of the database is the inclusion of pairs of simultaneous speakers, the first documented database of this kind. The overall goal of this project is to facilitate more widespread audio-visual research through an easily available database. For information on obtaining CUAVE, please visit our webpage (http://ece.clemson.edu/speech)."

The model can be represented by a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky. In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis. In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model. Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation. In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images."

To date, the vast majority of work in this field has viewed these visual features in a holistic manner, which may not take into account the various changes that occur within articulation (process of changing the shape of the vocal tract using the articulators, i.e lips and jaw). Motivated by the work being conducted in fields of audio-visual automatic speech \nrecognition (AVASR) and face recognition using articulatory \nfeatures (AFs) and patches respectively, we present a \nproof of concept paper which represents the mouth region as a ensemble of image patches. Our experiments show that by dealing with the mouth region in this manner, we are able to extract more speech information from the visual domain. For the task of visual-only speaker-independent isolated digit recognition, we were able to improve the relative word error rate by more than 23\\% on the CUAVE audio-visual corpus."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

We integrate speech cues from many sources and this improves intelligibility, especially when the acoustic signal is degraded. The paper shows how this additional, often complementary, visual speech information can be used for speech recognition. Three methods for parameterizing lip image sequences for recognition using hidden Markov models are compared. Two of these are top-down approaches that fit a model of the inner and outer lip contours and derive lipreading features from a principal component analysis of shape or shape and appearance, respectively. The third, bottom-up, method uses a nonlinear scale-space analysis to form features directly from the pixel intensity. All methods are compared on a multitalker visual speech recognition task of isolated letters."

In particular, our model facilitates efficient inference and robust topic mixing, and potentially provides high flexibilities in modeling the latent topic spaces. A contrastive divergence and a variational algorithm are derived for learning. We specialized our model to a dual-wing harmonium for captioned images, incorporating a multivariate Poisson for word-counts and a multivariate Gaussian for color histogram. We present empirical results on the applications of this model to classification, retrieval and image annotation on news video collections, and we report an extensive comparison with various extant models."

In this paper, we present local spatiotemporal descriptors to represent and recognize spoken isolated phrases based solely on visual input. Spatiotemporal local binary patterns extracted from mouth regions are used for describing isolated phrase sequences. In our experiments with 817 sequences from ten phrases and 20 speakers, promising accuracies of 62% and 70% were obtained in speaker-independent and speaker-dependent recognition, respectively. In comparison with other methods on AVLetters database, the accuracy, 62.8%, of our method clearly outperforms the others. Analysis of the confusion matrix for 26 English letters shows the good clustering characteristics of visemes for the proposed descriptors. The advantages of our approach include local processing and robustness to monotonic gray-scale changes. Moreover, no error prone segmentation of moving lips is needed."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

                "text": "In speech recognition, the problem of speaker variability has been well studied. Common approaches to dealing with it include normalising for a speaker's vocal tract length and learning a linear transform that moves the speaker-independent models closer to to a new speaker. In pure lip-reading (no audio) the problem has been less well studied. Results are often presented that are based on speaker-dependent (single speaker) or multispeaker (speakers in the test-set are also in the training-set) data, situations that are of limited use in real applications. This paper shows the danger of not using different speakers in the trainingand test-sets. Firstly, we present classification results on a new single-word database AVletters 2 which is a high-definition version of the well known AVletters database. By careful choice of features, we show that it is possible for the performance of visual-only lip-reading to be very close to that of audio-only recognition for the single speaker and multi-speaker configurations. However, in the speaker independent configuration, the performance of the visual-only channel degrades dramatically. By applying multidimensional scaling (MDS) to both the audio features and visual features, we demonstrate that lip-reading visual features, when compared with the MFCCs commonly used for audio speech recognition, have inherently small variation within a single speaker across all classes spoken. However, visual features are highly sensitive to the identity of the speaker, whereas audio features are relatively invariant."

                "text": "Image annotation is an important computer vision problem where the goal is to determine the relevance of annotation terms for images. Image annotation has two main applications: (i) proposing a list of relevant terms to users that want to assign indexing terms to images, and (ii) supporting keyword based search for images without indexing terms, using the relevance estimates to rank images.\n In this paper we present TagProp, a weighted nearest neighbour model that predicts the term relevance of images by taking a weighted sum of the annotations of the visually most similar images in an annotated training set. TagProp can use a collection of distance measures capturing different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, and global colour histograms. It automatically finds the optimal combination of distances to define the visual neighbours of images that are most useful for annotation prediction. TagProp compensates for the varying frequencies of annotation terms using a term-specific sigmoid to scale the weighted nearest neighbour tag predictions.\n We evaluate different variants of TagProp with experiments on the MIR Flickr set, and compare with an approach that learns a separate SVM classifier for each annotation term. We also consider using Flickr tags to train our models, both as additional features and as training labels. We find the SVMs to work better when learning from the manual annotations, but TagProp to work better when learning from the Flickr tags. We also find that using the Flickr tags as a feature can significantly improve the performance of SVMs learned from manual annotations."

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing.

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

Evaluation criteria include effectiveness of the descriptors in similarity retrieval, as well as extraction, storage, and representation complexities. The color descriptors in the standard include a histogram descriptor that is coded using the Haar transform, a color structure histogram, a dominant color descriptor, and a color layout descriptor. The three texture descriptors include one that characterizes homogeneous texture regions and another that represents the local edge distribution. A compact descriptor that facilitates texture browsing is also defined. Each of the descriptors is explained in detail by their semantics, extraction and usage. The effectiveness is documented by experimental results."

We relate the algorithm to the stochastic approxi- mation literature. This enables us to specify conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution (with proba- bility 1). This includes necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for the solu- tion to be unbiased. 1 Introduction Many learning problems can be reduced to statistical inference of parameters. But inference algorithms for this task tend to be very slow. Recently Hinton proposed a new algorithm called contrastive divergences (CD) [1]. Computer simulations show that this algorithm tends to converge, and to converge rapidly, although not always to the correct solution [2]. Theoretical analysis shows that CD can fail but does not give conditions which guarantee convergence [3,4]. This paper relates CD to the stochastic approximation literature [5,6] and hence derives elementary conditions which ensure convergence (with probability 1). We conjecture that far stronger results can be obtained by applying more advanced techniques such as those described by Younes [7]. We also give necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for the solution of CD to be unbiased. Section (2) describes CD and shows that it is closely related to a class of stochastic ap- proximation algorithms for which convergence results exist. In section (3) we state and give a proof of a simple convergence theorem for stochastic approximation algorithms. Section (4) applies the theorem to give suf\ufb01cient conditions for convergence of CD. 2 Contrastive Divergence and its Relations The task of statistical inference is to estimate the model parameters \u03c9 \u2217 which minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence D(P 0 (x)||P (x|\u03c9)) between the empirical distribution func-"

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."
