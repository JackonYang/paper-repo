The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning, making it feasible to apply them to very large spatiotemporal grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystrom method This method allows extrapolation of the complete grouping solution using only a small number of \"typical\" samples. In doing so, we successfully exploit the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in an image sequence than pixels."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

However, the competing goals of statistical estimation significance demanding few quantization levels versus the necessary richness in representation often prevent a successful application for the color cue, since quantization may result in contouring. We combine a halftoning technique called spatial quantization with distribution-based grouping algorithms to synthesize a powerful color image segmentation technique. The spatial quantization simultaneously determines color palette and halftoning by optimization of a joint cost function. It therefore allows for a highly adapted image representation with a smooth transition of color distributions for non-constant image surfaces."

As presented, their method is restricted to the case where W, the weighted adjacency matrix, is positive definite. Although many common measures of image similarity (i.e. kernels) are positive definite, a popular example being Gaussian-weighted distance, there are important cases that are not. In this work, we present a modification to Nystrom-NCut that does not require W to be positive definite. The modification only affects the orthogonalization step, and in doing so it necessitates one additional O(m3) operation, where m is the number of random samples used in the approximation. As such it is of interest to know which kernels are positive definite and which are indefinite. In addressing this issue, we further develop connections between NCut and related methods in the kernel machines literature. We provide a proof that the Gaussian-weighted chi-squared kernel is positive definite, which has thus far only been conjectured. We also explore the performance of the approximation algorithm on a variety of grouping cues including contour, color and texture."

Recently a number of algorithms have been developed that successfully perform motion segmentation by assuming that the motion of each group can be described by a low dimensional parametric model (e.g. affine). Typically the assumption is that motion segments correspond to planar patches in 3D undergoing rigid motion. Here we develop an alternative approach, where the motion of each group is described by a smooth dense flow field and the stability of the estimation is ensured by means of a prior distribution on the class of flow fields. We present a variant of the EM algorithm that can segment image sequences by fitting multiple smooth flow fields to the spatiotemporal data. Using the method of Green's functions, we show how the estimation of a single smooth flow field can be performed in closed form, thus making the multiple model estimation computationally feasible. Furthermore, the number of models is estimated automatically using similar methods to those used in the parametric approach. We illustrate the algorithm's performance on synthetic and real image sequences."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

First. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems."

A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore, the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on synthetic and real image sequences."

Using normalised cuts we find the most salient partitions of the spatiotemporal graph formed by the image sequence. For segmenting long image sequences, we have developed a recursive update procedure that incorporates knowledge of segmentation in previous frames for efficiently finding the group correspondence in the new frame."

But it can also be considered as a natural generalization of linear principal component analysis. This gives rise to the question how to use nonlinear features for data compression, reconstruction, and de-noising, applications common in linear PCA. This is a nontrivial task, as the results provided by kernel PCA live in some high dimensional feature space and need not have pre-images in input space. This work presents ideas for finding approximate pre-images, focusing on Gaussian kernels, and shows experimental results using these pre-images in data reconstruction and de-noising on toy examples as well as on real world data."

These images are taken in such rapid succession that they form a solid block of data in which the temporal continuity from image to image is approximately equal to the spatial continuity in an individual image. The technique utilizes knowledge of the camera motion to form and analyze slices of this solid. These slices directly encode not only the three-dimensional positions of objects, but also such spatiotemporal events as the occlusion of one object by another. For straight-line camera motions, these slices have a simple linear structure that makes them easier to analyze. The analysis computes the three-dimensional positions of object features, marks occlusion boundaries on the objects, and builds a three-dimensional map of \u201cfree space.\u201d In our article, we first describe the application of this technique to a simple camera motion, and then show how projective duality is used to extend the analysis to a wider class of camera motions and object types that include curved and moving objects."

The output of the algorithm may be compared with the movements that people perceive when viewing two images in quick succession, and it is found that an increase in \u03c3 affects the computed correspondences in much the same way as an increase in interstimulus interval alters the perceived displacements. Provided that \u03c3 is not too small the algorithm will recover the feature mappings that result from image translation, expansion or shear deformation \u2013 transformations of common occurrence in image sequences \u2013 even when the displacements of individual features depart slightly from the general trend."

Traditional methods like the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) help us find the \"best\" such approximation. However, these methods take time polynomial in m, n which is often too prohibitive. In this paper, we develop an algorithm which is qualitatively faster provided we may sample the entries of the matrix according to a natural probability distribution. Indeed, in the applications such sampling is possible. Our main result is that we can find the description of a matrix D* of rank at most k so that /spl par/A-D*/spl par//sub F//spl les/min/D,rank(D)/spl les/k/spl par/A-D/spl par//sub F/+/spl epsiv//spl par/A/spl par//sub F/ holds with probability at least 1-/spl delta/. (For any matrix M, /spl par/M/spl par//sub F//sup 2/ denotes the sum of the squares of all the entries of M.) The algorithm takes time polynomial in k, 1//spl epsiv/, log(1//spl delta/) only, independent of m, n."

                "text": "It is natural to think that in perceiving dynamic scenes, vision takes a series of snapshots. Motion perception can ensue when the snapshots are different. The snapshot metaphor suggests two questions: (i) How does the visual system put together elements within each snapshot to form objects? This is the spatial grouping problem. (ii) When the snapshots are different, how does the visual system know which element in one snapshot corresponds to which element in the next? This is the temporal grouping problem. The snapshot metaphor is a caricature of the dominant model in the field-the sequential model-according to which spatial and temporal grouping are independent. The model we propose here is an interactive model, according to which the two grouping mechanisms are not separable. Currently, the experiments that support the interactive model are not conclusive because they use stimuli that are excessively specialized. To overcome this weakness, we created a new type of stimulus-spatiotemporal dot lattices-which allow us to independently manipulate the strength of spatial and temporal groupings. For these stimuli, sequential models make one fundamental assumption: if the spatial configuration of the stimulus remains constant, the perception of spatial grouping cannot be affected by manipulations of the temporal configuration of the stimulus. Our data are inconsistent with this assumption."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

Our algorithm takes time dependent only on \u03b5 and the allowed probability of failure (not on m, n).We draw on two lines of research to develop the algorithms: one is built around the fundamental Regularity Lemma of Szemer\u00e9di in Graph Theory and the constructive version of Alon, Duke, Leffman, R\u00f6dl and Yuster. The second one is from the papers of Arora, Karger and Karpinski, Fernandez de la Vega and most directly Goldwasser, Goldreich and Ron who develop approximation algorithms for a set of graph problems, typical of which is the maximum cut problem.From our matrix approximation, the above graph algorithms and the Regularity Lemma and several other results follow in a simple way.We generalize our approximations to multi-dimensional arrays and from that derive approximation algorithms for all dense Max-SNP problems."

We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can be computed by the Nystrom method (which is used for the numerical solution of eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller system of size m < n, and then expanding the results back up to n dimensions. The computational complexity of a predictor using this approximation is O(m2n). We report experiments on the USPS and abalone data sets and show that we can set m \u226a n without any significant decrease in the accuracy of the solution."
