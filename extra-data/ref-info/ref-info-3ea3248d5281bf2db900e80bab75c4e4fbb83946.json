We are specially interested in data tables extracted from scientific publications found on the web. We propose a way to annotate data tables from the web according to a given domain ontology. In this paper we present the different steps of our annotation process. The columns of a web data table are first segregated according to whether they represent numeric or symbolic data. Then, we annotate the numeric (resp.symbolic) columns with their corresponding numeric (resp. symbolic) type found in the ontology. Our approach combines different evidences from the column contents and from the column title to find the best corresponding type in the ontology. The relations represented by the web data table are recognized using both the table title and the types of the columns that were previously annotated. We give experimental results of our annotation process, our application domain being food microbiology."

We propose a solution to this problem based on document-independent extraction ontologies. The solution entails elements of table understanding, data integration, and wrapper creation. Table understanding allows us to recognize attributes and values, pair attributes with values, and form records. Data-integration techniques allow us to match source records with a target schema. Ontologically specified wrappers allow us to extract data from source records into a target schema. Experimental results show that we can successfully map data of interest from source HTML tables with unknown structure to a given target database schema. We can thus \"directly\" query source data with unknown structure through a known target schema."

We illustrate through a semantic web based knowledge management approach the potential of applying semantic web technologies in GEODISE, an e-Science pilot project in the domain of Engineering Design Search and Optimization (EDSO). In particular, we show how ontologies and semantically enriched instances are acquired through knowledge acquisition and resource annotation. This is illustrated not only in Protege with an OWL plug-in, but also in a light weight function annotator customized for resource providers to semantically describe their own resources to be published. In terms of reuse, advice mechanisms, in particular a knowledge advisor based on semantic matching, are designed to consume the semantic information and facilitate service discovery, assembly and configuration in a real problem solving environment. An implementation has demonstrated the integration of the advisor in a text mode domain script editor and a GUI mode workflow composition environment. Our research work shows the potential of using semantic web technology to manage and reuse knowledge in e-Science."

The focus has been on building data integration systems that provide a uniform query interface to the sources. A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the query interface and the source schemas. Examples of mappings are \u201celement location maps to address\u201d and \u201cprice maps to listed-price\u201d. We propose a multistrategy learning approach to automatically find such mappings. The approach applies multiple learner modules, where each module exploits a different type of information either in the schemas of the sources or in their data, then combines the predictions of the modules using a meta-learner. Learner modules employ a variety of techniques, ranging from Naive Bayes and nearest-neighbor classification to entity recognition and information retrieval. We describe the LSD system, which employs this approach to find semantic mappings. To further improve matching accuracy, LSD exploits domain integrity constraints, user feedback, and nested structures in XML data. We test LSD experimentally on several real-world domains. The experiments validate the utility of multistrategy learning for data integration and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy."

                "text": "Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

We extracted 14.1 billion HTML tables from Google's general-purpose web crawl, and used statistical classification techniques to find the estimated 154M that contain high-quality relational data. Because each relational table has its own \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, each such table can be considered a small structured database. The resulting corpus of databases is larger than any other corpus we are aware of, by at least five orders of magnitude. \n \nWe describe the WEBTABLES system to explore two fundamental questions about this collection of databases. First, what are effective techniques for searching for structured data at search-engine scales? Second, what additional power can be derived by analyzing such a huge corpus? \n \nFirst, we develop new techniques for keyword search over a corpus of tables, and show that they can achieve substantially higher relevance than solutions based on a traditional search engine. Second, we introduce a new object derived from the database corpus: the attribute correlation statistics database (AcsDB) that records corpus-wide statistics on co-occurrences of schema elements. In addition to improving search relevance, the AcsDB makes possible several novel applications: schema auto-complete, which helps a database designer to choose schema elements; attribute synonym finding, which automatically computes attribute synonym pairs for schema matching; and join-graph traversal, which allows a user to navigate between extracted schemas using automatically-generated join links."

In current implementations, schema matching is typically performed manually, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, previous research papers have proposed many techniques to achieve a partial automation of the match operation for specific application domains. We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular, we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover. We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component."

OntoWiki facilitates the visual presentation of a knowledge base as an information map, with different views on instance data. It enables intuitive authoring of semantic content, with an inline editing mode for editing RDF content, similar to WYSIWYG for text documents. It fosters social collaboration aspects by keeping track of changes, allowing to comment and discuss every single part of a knowledge base, enabling to rate and measure the popularity of content and honoring the activity of users. Ontowiki enhances the browsing and retrieval by offering semantic enhanced search strategies. All these techniques are applied with the ultimate goal of decreasing the entrance barrier for projects and domain experts to collaborate using semantic technologies. In the spirit of the Web 2.0 OntoWiki implements an \u201darchitecture of participation\u201d that allows users to add value to the application as they use it. It is available as open-source software and a demonstration platform can be accessed at http://3ba.se."

                "text": "World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured hypertext documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables project is an effort to extract and make use of the huge number of these structured tables on the Web. A clean collection of relational-style ta- bles could be useful for improving web search, schema de- sign, and many other applications. This paper describes the first stage of the WebTables project. First, we give an in-depth study of the Web's HTML table corpus. For example, we extracted 14.1 billion HTML ta- bles from a several-billion-page portion of Google's general- purpose web crawl, and estimate that 154 million of these tables contain high-quality relational-style data. We also de- scribe the crawl's distribution of table sizes and data types. Second, we describe a system for performing relation recov- ery. The Web mixes relational and non-relational tables indiscriminately (often on the same page), so there is no simple way to distinguish the 1.1% of good relations from the remainder, nor to recover column label and type infor- mation. Our mix of hand-written detectors and statistical classifiers takes a raw Web crawl as input, and generates a collection of databases that is five orders of magnitude larger than any other collection we are aware of. Relation recovery achieves precision and recall that are comparable to other domain-independent information extraction systems."

Informally, a learning experience describes what a learner has done, with what learning resources. We explore technological issues in a semantic web driven learning experience management architecture that supports collaborative learning, i.e., learning by reusing, sharing experience and building knowledge together within a particular domain. We demonstrate that by exploiting the semantic web technology, it is possible to manage the learning resources more intelligently through the use of semantically annotated learning experiences. Work has been done in line with the knowledge life cycle, from building ontology on learning experience, creating semantic annotation to reusing semantics for the learning experience management. Functionalities of ontology management, semantic annotation and reuse have been provided in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). We give a scenario in which the system can be used to assist collaborative learning in different domains through learning experience sharing and knowledge construction."

We are developing these capabilities within the context of two applications: Coalition Search and Rescue (CoSAR-TS) and Semantic Firewall (SFW). We describe how this work has uncovered requirements for increasing the expressivity of policy beyond what can be done with description logic (e.g., role-value-maps), and how we are extending our representation and reasoning mechanisms in a carefully controlled manner to that end. Since KAoS employs OWL for policy representation, it fits naturally with the use of OWL-S workflow descriptions generated by the AIAI I-X planning system in the CoSAR-TS application. The advanced reasoning mechanisms of KAoS are based on the JTP inference engine and enable the analysis of classes and instances of processes from a policy perspective. As the result of analysis, KAoS concludes whether a particular workflow step is allowed by policy and whether the performance of this step would incur additional policy-generated obligations. Issues in the representation of processes within OWL-S are described. Besides what is done during workflow composition, aspects of policy compliance can be checked at runtime when a workflow is enacted. We illustrate these capabilities through two application examples. Finally, we outline plans for future work."

After the first International WWW Conference in May 1994, the formal establishment of the W3C followed on 1 October 1994, founded by Berners-Lee in collaboration with CERN at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS). W3C members enjoy the right to elect a seat on the Advisory Committee. Moreover, they have access to member-only information and are involved in the member submission process. W3C possesses an advisory entity in the form of its Advisory Board, which is generally appointed by the W3C Team. W3C is financially self-supporting. W3C is constantly challenged by the quick evolution of Internet technology.

Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO's computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm."

Observation of dissolved oxygen using new sensors offers an effective way of monitoring changes in biological production. The limits of the application were tested following the transition from winter storms to the spring bloom (2007). Calculation of dissolved nitrogen enables changes in gas saturation due to physical and biological processes to be separated.
