How long does it take to reach its stationary distribution? in fact, this occurs surprisingly rapidly. Previous analysis has shown that the total variation distance to stationarity is large if the number of steps N is 1/4n log n. This paper derives an explicit expression for the variation distance as n \u2192 \u221e in the transition region N \u02dc 1/4n log n. This permits the first careful evaluation of a cutoff phenomenon observed in a wide variety of Markov chains. the argument involves Fourier analysis to express the probability as a contour integral and saddle point approximation. the asymptotic results are in good agreement with numerical results for n as small as 100."

Under some natural probability measure on the set of objects, the measure of the subset of objects having the given property is either 0 or 1. In the latter case we can say that almost all the objects have the property. Familiar examples of this phenomenon are the following: almost all real numbers are transcendental (or normal to every base), almost all integers are composite, almost all continuous real functions are nondifferentiable, etc. It is often the case that the objects under consideration can be partitioned into a countable number of finite classes Cn, with the probability assigned to an object in Cn being just 1/ICn I. In this case, we say that a property Pn satisfies a 0-1 law if the fraction of the number of objects in Cn that satisfy Pn either tends to 0 or tends to 1 as n -x 0o. For example, almost all graphs on n vertices have maximum cliques and maximum independent sets of size at most 2 log n, almost all Boolean functions with n variables have circuit complexity (1 + o( 1 ))2n and almost all binary codes of length n with at most 2nR codewords (with R less than the binary symmetric channel capacity C) have arbitrarily small error probability (a special case of Shannon's coding theorem; see [S48]). One of the first general results of this type was the theorem of Fagin [F76] and Glebskii et al. [GKLT69], which asserts that every property of graphs that can be expressed in first-order logic satisfies a 0-1 law (see [SS88] for recent striking developments in this topic). One obvious method for finding explicit objects having some property Pn shared by almost all objects in Cn is simply to select one at random. With overwhelming probability (tending to 1 as n -x oc), the selected object will have property Pn. Unfortunately, it may be (and often is) extremely difficult to prove that any particular object does indeed satisfy Pn . It is our purpose in this paper to describe a method that can to a certain extent circumvent this difficulty. We will show that, for a variety of families, it is possible to identify a natural hierarchy of equivalence classes of properties, all of which are shared by almost all objects in the family.
