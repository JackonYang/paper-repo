In the simpler experiments the data used for training were noise-free. Here the structure of the machine set the fundamental limitation on the possible performance. In the prediction experiments, random fluctuations in the data also limited performance. Modified training rules, which have not yet been theoretically justified, were developed to cope with the second limitation. Elementary functions were approximated in many of the function modeling experiments; for these functions, the use of a learning machine instead of more conventional methods cannot be justified. However, for more difficult applications, such as those encountered in the prediction experiments, the machine performance was sufficiently good to make the speed advantages of a training machine a significant consideration. Viewed as a statistical procedure, this technique is essentially a non-parametric procedure that can be efficiently performed by a special-purpose computer of the type currently being constructed for pattern recognition problems.

One implication of the performance of this algorithm is that if a concept class can be learned in the PAC model to within some fixed error smaller than 1/2, then it can be learned to within an arbitrarily small error \u03b5 > 0 with time complexity 0((1/\u03b5)(log 1/\u03b5)2) (fixing the sample space and concept class and the required reliability).

If the network is specially constructed to perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models.

Given a population of regression estimators, the authors construct a hybrid estimator that is as good or better in the mean square error sense than any estimator in the population. They argue that the ensemble method presented has several properties: (1) it efficiently uses all the networks of a population -- none of the networks need to be discarded; (2) it efficiently uses all of the available data for training without over-fitting; (3) it inherently performs regularization by smoothing in functional space, which helps to avoid over-fitting; (4) it utilizes local minima to construct improved estimates whereas other neural network algorithms are hindered by local minima; (5) it is ideally suited for parallel computation; (6) it leads to a very useful and natural measure of the number of distinct estimators in a population; and (7) the optimal parameters of the ensemble estimator are given in closed form. Experimental results show that the ensemble method dramatically improves neural network performance on difficult real-world optical character recognition tasks."

                "text": "Many neural network classifiers provide outputs which estimate Bayesian a posteriori probabilities. When the estimation is accurate, network outputs can be treated as probabilities and sum to one. Simple proofs show that Bayesian probabilities are estimated when desired network outputs are 1 of M (one output unity, all others zero) and a squared-error or cross-entropy cost function is used. Results of Monte Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood distributions and a priori class probabilities. Interpretation of network outputs as Bayesian probabilities allows outputs from multiple networks to be combined for higher level decision making, simplifies creation of rejection thresholds, makes it possible to compensate for differences between pattern class probabilities in training and test data, allows outputs to be used to minimize alternative risk functions, and suggests alternative measures of network performance."

                "text": "The task of mapping spelled English words into strings of phonemes and stresses (\"reading aloud\") has many practical applications. Several commercial systems perform this task by applying a knowledge base of expert-supplied letter-to-sound rules. This dissertation presents a set of machine learning methods for automatically constructing letter-to-sound rules by analyzing a dictionary of words and their pronunciations. Taken together, these methods provide a substantial performance improvement over the best commercial system--DECtalk from Digital Equipment Corporation. In a performance test, the learning methods were trained on a dictionary of 19,002 words. Then, human subjects were asked to compare the performance of the resulting letter-to-sound rules against the dictionary for an additional 1,000 words not used during training. In a blind procedure, the subjects rated the pronunciations of both the learned rules and the DECtalk rules according to whether they were noticably different from the dictionary pronunciation. The error rate for the learned rules was 28.8% (288 words noticeably different), while the error rate for the DECtalk rules was 44.3% (433 words noticeably different). If, instead of using human judges, were required that the pronunciations of the letter-to-sound rules exactly match the dictionary to be counted correct, then the error rate for our learned rules is 35.2% and the error rate for DECtalk is 63.6%. Similar results were observed at the level of individual letters, phonemes, and stresses. \nTo achieve these results, several techniques were combined. The key learning technique represents the output classes by the codewords of an error-correcting code. Boolean concept learning methods, such as the standard ID3 decision-tree algorithm, can be applied to learn the individual bits of these codewords. This converts the muticlass learning problem into a number of boolean concept learning problems. This method is shown to be superior to several other methods: multiclass ID3, one-tree-per-class ID3, the domain-specific distributed code employed by T. Sejnowski and C. Rosenberg in their NETtalk system, and a method developed by D. Wolpert. Similar results in the domain of isolated-letter speech recognition with the backpropagation algorithm show that error-correcting output codes provide a domain-independent, algorithm-independent approach to multiclass learning problems."

It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (;i) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced prac- tice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same perfor- mance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk re- veal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

With a large number of predictors, one can find a reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are \u201coptimal\u201d for separating the groups. With two such functions, one can produce a classification map that partitions the reduced space into regions that are identified with group membership, and the decision boundaries are linear. This article is about richer nonlinear classification schemes. Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multiresponse linear regression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. In this paper, we obtain nonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way, any multiresponse regression technique (such as MARS or neural networks) can be postprocessed to improve its classification performance."

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance. (i) The learning follows a power law. (ii) The more words the network learns, the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words, (iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential. (iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training. (v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task, but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However, hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units. This suggests that invariant internal representations may be found in assemblies of neurons intermediate in size between highly localized and completely distributed representations."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

Our experiments show that this procedure can be used to solve hard, randomly generated problems that are an order of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by more traditional approaches such as the Davis-Putnam procedure or resolution. We also show that GSAT can solve structured satisfiability problems quickly. In particular, we solve encodings of graph coloring problems, N-queens, and Boolean induction. General application strategies and limitations of the approach are also discussed. \n \nGSAT is best viewed as a model-finding procedure. Its good performance suggests that it may be advantageous to reformulate reasoning tasks that have traditionally been viewed as theorem-proving problems as model-finding tasks."
