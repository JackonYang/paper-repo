Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."

A two-test method is used to increase the accuracy of the recognition. The first test eliminates a number of records with large differences in major features. The second test selects the one with minimum differences by calculating the total weighted error. Test results are presented.<<ETX>>"

The feature of interest, an eye for example, is described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges, peaks, and valleys in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image by altering its parameter values to minimize the energy function, thereby deforming itself to find the best fit. The final parametr values can be used as descriptors for the feature. We illustrate this method by showing deformable templates detecting eyes and mouths in real images. We demonstrate their ability for tracking features."

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \u201cdetectors\u201d for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

Parameters for the classification were normalized distances and ratios among points such as eye corners, mouth corners, nose tip, and chin point. Later work at Bell Labs (Goldstein, Harmon, & Lesk, 1971; Harmon, 1971) developed a vector of up to 21 features, and recognized faces using standard pattern classification techniques. The chosen features were largely subjective evaluations (e.g., shade of hair, length of ears, lip thickness) made by human subjects, each of which would be quite difficult to automate. An early paper by Fischler and Elschlager (1973) attempted to measure similar features automatically. They described a linear embedding algorithm that used local feature template matching and a global measure of fit to find and measure facial features. This template matching approach has been continued and improved by the recent work of Yuille, Cohen, and Hallinan (1989) (see Yuille, this volume). Their strategy is based on \u201cdeformable templates,\u201d which are parameterized models of the face and its features in which the parameter values are determined by interactions with the image. Connectionist approaches to face identification seek to capture the configurational, or gestalt-like nature of the task. Kohonen (1989) and Kohonen and Lahtio (1981) describe an associative network with a simple learning algorithm that can recognize (classify) face images and recall a face image from an incomplete or noisy version input to the network. Fleming and Cottrell(l990) extend these ideas using nonlinear units, training the system by backpropagation. Stonham\u2019s WSARD system (1986) is a general-purpose pattern recognition device based on neural net principles. It has been applied with some success to binary face images, recognizing both identity and expression. Most connectionist systems dealing with faces (see also Midorikawa, 1988; O\u2019Toole, Millward, & Anderson, 1988) treat the input image as a general 2-D pattern, and can make no explicit use of the configurational properties of a face. Moreover, some of these systems require an inordinate number of training examples to achieve a reasonable level of performance. Only very simple systems have been explored to date, and it is unclear how they will scale to larger problems. Others have approached automated face recognition by characterizing a face by a set of geometric parameters and performing pattern recognition based on the parameters (e.g., Kaya & Kobayashi, 1972; Cannon, Jones, Campbell, & Morgan, 1986; Craw, Ellis, & Lishman, 1987; Wong, Law, & Tsaug, 1989). Kanade\u2019s (1973) face identification system was the first (and still one of the few) systems in which all steps of the recognition process were automated, using a top-down control strategy directed by a generic model of expected feature characteristics."

In the language of information theory, we want to extract the relevant information in a face image, encode it as efficiently as possible, and compare one face encoding with a database of models encoded similarly. A simple approach to extracting the information contained in an image of a face is to somehow capture the variation in a collection of face images, independent of any judgment of features, and use this information to encode and compare individual face images. In mathematical terms, we wish to find the principal components of the distribution of faces, or the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set of face images, treating an image as a point (or vector) in a very high dimensional space. The eigenvectors are ordered, each one accounting for a different amount of the variation among the face images. These eigenvectors can be thought of as a set of features that together characterize the variation between face images. Each image location contributes more or less to each eigenvector, so that we can display the eigenvector as a sort of ghostly face which we call an eigenface. Some of the faces we studied are illustrated in Figure 1, and the corresponding eigenfaces are shown in Figure 2. Each eigenface deviates from uniform gray where some facial feature differs among the set of training faces; they are a sort of map of the variations between faces. Each individual face can be represented exactly in terms of a linear combination of the eigenfaces. Each face can also be approximated using only the \u201cbest\u201d eigenfaces-those that have the largest eigenvalues, and which therefore account for the most variance within the set of face images. The best M eigenfaces span an M-dimensional subspace-\u201cface space\u201d-of all possible images. The idea of using eigenfaces was motivated by a technique developed by Sirovich and Kirby (1987) and Kirby and Sirovich (1990) for efficiently representing pictures of faces using principal component analysis."
