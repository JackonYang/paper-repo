But although the technical properties of these logics have been studied in detail and many examples of human default reasoning have been identified, for the most part these logics have not actually been applied to practical problems to see whether they produce the expected results. \n \nWe provide axioms for a simple problem in temporal reasoning which has long been identified as a case of default reasoning, thus presumably amenable to representation in nonmonotonic logic. Upon examining the resulting nonmonotonic theories, however, we find that the inferences permitted by the logics are not those we had intended when we wrote the axioms, and in fact are much weaker. This problem is shown to be independent of the logic used; nor does it depend on any particular temporal representation. Upon analyzing the failure we find that the nonmonotonic logics we considered are inherently incapable of representing this kind of default reasoning. Finally we discuss two recent proposals for solving this problem."

Methods used include subjective Bayesian reasoning, measures of belief and disbelief, and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Analysis of systems based on these methods reveals important deficiencies in areas such as the reliability of deductions and the ability to detect inconsistencies in the knowledge from which deductions were made. A new system call INFERNO addresses some of these points. Its approach is probabilistic but makes no assumptions whatsoever about the joint probability distributions of pieces of knowledge, so the correctness of inferences can be guaranteed. INFERNO informs the user of inconsistencies that may be present in the information presented to it, and can make suggestions about changing the information to make it consistent. An example from a Bayesian system is reworked, and the conclusions reached by that system and INFERNO are compared."

It obviates the need for a centralized knowledge base interpreter, thereby partially solving the problem of computational effectiveness and also embodies an evidential semantics for knowledge that provides a natural treatment of defaults, exceptions and inconsistent or conflicting information. The model employs a class of inference that may be characterized as working with a set of competing hypotheses, gathering evidence for each hypothesis and selecting the best among these. The resulting system has been simulated and is capable of supporting existing semantic network applications dealing with problems of recognition and recall in a uniform manner. (Author)."

RUM is an integrated software tool based on a frame system (KEE) that is implemented in an object oriented language. RUM's capabilities are subdivided into three layers: representation, inference, and control. The representation layer is based on frame-like data structures that capture the uncertainty information used in the inference layer and the uncertainty mete-information used in the control layer. Linguistic probabilities are used to describe the lower and upper bounds of the certainty measure attached to a well formed formula. The source and the conditions under which the information was obtained represent the non-numerical meta-information. The inference layer provides the uncertainty calculi with which to perform the intersection, detachment, union, and pooling of information. Five uncertainty calculi, based on their underlying Triangular norms, are used in this layer. The control layer uses the meta-information to select the appropriate calculus for each context and to resolve eventual ignorance or conflict in the information. This layer enables the programmer to declaratively express the local (context dependent) meta-knowledge that wil l substitute for the global assumptions traditionally used in uncertain reasoning. R U M has been tested in a sequence of experiments in both naval and aerial situation assessment, consisting of correlating reports and tracks, locating and classifying platforms, and identifying intents and threats."

                "text": "This essay addresses a number of issues centered around the question of what is the best method for representing and reasoning about common sense (sometimes called plausible inference). Drew McDermott has shown that a direct translation of commonsense reasoning into logical form leads to insurmountable difficulties, from which McDermott concluded that we must resort to procedural ad hocery. This paper shows that the difficulties McDermott described are a result of insisting on using logic as the language of commonsense reasoning. If, instead, (Bayesian) probability is used, none of the technical difficulties found in using logic arise. For example, in probability, the problem of referential opacity cannot occur and nonmonotonic logics (which McDermott showed don't work anyway) are not necessary. The difficulties in applying logic to the real world are shown to arise from the limitations of truth semantics built into logic\u2013probability substitutes the more reasonable notion of belief. In Bayesian inference, many pieces of evidence are combined to get an overall measure of belief in a proposition. This is much closer to commonsense patterns of thought than long chains of logical inference to the true conclusions. Also it is shown that English expressions of the \u201cIF A THEN B\u201d form are best interpreted as conditional probabilities rather than universally quantified expressions. Bayesian inference is applied to a simple example of linguistic information to illustrate the potential of this type of inference for AI. This example also shows how to deal with vague information, which has so far been the province of fuzzy logic. It is further shown that Bayesian inference gives a theoretical basis for inductive inference that is borne out in practice. Instead of insisting that probability is the best language for commonsense reasoning, a major point of this essay is to show that real inference is a complex interaction between probability, logic, and other formal representation and reasoning systems."

The presentation is focused on two basic inference schemes : the deductive inference and the combination of several uncertain or imprecise evidences relative to a same matter. Several kinds of uncertainty are taken into account in the models which are described in the paper : different degrees of certainty or of truth may be associated with the observed or produced facts or with the \" if.., then...\" rules; moreover the statements of facts or of rules may be imprecise or fuzzy and the values of the degrees of certainty which are used may be only approximately known.

The formal and practical approaches are divided into four parts (1) specifying a set of distinct propositional spaces, each of which delimits a set of possible world situations (2) specifying the interrelationships among these propositional spaces (3) representing bodies of evidence as belief distributions over these propositional spaces and (4) establishing paths for the bodies of evidence to move through these propositional spaces by means of evidential operations, eventually converging on spaces where the target questions can be answered."

These results, which provide firm conceptual bases for the Dempster-Shafer calculus of evidence, are derived by exclusively using basic concepts from probability and modal logic theories, without resorting to any other theoretical notions or structures. \n \nA form of epistemic logic (equivalent in power to the modal system S5), is used to define a space of possible worlds or states of affairs. This space, called the epistemic universe, consists of all possible combined descriptions of the state of the real world and of the state of knowledge that certain rational agents have about it. These representations generalize those derived by Carnap, which were confined exclusively to descriptions of possible states of the real world. \n \nProbabilities defined on certain classes of sets of this universe, representing different states of knowledge about the world, have the properties of the major functions of the Dempster-Shafer calculus of evidence: belief functions and mass assignments. The importance of these epistemic probabilities lies in their ability to represent the effect of uncertain evidence in the states of knowledge of rational agents. Furthermore, if an epistemic probability is extended to a probability function defined over subsets of the epistemic universe that represent true states of the real world, then any such extension must satisfy the well-known interval bounds derived from the Dempster-Shafer theory. \n \nApplication of this logic-based approach to problems of knowledge integration results in a general expression, called the additive combination formula, which can be applied to a wide variety of problems of integration of dependent and independent knowledge. Under assumptions of probabilistic independence this formula is equivalent to Dempster's rule of combination."

                "text": "Belief networks are directed acyclic graphs in which the nodes represent propositions (or variables), the arcs signify direct dependencies between the linked propositions, and the strengths of these dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities. A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called \"hidden causes.\" It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves."

                "text": "In a recent paper, Hanks and McDermott presented a simple problem in temporal reasoning which showed that a seemingly natural representation of a frame axiom in non monotonic logic can give rise to an anomalous extension, i.e., one which is counter-intuitive in that it does not appear to be supported by the known facts. \n \nAn alternative, less formal approach to nonmonotonic reasoning uses the mechanism of a truth maintenance system (TMS). Surprisingly, when reformulated in terms of a TMS, the anomalous extension noted by Hanks and McDermott disappears. We analyze the reasons for this. First it is seen that anomalous extensions are not limited to temporal reasoning, but can occur in simple non-temporal default reasoning as well. In these cases also, the natural TMS representation avoids the problem. Exploring further, it is observed that the form of the TMS justifications resembles that of nonnormal default rules. Nonnormal rules have already been proposed as a means of avoiding anomalous extensions in some non-temporal reasoning situations. It appears that, suitably formulated, they can exclude the anomalous extension in the Hanks-McDermott case also, although the representation does not adjust smoothly to fresh information, as does the TMS. Some variant of nonnormal default appears to be required to provide a correct semantic basis for truth maintenance systems."

                "text": "Virtually all AI and object-oriented programming languages include inheritance systems. Common examples are FRL, KRL, KLONE, NETL, Simula, Smalltalk, Flavors, and Ada. Systems that permit exceptions to inherited properties, which involves a form of nonmonotonic reasoning, remained unformalized until quite recently. The lack of a formal theory hid some defects in existing implementations. One defect was an incorrect treatment of networks with multiple grounded expansions. (A grounded expansion is the nonmonotonic equivalent of a \"theory\" in ordinary monotonic reasoning.) Another defect was a tendency to reason incorrectly when redundant statements are presented. \nWe present a formal mathematical theory of inheritance and show how the defects in existing systems can be corrected. Our formalism bears some relation to default and nonmonotonic logics, but includes an important hierarchical notion the other systems lack. We prove theorems about the consistency, existence, uniqueness, and constructibility of grounded expansions, and we provide a formal semantics for inheritance in terms of constructible lattices of predicates. \nThe formal theory of inheritance is then applied to the formal analysis of a massively parallel computer architecture known as a parallel marker propagation machine (PMPM), of which the best-known example is Fahlman's NETL Machine. This machine has been proposed as a high speed inference engine for AI. We show that a PMPM can perform correct inheritance reasoning only in certain limited cases. However, through a technique known as \"conditioning,\" the topology of a network can be altered to force the PMPM to produce correct results. We show that conditioning is always possible, and present a simple yet efficient conditioning algorithm. \nAn extension to the usual notion of inheritance allows us to infer, if Fred is a citizen and Dick a crook, that Fred dislikes Dick from the relation \"citizens dislike crooks.\" An exception to such a relation might be \"gullible citizens don't dislike elected crooks.\" We extend our earlier results by developing a formal theory of inheritable relations, including exceptions and their interaction with the IS-A \nhierarchy, and showing how a correct implementation on a PMPM may be achieved through conditioning. \n*This research was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DOD), ARPA Order No. 3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory Under Contract F33615-81-K-1539.

Previously, model-based diagnosis schemes have proceeded through a cycle of assumptions - predictions observations assumptions-adjustment, where the basic assumptions entail the proper functioning of those components whose failure is not established. Here we propose a scheme in which every component's status is treated as a variable; therefore, predictions covering all possible behavior of the system can be generated. Remarkably, the algorithm exhibits a drastic reduction in complexity for a large family of system-models. Additionally, the intermediate computations provide useful guidance for selecting new tests. \n \nThe proposed scheme may be considered as either an enhancement of the scheme proposed in [de Kleer, 1986] or an adaptation of the probabilistic propagation scheme proposed in [Pearl, 1986] for the diagnosis of deterministic systems."

This report describes a TMS algorithm that is substantially different from previous systems. This algorithm performs deduction in traditional propositional logic in such a way that the premise set from which deduction is being done can be easily manipulated. A novel approach is also taken to the role of a TMS in larger deductive systems. In this approach the TMS performs all propositional deduction in a uniform manner while the larger system is responsible for controlling the instantiation of universally quantified formulae and axiom schemas."

                "text": "In this article, we describe a way to propagate belief functions in certain kinds of trees using only local computations. This scheme generalizes the computational scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan ' for diagnostic trees of the type studied by Gordon and Shortliffe2,3 and the slightly more general scheme proposed by Shafer4 for hierarchical evidence. It also generalizes the computational scheme proposed by Pearl5 for Bayesian causal trees. Pearl's causal trees and Gordon and Shortliffe's diagnostic trees are both ways of breaking down the evidence that bears on a large problem into smaller items of evidence that bear on smaDler parts of the problem so that these smaller problems can be dealt with one at a time. This localization of effort is often essential to make the process of probability judgment feasible, both for the person who is making probability judgments and for the machine that is combining them. The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that generalizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on qualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme we describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the successful propagation of probability or certainty factors in expert systems requires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system framework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands for structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general networks occupies a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be done. We would like to emphasize that the basic idea of local computation for propagating probabilities is Judea Pearl's. It is an innovative idea; we do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to Pearl's work. We see our contribution as extending Pearl's idea from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions. We wil describe the scheme proposed by Pearl5 for Bayesian causal trees. Then, we will describe the scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan I for diagnostic trees, and, afterwards, as a background to our own scheme, we will describe qualitative Markov trees. Finaly, we wil describe our belieffunction scheme, which has Pearl's and Shafer and Logan's schemes as special cases."

Professor Polya, a world-famous mathematician from Stanford University, uses mathematics to show how hunches and guesses play an important part in even the most rigorously deductive science. He explains how solutions to problems can be guessed at; good guessing is often more important than rigorous deduction in finding correct solutions. The book as a whole is organized around the central thesis that a good guess is quite as important as a good proof. \u2013 Volume I, on [i]Induction and Analogy in Mathematics[/i], covers a wide variety of mathematical problems, revealing the trains of thought that lead to solutions, pointing out false bypaths, discussing techniques of searching for proofs. Problems and examples challenge curiosity, judgment, and power of invention. The function of the first volume in the theory of plausible reasoning is to provide some concrete mathematical raw material. \u2013 If the first volume is more the mathematician's volume, the second is the philosopher's. Volume 2, on [i]Patterns of Plausible Inference[/i], is more interested in an abstract philosophical discussion of the patterns that the first volume indicates. M.-M. V."

Since numerous authors have rejected probability as inadequate for various reasons, the bulk of the paper is aimed at refuting these claims and indicating the scources of error. In particular, the definition of probability as a measure of belief rather than a frequency ratio is advocated, since a frequency interpretation of probability drastically restricts the domain of applicability. Other sources of error include the confusion between relative and absolute probability, the distinction between probability and the uncertainty of that probability. Also, the interaction of logic and probability is discusses and it is argued that many extensions of logic, such as \"default logic\" are better understood in a probabilistic framework. The main claim of this paper is that the numerous schemes for representing and reasoning about uncertainty that have appeared in the AI literature are unnecessary--probability is all that is needed."

It outlines both the general concepts which underlie our research and the details of KRL-0, an experimental implementation of some of these concepts. KRL is an attempt to integrate procedural knowledge with a broad base of declarative forms. These forms provide a variety of ways to express the logical structure of the knowledge, in order to give flexibility in associating procedures (for memory and reasoning) with specific pieces of knowledge, and to control the relative accessibility of different facts and descriptions. The formalism for declarative knowledge is based on structured conceptual objects with associated descriptions. These objects form a network of memory units with several different sorts of linkages, each having well-specified implications for the retrieval process. Procedures can be associated directly with the internal structure of a conceptual object. This procedural attachment allows the steps for a particular operation to be determined by characteristics of the specific entities involved. The control structure of KRL is based on the belief that the next generation of intelligent programs will integrate data-directed and goal-directed processing by using multi-processing. It provides for a priority-ordered multi-process agenda with explicit (user-provided) strategies for scheduling and resource allocation. It provides procedure directories which operate along with process frameworks to allow procedural parameterization of the fundamental system processes for building, comparing, and retrieving memory structures. Future development of KRL will include integrating procedure definition with the descriptive formalism."

The first part of the paper shows that people assign greater impact to causal data than to diagnostic data of equal informativeness. When the same datum has both causal and diagnostic implications, the former dominate the latter. The ease with which people explain unexpected facts and the reluctance to revise old conceptions in the light of new facts are related to the dominance of causal over diagnostic reasoning. The second part of the paper analyzes the use and neglect of base-rate data in terms of the role of these data in causal schemata. It is shown that base-rate information which is given a causal interpretation affects judgments, while base-rate information which cannot be interpreted in this manner is given little or no weight."

Despite the fact that no use is made of numbers, LL can capture many of the properties of likelihood in an intuitively appealing way. Using standard techniques of modal logic, we give a complete axiomatization for LL and show that satisfiability of LL formulas can be decided in exponential time. We discuss how the logic might be used in areas where decision making is crucial, such as management and medical diagnosis, and conclude by using LL to give a formal proof of correctness of a protocol for exchanging secrets."

This paper provides an axiomatic basis, called a semigraphoid, which captures the structure common to all four types of dependencies and explores the expressive power of DAGs in representing various types of data dependencies. It is shown that DAGs can represent a richer set of dependencies than undirected graphs, that DAGs completely represent the closure of their specification bases, and that they offer an effective computational device for testing membership in that closure as well as inferring new dependencies from given inputs. These properties might explain the prevailing use of DAGs in causal reasoning and semantic nets."

The nodes correspond to variables that can be either constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and information available at the time of the decisions. The influence diagram focuses attention on relationships among the variables. As a result, it is increasingly popular for eliciting and communicating the structure of a decision or probabilistic model. \n \nThis paper develops the framework for assessment and analysis of linear-quadratic-Gaussian models within the influence diagram representation. The \"Gaussian influence diagram\" exploits conditional independence in a model to simplify elicitation of parameters for the multivariate normal distribution. It is straightforward to assess and maintain a positive semi-definite covariance matrix. Problems of inference and decision making can be analyzed using simple transformations to the assessed model, and these procedures have attractive numerical properties. Algorithms are also provided to translate between the Gaussian influence diagram and covariance matrix representations for the normal distribution."

R. Cox, J. W. Tukey, and others. This concept is formulated as a principle of conditionality, from which some general consequences are deduced mathematically. These include the likelihood principle, which has not hitherto been very widely accepted, in contrast with the conditionality concept which many statisticians are inclined to accept for purposes of \"informative inference.\" The likelihood principle states that the \"evidential meaning\" of experimental results is characterized fully by the likelihood function, without other reference to the structure of an experiment, in contrast with standard methods in which significance and confidence levels are based on the complete experimental model. The principal writers up. porting the likelihood principle have been Fisher and G. A. Barnard, in addition to Bayesian writers for whom it represents the \"directly empirical\" part of their standpoint. The likelihood principle suggests certain systematic reinterpretations and revisions of standard methods, including \"intrinsic significance and confidence levels\" and \"intrinsic standard errors,\" which are developed and illustrated. The close relations between non-Bayesian likelihood methods and Bayesian methods are discussed."

The differences between the manifested behavior of the artifact and the predicted behavior of the model guide the search for the differences between the artifact and its model. The diagnostic procedure presented in this paper is model-based, inferring the behavior of the composite device from knowledge of the structure and function of the individual components comprising the device. The system (GDE \u2014 General Diagnostic Engine) has been implemented and tested on examples in the domain of troubleshooting digital circuits. \n \nThis research makes several novel contributions: First, the system diagnoses failures due to multiple faults. Second, failure candidates are represented and manipulated in terms of minimal sets of violated assumptions, resulting in an efficient diagnostic procedure. Third, the diagnostic procedure is incremental, reflecting the iterative nature of diagnosis. Finally, a clear separation is drawn between diagnosis and behavior prediction, resulting in a domain (and inference procedure) independent diagnostic procedure."

When a scientist succeeds in explaining a set of nobservations using a model Mof complexity c then it is generally believed that the likelihood of finding another explanatory model with similar complexity but leading to opposite predictions decreases with increasing nand decreasing c. This paper derives formal relationships between n, c and the probability of ambiguous predictions by examining three modeling languages under binary classification tasks: perceptrons, Boolean formulae, and Boolean networks. Bounds are also derived for the probability of error associated with the policy of accepting only models of complexity not exceeding c.

The domain of hypercalcemic disorders is used to test solution methods that should be applicable to other medical areas. A key design philosophy underlying NESTOR is that the physicians should have control of the computer interaction to determine what is done and when. In order to provide such controllable, interactive aid, specific technical tasks to be addressed. The unifying philosophy in addressing them is the use of knowledge-based methods within a formal probability theory framework. A user interface module gives the physician control over when and how these tasks are used to aid in diagnosing the cause of a patient's condition. This dissertation presents the problems that are addressed by each of the three tasks, and the details of the methods used to address them. In addition, the results of an evaluation of the hypothesis scoring and search techniques are presented and discussed. Additional keywords: artificial intelligence; expert systems; medical applications; computer aided diagnosis; medical computer applications."

It is shown that if the scores are additive for different events and if the person chooses admissible values only, then there exists a known transform of the values x to values which are probabilities. In particular, it follows that values x derived by significance tests, confidence intervals or by the rules of fuzzy logic are inadmissible. Only probability is a sensible description of uncertainty."

Reading his paper was a little like reading a pamphlet on the need for more science content in school curricula, and finding that it was issued by the Creation Science Council. Let me first indicate the extent of my agreement with Cheeseman\u2019s cause. Like Cheeseman, I felt that McDermott\u2019s \u201cA critique of pure reason\u201d (McDermott 1987) underrated the potential of Bayesian methods for nondeductive inference (as noted in my commentary on that paper (Schubert 1987)). Furthermore, I agree that Bayesian methods are often wrongly maligned for being \u201ctoo numerical,\u201d or requiring too much information. Like Cheeseman, I believe that Bayesian methods are appropriate for modelling the \u201cfuzziness\u201d (or better, \u201clooseness\u201d) of natural language. Indeed, I have advocated the very same approach to the interpretation of degree adjectives that Cheeseman illustrates with the examples of tall (Schubert 1978). (I also cited some empirical data favouring that approach over others in the literature.) Finally, I agree with Cheeseman that belief modification in knowledge-based systems ought to be founded on an inductive probability theory rather than on current nonmonotonic logics. However, I think that Cheeseman\u2019s advocacy of Bayesian methods is marred by two misapprehensions. The first (and wont) is that he pits Bayesian methods against logical methods as if they were antagonistic alternatives. This imagined antagonism stems largely from misconceptions about truth and belief. Near the end of the paper, he invites logic back on board the AI ship, but only after duly keelhauling it. The second is that he sometimes misrepresents or misapplies Bayesian methods. I will elaborate on these criticisms in turn. I will conclude with remarks on the relation between logic and probability."

The Hearsay-II architecture is the latest attempt to explore the model. This paper describes experiences gained while successfully applying this architecture to the problem of speech understanding. The major conclusions are: 1. The paradigm of viewing problem solving in terms of hypothesize-and-test actions distributed among distinct representations of the problem has been shown to be computationally feasible. 2. A global working memory (the \"blackboard\"), in which the distinct representations are integrated in a uniform manner, has made it convenient to construct and integrate the individual sources of knowledge needed for the problem solution. 3. The use of a uniform data-directed structure for controlling knowledge-source activity has made the system easy to understand and modify. 4. A solution has been demonstrated to the problem of focus-of-attention in this type of control environment. This solution does not need to be modified when the sources of knowledge in the system are changed."

(The \"true\" probability can be construed here either as the objective probability, or the probability assigned by an expert, or the one assigned eventually in a fuller state of knowledge.) In a general HOP the operation PR has also an additional argument ranging over an ordered set of time-points, or, more generally, over a partially ordered set of stages; PR(A, t, \u0394) is the event that A's probability at stage t lies in \u03b4. First we investigate simple HOPs and then the general ones. Assuming some intuitively justified axioms, we derive the most general structure of such a space. We also indicate various connections with modal logic."

This calculation is based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME), sometimes called the principle of least information, and gives the most unbiased probability estimate given the available evidence. Previous methods for computing maximum entropy values shows that they are either very restrictive in the probabilistic information (constraints) they can use or combinatorially explosive. The computational complexity of the new procedure depends on the inter-connectedness of the constraints, but in practical cases it is small. In addition, the maximum entropy method can give a measure of how accurately a calculated conditional probability is known."

Then, as to acceptance or nonacceptance of all these statements we should adopt that particular policy that would maximize our expected utility.This paper will propose an alternative Bayesian theory of acceptance for empirical statements, which will make no use of special cognitive utilities.

KEYNES'S book is a searching analysis of the fundamental principles of the theory of probability and of the particular judgments involved in its application to concrete problems. He adopts the view that knowledge may be relevant to our rational belief of a proposition without amounting to complete proof or disproof of it, and treats the probability as a measure of this relevance. NO.Otherwise he does not attempt to define \u201cprobability,\u201d regarding it as a concept intelligible without further definition. In this respect, as in several others, he is in agreement with the views expressed by Dr. Wrinch and the present reviewer (Philosophical Magazine, vol. 38, 1919, pp. 715-31), and some comparison of the two presentations may not be out of place.A Treatise on ProbabilityBy J.

This algorithm is as efficient in both time and space as previously reported work [3 3 but always provides a minimum information result. In addition to describing the new algorithm, we will prove that it does indeed satisfy minimum information criteria. Since both algorithms are sub stantially different from the \"Bayesian\" approaches in well known expert systems such as the original Prospector [1], AL/X [8], and MYCIN [9 3, and from the approach of Kulikowski [5], background is provided to show the motivation for using the minimum information approach to Bayesian updating."

The knowledge base consists of disorder patterns in a hierarchical structure that constitute the background medical information required for diagnosis in the domain under consideration (emergency and critical care medicine, in our case). Utilizing this knowledge base, the diagnostic process is driven by a multimembership classification algorithm for diagnostic assessment as well as for information acquisition [1]. A key characteristic of the system is congenial man-machine interface which comes to expression in, for instance, the flexibility it offers to the user in controlling its operation. At any stage of the diagnostic process the user may decide on an operation strategy that varies from full user control, through mixed initiative to full system control. Likewise, the system is capable of explaining to the user the reasoning process for its decisions. The model is independent of the knowledge base, thereby permitting continuous update of the knowledge base, as well as expansions to include disorders from other disciplines. The information structure lends itself to compact storage and provides for efflcient computation. Presently, the system contains 53 high-level disorders which are diagnosed by means of 587 medical findings."

It is an intuitive framework in which to formulate problems as perceived by decision makers and to incorporate the knowledge of experts. At the same time, it is a precise description of information that can be stored and manipulated by a computer. We develop an algorithm that can evaluate any well-formed influence diagram and determine the optimal policy for its decisions. Since the diagram can be analyzed directly, there is no need to construct other representations such as a decision tree. As a result, the analysis can be performed using the decision maker's perspective on the problem. Questions of sensitivity and the value of information are natural and easily posed. Modifications to the model suggested by such analyses can be made directly to the problem formulation, and then evaluated directly."

This system can be represented by an undirected graph G whose set of nodes is determined by the set of processes and set of edges by the neighborhood relation. Neighborhood is meant to stand for resource sharing of some type, and therefore we restrict ourselves to considering computations in which neighboring processes are precluded from being concurrently active. This dissertation contains studies on this type of system when the processes are scheduled for operation according to a scheme that we refer to as Scheduling by Edge Reversal. This scheme is derived from similar techniques previously employed in other contexts, and is based on the manipulation of acyclic orientations of G. \nWe present an analysis of Scheduling by Edge Reversal under synchronous and asynchronous models of computation. This analysis includes studies of the graph structures involved and definitions of concurrency measures. The chief concurrency measure that we analyze is a number depicting a property of G. This number is related to G's chromatic and multichromatic numbers, being in some cases distinct from both of them. We show, in addition, that the problem of maximizing concurrency is NP-complete. \nA second contribution is the definition and solution of a problem on the precedence graphs generated by general asynchronous computations. This is the problem of identifying an optimal global state, according to a criterion that we specify. We show that this problem can be solved through the use of Max-Flow techniques on variations of the precedence graph, despite the known NP-completeness of similar problems on precedence systems. The special case in which the precedence graph is generated by Scheduling by Edge Reversal admits efficient implementations. \nA combination of the previous two contributions yields a proposal to implement the Simulated Annealing method distributedly for some types of functions. The approach is applicable to approximating the solution to a number of NP-complete problems, as for example the problem of finding a maximum independent set of a graph."

The advice is generated by consulting relaxed, easy models which are backtrack-free. \n \nWe identify a subset of CSPs whose syntactic and semantic properties make them easy to solve. The syntactic properties involve the structure of the constraint graph, while the semantic properties guarantee some local consistencies among the constraints. In particular, problems supported by tree-like constraint graphs, and some width-2 graphs, can be easily solved and are therefore chosen as the target model for the relaxation scheme. Optimal algorithms for solving easy problems are presented and analyzed. Finally, an efficient method is introduced for extracting advice from easy problems and using it to speedup the solution of hard problems."

To get a complete psychological theory for such agents, you have to supplement it with input and output laws. On a Bayesian theory that employs strict conditionalization, the input laws are easy to give. On a Bayesian theory that employs Jeffrey conditionalization, there appears to be a considerable problem with giving the input laws. However, Jeffrey conditionalization can be reformulated so that the problem disappears, and in fact the reformulated version is more natural and easier to work with on independent grounds."

A conflict between a set of processes must be resolved in favor of some (usually one) process and against the others: a favored process must have some property that distinguishes it from others. To guarantee fairness, the distinguishing property must be such that the process selected for favorable treatment is not always the same. A distributed implementation of an acyclic precedence graph, in which the depth of a process (the longest chain of predecessors) is a distinguishing property, is presented. A simple conflict resolution rule coupled with the acyclic graph ensures fair resolution of all conflicts. To make the problem concrete, two paradigms are presented: the well-known distributed dining philosophers problem and a generalization of it, the distributed drinking philosophers problem."

The definition of randomness that leads to this framework is simplified and clarified in a number of respects. It resolves certain puzzles raised by S. Spielman and W.

This book provides a comprehensive multidisciplinary picture of the work on causal models. It seeks to address the problem of measurement in the social sciences and to link theory and research through the development of causal models.Organized into five sections (Simple Recursive Models, Path Analysis, Simultaneous Equations Techniques, The Causal Approach to Measurement Error, and Other Complications), this volume contains twenty-seven articles (eight of which were specially commissioned). Each section begins with an introduction explaining the concepts to be covered in the section and links them to the larger subject. It provides a general overview of the theory and application of causal modeling.Blalock argues for the development of theoretical models that can be operationalized and provide verifiable predictions. Many of the discussions of this subject that occur in other literature are too technical for most social scientists and other scholars who lack a strong background in mathematics. This book attempts to integrate a few of the less technical papers written by econometricians such as Koopmans, Wold, Strotz, and Fisher with discussions of causal approaches in the social and biological sciences. This classic text by Blalock is a valuable source of material for those interested in the issue of measurement in the social sciences and the construction of mathematical models."

                "text": "In general, this book is concerned with capital budgeting and decision theory. Specifically, it centers around a singular uncertainty decision the decision by oil and gas operators to drill, or not to drill, a well. Actually, a sequence of decisions must precede this final action, but each one of these preliminary decisions is principally directed toward the final payoff question: Should we invest money in this well? If so, how much should we risk, and how much of the risk should we share with others? The objective of this book is twofold. The first objective is to describe the nature of decision problems in drilling for gas and oil, a business situation where uncertainties are exceptionally great, and to describe how businessmen actually make drilling decisions in the face of these uncertainties. This descriptive section, of great interest in its own right, then provides the foundation for the second objective, which is to explore the possibilities of applying \"decision theories\" to such decisions. This second objective is normative or prescriptive in its attempt to provide the driller with better guides to consistent action to meet his own goals. The presentation of the applications of mathematical theories is kept clear and simple, and the methods suggested for dealing with these problems can be understood by a reader with only a working knowledge of arithmetic and high school algebra. This book should be of interest to several audiences, among whom are the following: ( 1 ) people in the oil industry; (2) people in other industries who are actively interessed in finding ways of making better decisions in situations of risk and uncertainty; and (3) people whose interests are perhaps inore academic and who are concerned with both theory and practice in the area of decision making. xmlui.dri2xhtml.METS1.0.item-descriptionmiscellaneous 380 p., graph.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This extension permits the tracking of statistics of probabilistic opinions, however, as opposed to tracking merely Boolean opinions (or possibilities within the \"frame of discernment\"). Both the Dempster/Shafer formulation and the Hummel/Landy formulation assume that bodies of experts that are combined to form new statistics have independent information. We give a model for parameterizing degree of dependence between bodies of information, and extend the Hummel/Landy formulation for combining evidence to account for sets of experts having dependent information sources."

We consider, among other things, hierarchical hypotheses pertaining to the interactions among the m variables, including hypotheses that can be expressed in terms of one or more of the following kinds of concepts: (a) the usual concepts of independence and equiprobability; (b) concepts describing conditional properties (e.g., conditional independence) pertaining to a subset of the m variables, given the level of some of the remaining variables; (c) concepts related to the usual logit-analysis or to a generalized form of logit-analysis; and (d) concepts related to a more general log-linear model. Methods of partitioning these hypotheses are introduced which provide, among other things, insight into the relationship between tests applied to the m-way table and tests applied to marginal tables formed ..."

In the present paper we show that higher order probabilities can always be replaced by the marginal distributions of joint probability distributions. We consider both the case in which higher order probabilities are of the same sort as lower order probabilities and that in which higher order probabilities are distinct in character, as when lower order probabilities are construed as frequencies and higher order probabilities are construed as subjective degrees of belief. In neither case do higher order probabilities appear to offer any advantages, either conceptually or computationally."

It differs from most other programs for computer-assisted diagnosis in the generality of its approach and the size and diversity of its knowledge base. To document the strengths and weaknesses of the program we performed a systematic evaluation of the capabilities of INTERNIST-I. Its performance on a series of 19 clinicopathological exercises (Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital) published in the Journal appeared qualitatively similar to that of the hospital clinicians but inferior to that of the case discussants. The evaluation demonstrated that the present form of the program is not sufficiently reliable for clinical applications. Specific deficiencies that must be overcome include the program\u2019s inability to reason anatomically or temporally, its inability to construct differential diagnoses spanning multiple problem areas, its occasional attribution of findings to improper causes, and its inability to explain its \u201cthinking.\u201d (N Engl J Med. 1982; 307:468\u201376."

The first of these is a subclass of hierarchical log linear models. Each of its models can be represented by an undirected graph. In the second class each model corresponds to a particular kind of a directed graph instead and can be characterized by a nontrivial factorization of the joint distribution in terms of response variables. We derive decomposable or multiplicative models as the intersecting class. This result has useful consequences for exploratory types of analysis as well as for the model interpretation: we can give an aid for detecting well-fitting decomposable models in a transformation of the observed contingency table and each decomposable model may be interpreted with the help of an undirected or directed graph."

                "text": "In various pattern-recognition problems such as classification of photographic data, preprocessing operations result in a two-dimensional array of binary random variables. An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

We argue that flooding schemes have significant drawbacks for such networks, and propose a general class of distributed algorithms for establishing new loop-free routes to the station for any node left without a route due to changes in the network topology. By virtue of built-in redundancy, the algorithms are typically activated very infrequently and, even when they are, they do not involve any communication within the portion of the network that has not been materially affected by a topological change."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."

This book describes how a confused decision maker, who wishes to make a reasonable and responsible choice among alternatives, can systematically probe his true feelings in order to make those critically important, vexing trade-offs between incommensurable objectives. The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximise. By generalising from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis."

To test whether a correlation between two variables is genuine or spurious, additional variables and equations must be introduced, and sufficient assumptions must be made to identify the parameters of this wider system. If the two original variables are causally related in the wider system, the correlation is \u201cgenuine.\u201d"

When practising, the cord can be aligned with the green or hole and used as an aid in swinging the club face in the correct direction. The casing has a spring-clip so that the article can be clipped into the golfer's pocker when he is not using it."

The method has been applied in quite a variety of cases. It seems desirable now to make a restatement of the theory and to review the types of application, especially as there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding both of purpose and of procedure."

Most current inference systems in artificial intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts. We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements."

Unfortunately, causes of variation often seem to be beyond control. In the biological sciences, especially, one often has to deal with a group of characteristics or conditions which are correlated because of a complex of interacting, uncontrollable, and often obscure causes. The degree of correlation between two variables can be calculated by well-known methods, but when it is found it gives merely the resultant of all connecting paths of influence. The present paper is an attempt to present a method of measuring the direct influence along each separate path in such a system and thus of finding the degree to which variation of a given effect is determined by each particular cause. The method depends on the combination of knowledge of the degrees of correlation among the variables in a system with such knowledge as may be possessed of the causal relations. In cases in which the causal relations are uncertain the method can be used to find the logical consequences of any particular hypothesis in regard to them. CORRELATION"
