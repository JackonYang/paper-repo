Some researches, concerning this issue, have already been reported. However, these methods are not always successful because the recognition procedures analyze document images on the basis of only physical coordinate values of compositive items. This paper proposes a more advanced method based on the spatial relationships among neighboring segments of compositive items, in addition to the geometric aspects. The knowledge about documents is not a single layer, but organized as multi-level layers: knowledge about layout structures, knowledge about item sequences and knowledge about item properties. Three kinds of knowledge are not only specified hierarchically, but also interrelated mutually between the layout recognition, item recognition and character recognition procedures.<<ETX>>"

In this paper, we propose a new method of document image understanding which employs the domain specific knowledge base called document model. Document model is structural representation of constraints on the layout structure as well as the logical structure of a target document. Since the variation of the structure can be described in document model, intermediate results of understanding generally include multiple candidates. In order to generate plausible description from such candidates, we introduce the strategy of hypothesis generation and testing. From the experiments for 100 visiting cards, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

In particular tables are powerful tools that allow large quantities of data to be easily understood. An automated document entry system is needed that can recognize the document layout objects and extract the information from tables. In this paper an effective table recognition method is described. The proposed method is composed of three steps: (1) document layout structure recognition (2) table layout structure recognition (3) table content recognition. To develop the table layout structure recognition step we first examined the layout structure of tables in existing documents and classified several common structures. As a result of the examination we created ten rules and designed a ruled line and box extraction algorithm based on these rules. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed in experiments. Accordingly the proposed method will greatly contribute to the creation of an automated document entry system to allow faster document recognition and permit the data in tables to be extracted."

The basic idea for the recognition strategy is to utilize various kinds of knowledge stepwise on the basis the generation/verification process of object hypotheses. In this approach, such knowledge as layout information of card structures, relationship information among cataloging items, and property information of data items is effectual. The knowledge is not represented as same-level information, but is mutually specified with the hierarchical relationship. Lower-level knowledge is successful for recognizing the processing objects interpreted by higher-level knowledge. Though the authors' primary concern is about the understanding of library cataloging cards, the proposed framework is applicable to other documents with particular layout structures such as pamphlets, letters, office mail, office documents, articles, papers and so on.<<ETX>>"

Therefore, good paper-computer interfaces are necessary to transform paper documents into an electronic form, which allows the use of a filing and retrieval system. An electronic document page is an optically scanned and digitized representation of a printed page. Document analysis is the problem of interpreting and labeling the constitutents of the document. Although there are very reliable optical character recognition (OCR) methods, the process could be very inefficient. To prune the search space and to become more efficient, some search supporting methods have to be developed. This article proposes an approach to identify the layout of a document page by dividing it recursively into nested rectangular areas. The procedure is used as a basis for a document layout model, which is able to control an automatic interpretation mechanism for deriving a high level representation of the contents of a document. We have implemented our method in Common Lisp on a Symbolies 3640 Workstation and have run it for a large population of office documents. The results obtained have been very encouraging and have convincingly confirmed the soundness of our approach."

The basic idea in our method is to utilize the spatial and geometric relationships between document items. Our approach is adaptable even if the layout structures are modified more or less, because the coordinate values of positions, sizes, lengthes and so on are not specified directly. Additionally, some experiments for typical documents such as library cataloging cards, name cards and letters are shown concretely."

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"
