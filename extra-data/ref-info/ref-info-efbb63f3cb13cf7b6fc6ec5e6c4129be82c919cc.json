Many information extraction systems are constrained to extracting binary relations that are asserted within a single sentence (single-sentence relations) and this limits the proportion of relations they can extract since those expressed across multiple sentences (inter-sentential relations) are not considered. The analysis in this paper focuses on finding the distribution of inter-sentential and single-sentence relations in two corpora used for the evaluation of Information Extraction systems: the MUC6 corpus and the ACE corpus from 2003. In order to carry out this analysis we had to manually mark up all the management succession relations described in the MUC6 corpus. It was found that inter-sentential relations constitute 28.5% and 9.4% of the total number of relations in MUC6 and ACE03 respectively. This places upper bounds on the recall of information extraction systems that do not consider relations that are asserted across multiple sentences (71.5% and 90.6% respectively)."

It is not clear what effect this has on the difficulty of the extraction task or how the performance of systems which consider only single sentences should be compared with those which consider multiple sentences. This paper compares three IE evaluation corpora, from the Message Understanding Conferences, and finds that a significant proportion of the facts mentioned therein are not described within a single sentence. Therefore systems which are evaluated only on facts described within single sentences are being tested against a limited portion of the relevant information in the text and it is difficult to compare their performance with other systems. Further analysis demonstrates that anaphora resolution and world knowledge are required to combine information described across multiple sentences. This result has implications for the development and evaluation of IE systems."

The method uses two novel features, 1) whether the candidate words inherently express relations and 2) how the candidate words are influenced by the past relations of two entities. These features together with conventional syntactic and contextual features are organized as a tree structure and are fed into a boosting-based classification algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods."

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression."

Open IE is a relationindependent extraction paradigm that is tailored to massive and heterogeneous corpora such as the Web. An Open IE system extracts a diverse set of relational tuples from text without any relation-specific input. How is Open IE possible? We analyze a sample of English sentences to demonstrate that numerous relationships are expressed using a compact set of relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns, which can be learned by an Open IE system. What are the tradeoffs between Open IE and traditional IE? We consider this question in the context of two tasks. First, when the number of relations is massive, and the relations themselves are not pre-specified, we argue that Open IE is necessary. We then present a new model for Open IE called O-CRF and show that it achieves increased precision and nearly double the recall than the model employed by TEXTRUNNER, the previous stateof-the-art Open IE system. Second, when the number of target relations is small, and their names are known in advance, we show that O-CRF is able to match the precision of a traditional extraction system, though at substantially lower recall. Finally, we show how to combine the two types of systems into a hybrid that achieves higher precision than a traditional extractor, with comparable recall."

The composite kernel consists of two individual kernels: an entity kernel that allows for entity-related features and a convolution parse tree kernel that models syntactic information of relation examples. The motivation of our method is to fully utilize the nice properties of kernel methods to explore diverse knowledge for relation extraction. Our study illustrates that the composite kernel can effectively capture both flat and structured features without the need for extensive feature engineering, and can also easily scale to include more features. Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our method outperforms the previous best-reported methods and significantly out-performs previous two dependency tree kernels for relation extraction."

In this paper, we show that the traditional practice of initializing minimally-supervised algorithms with a single set that mixes seeds of different types fails to capture the wide variety of part-whole patterns and tuples. The results obtained with mixed seeds ultimately converge to one of the part-whole relation types. We also demonstrate that all the different types of part-whole relations can still be discovered, regardless of the type characterized by the initializing seeds. We performed our experiments with a state-of-the-art information extraction algorithm."

However, in many cases, considering influences between different potential extractions could improve overall accuracy. Statistical methods based on undirected graphical models, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), have been shown to be an effective approach to learning accurate IE systems. We present a new IE method that employs Relational Markov Networks (a generalization of CRFs), which can represent arbitrary dependencies between extractions. This allows for \"collective information extraction\" that exploits the mutual influence between possible extractions. Experiments on learning to extract protein names from biomedical text demonstrate the advantages of this approach."

Given a user's query, the system will automatically create patterns to extract salient relations in the text of the topic, and build tables from the extracted information using paraphrase discovery technology. It relies on recent advances in pattern discovery, paraphrase discovery, and extended named entity tagging. We report on experimental results in which the system created useful tables for many topics, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach."

It resolves two critical problems in previous tree kernels for relation extraction in two ways. First, it automatically determines a d ynamic context-sensitive tree span for relation extraction by extending the widely -used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT. Second, it pr oposes a context -sensitive convolution tree kernel, which enumerates both context-free and contextsensitive sub-trees by consid ering their ancestor node paths as their contexts. Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state -of-the-art linear kernel. Evaluation on the ACE RDC corpora shows that our dynamic context-sensitive tree span is much more suitable for relation extraction than SPT and our tree kernel outperforms the state-of-the-art Collins and Duffy\u2019s convolution tree kernel. It also shows that our tree kernel achieves much better performance than the state-of-the-art linear kernels . Finally, it shows that feature-based and tree kernel-based methods much complement each other and the composite kernel can well integrate both flat and structured features."

This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational table that we could use for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks.We explore a technique for extracting such tables from document collections that requires only a handful of training examples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper documents."

For multi-slot IE, we worked on the domain of Management Succession. For this domain, we restrict ourselves to extracting information sentence by sentence, in the same way as (Soderland 1999). Each sentence can contain information on several management succession events. By using a classification approach based on a maximum entropy framework, our system achieves higher accuracy than the best previously published results in both domains."

One part of this system is the identification of relationships between clinically important entities in the text. Typical approaches to relationship extraction in this domain have used full parses, domain-specific grammars, and large knowledge bases encoding domain knowledge. In other areas of biomedical NLP, statistical machine learning approaches are now routinely applied to relationship extraction. We report on the novel application of these statistical techniques to clinical relationships. \n \nWe describe a supervised machine learning system, trained with a corpus of oncology narratives hand-annotated with clinically important relationships. Various shallow features are extracted from these texts, and used to train statistical classifiers. We compare the suitability of these features for clinical relationship extraction, how extraction varies between inter- and intra-sentential relationships, and examine the amount of training data needed to learn various relationships."

The approach combines high performance and efficiency with theoretical understanding and improved robustness. In particular, it is highly effective without greedy heuristic components. The SVM approach is computationally efficient in training and classification, and it comes with a learning theory that can guide real-world applications. Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines gives a complete and detailed description of the SVM approach to learning text classifiers, including training algorithms, transductive text classification, efficient performance estimation, and a statistical learning model of text classification. In addition, it includes an overview of the field of text classification, making it self-contained even for newcomers to the field. This book gives a concise introduction to SVMs for pattern recognition, and it includes a detailed description of how to formulate text-classification tasks for machine learning."

Through a simple example, we first show that SVMs can be ineffective in determining the class boundary when the training instances of the target class are heavily outnumbered by the nontarget training instances. To remedy this problem, we propose to adjust the class boundary either by transforming the kernel function when the training data can be represented in a vector space, or by modifying the kernel matrix when the data do not have a vector-space representation (e.g., sequence data). Through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that the classboundary-alignment algorithm works effectively with images (data that have a vector-space representation) and video sequences (data that do not have a vector-space representation)."

When applied to text classification, these learning algorithms lead to SVMs with excellent precision but poor recall. Various relaxation approaches have been proposed to counter this problem including: asymmetric SVM learning algorithms (soft SVMs with asymmetric misclassification costs); uneven margin based learning; and thresholding. A review of these approaches is presented here. In addition, in this paper, we describe a new threshold relaxation algorithm. This approach builds on previous thresholding work based upon the beta-gamma algorithm. The proposed thresholding strategy is parameter free, relying on a process of retrofitting and cross validation to set algorithm parameters empirically, whereas our previous approach required the specification of two parameters (beta and gamma). The proposed approach is more efficient, does not require the specification of any parameters, and similarly to the parameter-based approach, boosts the performance of baseline SVMs by at least 20% for standard information retrieval measures."

                "text": "Machine learning algorithms search a space of possible hypo t eses and estimate the error of each hypotheses using a sample. Most often, the goal of classifica tion tasks is to find a hypothesis with a low true (or generalization) misclassification probabili ty (or error rate); however, only the sample (or empirical) error rate can actually be measured and minim ized. The true error rate of the returned hypothesis is unknown but can, for instance, be estimated us ing cross validation, and very general worst-case bounds can be given. This doctoral dissertation ddresses a compound of questions on error assessment and the intimately related selection of a \u201c good\u201d hypothesis language, or learning algorithm, for a given problem. In the first part of this thesis, I present a new analysis of the generalization error of the hypothesis which minimizes the empirical error within a finite hypothes is language. I present a solution which characterizes the generalization error of the apparently b est hypothesis in terms of the distribution of error rates of hypotheses in the hypothesis language. The distribution of error rates can, for any given problem, be estimated efficiently from the sample. Eff ectively, this analysis predicts how good the outcome of a learning algorithm would be without the lear ning algorithm actually having to be invoked. This immediately leads to an efficient algorithm fo r the selection of a good hypothesis language (or \u201cmodel\u201d). The analysis predicts (and thus expl ains) the shape of learning curves with a very high accuracy and thus contributes to a better underst anding of the nature of over-fitting. I study the behavior of the model selection algorithm empiric ally (in particular, in comparison to cross validation) using both artificial problems and a large scale text categorization problem. In the next step, I study in which situations performing auto matic model selection is actually beneficial; in particular, I study Occam algorithms and cross va lidation. Model selection techniques such as tree pruning, weight decay, or cross validation, are empl oyed by virtually all \u201cpractical\u201d learners and are generally believed to enhance the performance of lea rning algorithms. However, I show that this belief is equivalent to an assumption on the distributi on of problems which the learning algorithm is exposed to. I specify these distributional assumptions a nd quantify the benefit of Occam algorithms and cross validations in these situations. When the distrib utional assumptions fail, cross-validation based model selection i creasesthe generalization error of the returned hypothesis on aver age. When several distinct learners are assessed with respect to a particular problem (or one learner is assessed repeatedly with distinct parameter settings), an effect arises which is very similar to overfitting that occurs during error-minimization processes. T he lowest observed error rate is an optimistic estimate of the corresponding generalization error. I quan tify this bias. In particular, I study the bias which is imposed by repeated invocations of a learner with di stinct parameter settings when n-fold cross validation is used to estimate the error rate. I pursue an information theoretic approach which does not require the assumption that empirical error rates m asured in distinct cross validation folds are independent estimates. I discuss the implications of th ese results on the results of empirical studies which have been carried out in the past and propose an experim ental setting which leads to almost unbiased results. Finally, I address complexity issues of model selection. In model selection based learning, the learning algorithm is restricted to a (small) model, chosen by the model selection algorithm. By contrast, in the boosting setting, the hypothesis is allowed to grow dynamically, often until the hypothesis is fitted to the data. By giving new worst-case time bounds for the AdaBoost algorithm I show that in many cases the restriction to small sets of hypotheses cause s the high complexity of learning"
