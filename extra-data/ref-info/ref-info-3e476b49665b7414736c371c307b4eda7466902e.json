                "text": "A competition on recognition of online handwritten mathematical expressions is organized. Recognition of mathematical expressions has been an attractive problem for the pattern recognition community because of the presence of enormous uncertainties and ambiguities as encountered during parsing of the two-dimensional structure of expressions. The goal of this competition is to bring out a state of the art for the related research. Three labs come together to organize the event and six other research groups participated the competition. The competition defines a standard format for presenting information, provides a training set of 921 expressions and supplies the underlying grammar for understanding the content of the training data. Participants were invited to submit their recognizers which were tested with a new set of 348 expressions. Systems are evaluated based on four different aspects of the recognition problem. However, the final rating of the systems is done based on their correct expression recognition accuracies. The best expression level recognition accuracy (on the test data) shown by the competing systems is 19.83% whereas a baseline system developed by one of the organizing groups reports an accuracy 22.41% on the same data set."

Unlike the availability of handwritten characters or texts, collections of structural objects are rather scarce, thus we would like to provide them to the community. We also present the methodology and tools used for data acquisition. Finally, we report on our experiment with the automatic generation of additional samples. The process utilizes the dataset to extract statistical descriptions of symbols alignments and relative sizes."

We have designed this dataset so that, given a mathematical expression, its handwritten signal and its audio signal can be used jointly to design multimodal recognition systems. Here, we describe the different steps that allowed us to acquire this dataset, from the creation of the mathematical expression corpora (including expressions from Wikipedia pages) to the segmentation and the transcription of the collected data, via the data collection process itself. Currently, the dataset contains 4 350 on-line handwritten mathematical expressions written by 58 writers, and the corresponding audio expressions (in French) spoken by 58 speakers. The ground truth is also provided both for the handwritten expressions (as INKML files with the digital ink, the symbol segmentation, and the MATHML structure) and for the audio expressions (as XML files with the transcriptions of the spoken expressions)."

The collected database consists of 419 flowcharts labeled at the stroke and symbol levels. In addition, an isolated database of graphical and text symbols was extracted from these collected flowcharts. Then, we tackle the problem of online handwritten flowchart recognition from two different points of view. Firstly, we consider that flowcharts are correctly segmented, and we propose different classifiers to perform two tasks, text/non-text separation and graphical symbol recognition. Tested with the extracted isolated test database, we achieve up to 90% and 98% in text/non-text separation and up to 93.5% in graphical symbols recognition. Secondly, we propose a global approach to perform flowchart segmentation and recognition. For this latter, we adopt a global learning schema and a recognition architecture that considers a simultaneous segmentation and recognition. Global architecture is trained and tested directly with flowcharts. Results show the interest of such global approach, but regarding the complexity of flowchart segmentation problem, there is still lot of space to improve the global learning and recognition methods."

However, in the field of online handwritten mathematical expression recognition, datasets are quite scarce and their creation is one of the current challenging issues. In this paper, we present Express Match, a system designed to help creation and management of online mathematical expression datasets with ground-truth data. In this system, handwritten model expressions can be input and manually annotated with ground-truth data, transcriptions of these expressions can be automatically annotated by matching them to the respective models. Additional metadata can also be attached to each sample expression. To test the system, a dataset consisting of 56 model expressions and 910 sample expressions with a total of 20,010 symbols, written by 25 different writers, has been created. This dataset, as well as Express Match, will be made publicly available."

In document recognition, these target objects (e.g. symbols) are frequently comprised of multiple primitives (e.g. connected components, or strokes for online handwritten data), but current metrics do not characterize errors at the primitive level, from which object-level structure is obtained. Primitive label graphs are directed graphs defined over primitives and primitive pairs. We define new metrics obtained by Hamming distances over label graphs, which allow classification, segmentation and parsing errors to be characterized separately, or using a single measure. Recall and precision for detected objects may also be computed directly from label graphs. We illustrate the new metrics by comparing a new primitive-level evaluation to the symbol-level evaluation performed for the CROHME 2012 handwritten math recognition competition. A Python-based set of utilities for evaluating, visualizing and translating label graphs is publicly available."

The handwritten mathematical expression is preprocessed and rendered to an image. Then for each stroke, we compute three kinds of shape context features (stroke pair, local neighborhood and global shape contexts) with different scales, 21 stroke pair geometric features and symbol classification scores for the current stroke and stroke pair. The stroke pair shape context features covers the current stroke and the following stroke in time series. The local neighborhood shape context features includes the current stroke and its three nearest neighbor strokes in distance while the global shape context features covers the expression. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction. We use AdaBoost with confidence weighted predictions for classification. The method does not use any language model. To our best knowledge, there is no previous work which uses shape context features for symbol segmentation. Experiment results show the new symbol segmentation method achieves good recall and precision on the CROHME 2012 dataset."

This paper presents a general approach to creating large, ground-truthed corpora for structured sketch domains such as mathematics. In the approach, random sketch templates are generated automatically using a grammar model of the sketch domain. These templates are transcribed manually, then automatically annotated with ground-truth. The annotation procedure uses the generated sketch templates to find a matching between transcribed and generated symbols. A large, ground-truthed corpus of handwritten mathematical expressions presented in the paper illustrates the utility of the approach."

From a list of symbols with bounding boxes the system analyzes an expression in three successive passes. The Layout Pass constructs a Baseline Structure Tree (BST) describing the two-dimensional arrangement of input symbols. Reading order and operator dominance are used to allow efficient recognition of symbol layout even when symbols deviate greatly from their ideal positions. Next, the Lexical Pass produces a Lexed BST from the initial BST by grouping tokens comprised of multiple input symbols; these include decimal numbers, function names, and symbols comprised of nonoverlapping primitives such as \"=\". The Lexical Pass also labels vertical structures such as fractions and accents. The Lexed BST is translated into L/sup A/T/sub E/X. Additional processing, necessary for producing output for symbolic algebra systems, is carried out in the Expression Analysis Pass. The Lexed BST is translated into an Operator Tree, which describes the order and scope of operations in the input expression. The tree manipulations used in each pass are represented compactly using tree transformations. The compiler-like architecture of the system allows robust handling of unexpected input, increases the scalability of the system, and provides the groundwork for handling dialects of mathematical notation."

The method is robust against the recognition errors of characters and the variation of the printing styles of the documents. The outline is as follows: we first construct a network with vertices representing the characters (symbols), linked with each other by several edges with labels and costs representing the possible relations of the pair of characters. The network has multiple edges with different labels and costs representing the ambiguity of the decision of the relation of character pairs. Then, we output the spanning tree of the network with minimum cost which corresponds to the recognition result of the structure of the mathematical formula, using not only the local costs initially attached to the network but the costs reflecting global structure of the formula. The advantage of this method is that local errors of the recognition are recovered automatically by the total cost of the recognition tree."

While recognition and retrieval of textual information is fairly mature, with wide-spread availability of optical character recognition and text-based search engines, recognition and retrieval of graphics such as images, figures, tables, diagrams, and mathematical expressions are in comparatively early stages of research. This paper surveys the state of the art in recognition and retrieval of mathematical expressions, organized around four key problems in math retrieval (query construction, normalization, indexing, and relevance feedback), and four key problems in math recognition (detecting expressions, detecting and classifying symbols, analyzing symbol layout, and constructing a representation of meaning). Of special interest is the machine learning problem of jointly optimizing the component algorithms in a math recognition system, and developing effective indexing, retrieval and relevance feedback algorithms for math retrieval. Another important open problem is developing user interfaces that seamlessly integrate recognition and retrieval. Activity in these important research areas is increasing, in part because math notation provides an excellent domain for studying problems common to many document and graphics recognition and retrieval applications, and also because mature applications will likely provide substantial benefits for education, research, and mathematical literacy."

The developed system is flexible in that its grammar can be extended easily thanks to its graph grammar which eliminates the need for specifying rule precedence. It is also optimal in the sense that all possible interpretations of the expressions are expanded without making early commitments or hard decisions. In this paper, we give an overview of the whole system and describe in detail the graph grammar and the parsing process used in the system, along with some preliminary results on character, structure and expression recognition performances."
