On the page, in the context of other labeled pipe-cleaner animals, it is certainly possible to arrive at an identification of a particular (labeled) animal, for example, a giraffe. But the thesis proposed here would hold that the identifications of objects that were distinguished only by the aspect ratios of a single component type would require more time than if the representation of the object preserved its componential identity. In modeling only animals, it is likely that Marr and Nishihara capitalized on the possibility that appendages (such as legs and some necks) can often be modeled by the cylindrical forms of a pipe cleaner. By contrast, it is unlikely that a pipe-cleaner representation of a desk would have had any success. The lesson from Marr and Nishihara's demonstration, even when limited to animals, may be that an image that conveys only the axis structure and axes length is insufficient for primal access. As noted earlier, one reason not to posit a representation system based on fine quantitative detail, for example, many variations in degree of curvature, is that such absolute judgments are notoriously slow and error prone unless limited to the 7 \u00b1 2 values argued by Miller (1956). Even this modest limit is challenged when the judgments have to be executed over a brief 100ms interval (Egeth & Pachella, 1969) that is sufficient for accurate object identification."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

The results demonstrate that the perception of growth may be based on a specific set of invariant geometric relations described previously by Mark, Todd, and Shaw (1981). When observers are asked to judge which of two facial profiles looks older, they are surprisingly accurate if the profiles are related by an appropriate transformation, but their performance is no better than chance if the profiles are related by an inappropriate transformation. If, on the other hand, they are instructed to judge whether a pair of profiles is the same or different, the differences produced by the appropriate and inappropriate transformations are equally discriminable."

Treisman and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions, subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups, each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration."

This bias appears to be perceptual rather than judgmental in origin in that it was affected neither by variations in the probability of occurrence of symmetrical figures nor by familiarization with the stimuli. A characterization of the stimulus similarity space based on the shape-slant invariance hypothesis is presented, and a model which incorporates both the similarity space and the symmetry bias is proposed. The model can account for our paradoxical finding that the more asymmetrical some projected images, the more likely they will be perceived as symmetrical. This model can also account for Massaro\u2019s (1973, 1975) results on shape constancy. However, Massaro\u2019s theory was not supported in that extension in depth did not account for increased difficulty of shape judgments."

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

For example, animals can be taught to choose the smaller, or larger, of two stimuli. It is likely that the standard sizes of objects are represented conceptually for the purpose of object recognition. Presented with a box the size of my desk, I am not likely to entertain the hypothesis that it is a box of Kleenex. Underlying the feature system characterizing the dimensions are many aspects of man's representation of space; concepts like vertical and horizontal, cross-section, and spatial extent itself are reflected in many nonlinguistic sensorimotor routines (see Miller and JohnsonLaird 1976; H. H. Clark 1973). As the child learns a new spatial adjective, what aspects of its conceptual underpinnings are mapped onto it early and what aspects, if any, take years to work out? Two positions within the framework of the missing-feature theory have been held. The first position is that the child's initial mapping is between the word and the features specifying the relevant dimension of comparison. The missing feature is polarity, the direction from zero. On this view, both narrow and wide would have the incomplete lexical entry: [Adj] [comparative] [spatial extent] [-primary] [ vertical], making the two words synonyms (Donaldson and Wales 1970; H. H. Clark 1 970; E. V. Clark 1973; Klatzky et al. 1973). The two words need not have identical incomplete lexical entries simultaneously. For example, [+pole] might be added to the representation of wide before [ pole] is to narrow. In this case narrow means what wide did before"

Robert Louis Stevenson, in an essay on Talk and Talkers, uses the phrase \" flies of obvious error in the amber of truth \", and such a phrase would seem to sum up this book, since it is bound in amber paper and contains a series of twenty experiments designed to show that things are not always what they seem. Some of these experiments are complex and difficult to describe without the accompanying figures; a simple one, however, is the radial motion demonstration. In this, an illuminated white square whose size can be varied is mounted on a black background, and observed monocularly as it is moved forwards and backwards through a distance of 6 ft. in a darkened room. Different effects can be produced according to the relationship between the movement and the size of the square and it is possible-among other effects -to produce the illusion that the square is motionless when it is actually coming towards the observer. Each demonstration is fully described and is accompanied by scale drawings to show how the apparatus for producing it is made. After reading the descriptions, one is left with the hope that some enterprising physiologist with a taste for carpentry will be tempted into making at any rate some of the models, because they show in convincing fashion the bases of visual judgment. One of these models, the \" leaf room \", which was demonstrated at the 1950 International Congress, showed the distortion produced by aniseikonic lenses."

                "text": "Concepts may be organized into taxonomies varying in inclusiveness or abstraction, such as furniture, table, card table or animal, bird, robin. For taxonomies of common objects and organisms, the basic level, the level of table and bird, has been determined to be most informative (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976). Psychology, linguistics, and anthropology have produced a variety of measures of perception, behavior, and communication that converge on the basic level. Here, we present data showing that the basic level differs qualitatively from other levels in taxonomies of objects and of living things and present an explanation for why so many measures converge at that level. We have found that part terms proliferate in subjects' listings of attributes characterizing category members at the basic level, but are rarely listed at a general level. At a more specific level, fewer parts are listed, though more are judged to be true. Basic level objects are distinguished from one another by parts, but members of subordinate categories share parts and differ from one another on other attributes. Informants agree on the parts of objects, and also on relative \"goodness\" of the various parts. Perceptual salience and functional significance both appear to contribute to perceived part goodness. Names of parts frequently enjoy a duality not evident in names of other attributes; they refer at once to a particular appearance and to a particular function. We propose that part configuration underlies the various empirical operations of perception, behavior, and communication that converge at the basic level. Part configuration underlies the perceptual measures because it determines the shapes of objects to a large degree. Parts underlie the behavioral tasks because most of our behaviors is indirect toward parts of objects. Labeling appears to follow the natural breaks of perception and behavior; consequently, part configuration also underlies communication measures. Because elements of more abstract taxonomies, such as scenes and events, can also be decomposed into parts, this analysis provides a bridge to organization in other domains of knowledge. Knowledge organization by parts (partonomy) is contrasted to organization by kinds (taxonomy). Taxonomies serve to organize numerous classes of entities and to allow inference from larger sets to sets included in them. Partonomies serve to separate entities into their structural components and to organize knowledge of function by components of structure. The informativeness of the basic level may originate from the availability of inference from structure to function at that level."

Naming time increases as patterns are rotated further from the upright. With practice, however, the effect of orientation is reduced considerably. Furthermore, the reduced orientation effect with practice on a set of objects does not transfer to a new set of objects, suggesting that the acquired ability to reduce the orientation effect is specific to particular patterns. Finally, for departures in orientation from the upright between 0\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, the magnitude of the orientation effect on identification for patterns seen for the first time is equivalent to that found in a mental rotation task using the same patterns (making left/right decisions about rotated patterns). This final result suggests that novel depictions of a known class of objects may be identified by a process of mental rotation."

In all cases the curvatures of the arcs were underestimated, and the error was a decreasing exponential function of arc length. The results are consistent with the notion that tendency (efferent readiness) to perform rectilinear eye movements produces underestimation of curvature. The results discredited the explanation of the \u201cGibson normalization effect\u201d as an instance of increase in perceptual accuracy. The overestimation of curvature found in earlier studies was interpreted as resulting from an inappropriate perceptual task and uncontrolled effects of illusions of extent."

                "text": "First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence."

The results of four experiments established that each of these factors may be operative under appropriate circumstances.

The effects of the geometric variables curve radius and curve angle, as well as the influence of experimental instructions, were assessed in a factorial laboratory experiment. Subjects estimated the magnitude of curvature of a series of stimulus curves in relation to a standard view. The results showed that decreasing the curve angle led to perceptual flattening of these curves. Reductions in curve radius resulted in a paradoxical decrease in perceived curvature. Judgments of curvature were the same for uninstructed subjects and those instructed in the meaning of physical curvature. These findings are in contrast to those expected from curve geometry and highlight an illusion in perceived curvature potentially harmful for curve negotiation on the road."

                "text": "It was a misfortune of psychology that it lacked a tradition of dealing with rigorous mathematical theories when psychologists were first attracted by information theory. Applications were made with simple-minded identification of psychological concepts with communication terms, without really paying attention to the meaning of the terms in the respective areas. Quite a few experiments were reported measuring human channel capacity under various experimental conditions without asking the basic question: Does the human being comply with the definition of channel in communication engineering? It is true that, in spite of this carelessness, the bulk of experiments re~ ported demonstrated some systematic results as summarized by G. A. Miller in his concept of The Magical Number Seven. However, these experiments also led to various riddles and confusions as illustrated by Garner in Chapter 2 of this book. And this is undoubtedly the reason that many frustrated psychologists finally gave up information theory as useless to psychology. Still, after the waxing and waning of information theory in psychology, an important recognition remained: Information processing is one of the most significant functions of man. The recognition must eventually revive the application of information theory to psychology as a sheer necessity. Probably \" application\" is not a proper word. A kind of information theory must be developed which is suitable to describe as complicated aa information processing mechanism as man. A first step toward such a theory was taken by McGill in his paper published in Psychometrika in 1954. What I call a misfortune of psychology is this: Instead of taking McGill's mathematical system (called symmetric uncerlainty analysis by Garner and abbreviated here as SUA) as a conceptual tool iu analyzing psychological problems, the tradition of psychology almost forced us to see it as another statistical testing technique analogous to the analysis of variance. As such, SUA was not so handy as the analysis of variance because of the lack of known distributions, and thus SUA failed to acquire popularity. What we needed then, and need now, is a conceptual means which logically bridges information theory to psychology. So the author could not do better in entirely leaving out of the book the significance testing aspect of SUA. I t must be pointed out that SUA is not a model of human behavior. I t is a system of mathematics (or, I would rather say, of logics) so that it is infallible as far as it goes. This aspect of SUA must be clearly remembered. Information theory, developed in communication engineering, is a normative theory. It is"

With line drawings as stimuli, RTs for Condition Ps were shorter than for Condition Pv, which in turn were shorter than for Condition Pd. Visual similarity had no effect on Pd RTs. However, in Experiment II, where photographs of objects with high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) names were used, no difference was found between Conditions Ps(HF), Ps(LF) and Condition Pv(HF); and no difference occurred between Conditions Pd(HF), Pd(LF) and Condition Pv(LF), the latter set of conditions being associated with longer RTs than the former. This pattern of results was found with both a .25-sec and a 2-sec ISI. The results are discussed in terms of the levels of coding involved in processing information from picture stimuli. It is concluded that at least two levels are involved in matching photographs of real objects (an object-code level and a nonvisual semantic code level), while a third level may be used in matching tasks involving stylized line drawings (a picture-code level)."

The possible influence of these eye-movement tendencies on perception was investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, errors in perceived location of intersection in arc figures were studied varying arc-point distance and are length. Tendencies 1 and 2 accounted very well for the resultant S-shaped functions. In Experiment 2, the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion with three different oblique angles and a line-segment illusion were measured as a function of the distance between the vertex and the center of gravity of the arrowhead. Tendency 3 accounted well for the inverted-U forms of the obtained functions but not for the increase of error with increasing angle."

According to the RBC hypothesis, difficult views will be those in which the components extracted from the image are not the components (and their relations) in the representation of the object. Often such mismatches will arise from an \"accident\" of viewpoint where an image property is not correlated with the property in the three-dimensional world. For example, when the viewpoint in the image is along the axis of the major components of the object, the resultant foreshortening converts one or some of the components into surface components, such as disks and rectangles in Figure 27, which are not included in the componentia! description of the object. In addition, as illustrated in Figure 27, the surfaces may occlude otherwise diagnostic components. Consequently, the components extracted from the image will not readily match the mental representation of the object and identification will be much more difficult compared to an orientation, such as that shown in Figure 28, which does convey the components. A second condition under which viewpoint affects identifiability of a specific object arises when the orientation is simply unfamiliar, as when a sofa is viewed from below or when the top-bottom relations among the components are perturbed as when a normally upright object is inverted. Jdicoeur (1985) recently reported that naming RTs were lengthened as a function of an object's rotation away from its normally upright position."

Moreover, there is a high consistency between different individuals as to the ordering of objects in respect of their naming latencies. It is further shown that a high correlation exists between the time taken to name an object and the frequency with which its name occurs in the language as a whole, as estimated in the Thorndike-Lorge Word List.

By modal logic, I mean not only the logic of the terms \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018possible\u2019 but also the logic of all the other terms that can be studied in the same ways as they.

                "text": "\"Any adequate psychology of man must provide some way to understand the human capacity for language,\" the editors of this volume write. \"It was a belief shared by quite a few among us that developments in linguistics and psychology were leading to similar conclusions by separate routes and that this was an appropriate time to explore the implications of these apparently parallel developments for future, perhaps joint, work. This volume represents a few initial steps in the direction of that goal.\" The nine chapters of this book were written by linguists and psychologists, after extended collaboration and exchange of ideas. In the first chapter, \"A Realistic Transformational Grammar,\" Joan Bresnan (MIT) explores some of the consequences of her proposal that the role of many transformations in generative grammar should be subsumed by the lexical component. The character of lexical entries is the central topic of \"Semantic Relations Among Words,\" by George A. Miller (Rockefeller University); he reports views and suggestions that he has developed since the publication of his and Johnson-Laird's monumental Language and Perception (1976). The chapter by Eric Wanner (Rockefeller University) and Michael Maratsos (University of Minnesota), \"An ATN Approach to Comprehension,\" presents a nontransformational model of language processing that uses concepts developed in automatic parsing systems. The relations between their psychological model and Bresnan's lexical-transformational model is outlined in Chapter 1. \"Anaphora as an Approach to Pragmatics\" by Keith Stenning (University of Liverpool) explores the central problem of pragmatics: a sentence can express different meanings in different contexts. He proposes that a successful account of antecedent-anaphor relations must recognize the relation between a linguistic entity and its context, linguistic or nonlinguistic. Ray Jackendoff (Brandeis), in \"Grammar as Evidence for Conceptual Structure,\" attempts to use the information about semantic structure that is provided by the interpretation of various syntactic configurations in order to gain insights into basic attributes of human cognition. The remaining chapters deal with ways knowledge of a language is acquired and lost. In \"Language and the Brain,\" Edgar B. Zurif (Boston University Medical School) and Sheila E. Blumstein (Brown University and Boston University Medical School) survey some recent work on aphasia in the light of different theoretical models of language. Michael Maratsos, in \"New Models in Linguistics and Language Acquisition,\" inquires into the implications that a language model with restricted transformational component has for understanding of the way children acquire syntax. In \"The Child as Word Learner\" Susan Carey (MIT) examines the rapidity with which children learn words; she proposes that the process involves two stages: an almost instantaneous assignment of a new world to a field of related words, followed by a slow working out of its place in that field. Finally, Morris Halle (MIT), in \"Knowledge Unlearned and Untaught: What speakers know about the sounds of their language,\" cites facts that normal speakers of English demonstrably know but could never have been explicitly taught, nor in some cases even learned. Halle suggests this is a manifestation of innate knowledge that is genetically programmed into organisms."

The rapid increase in the amount of published experimental work has made all such books out of date, and the teacher of experimental psychology has been forced to use seriously incomplete text-books and to supplement them in his teaching by his own knowledge of the technical journals. The task of making a single volume representive of the present position of experimental psychology seemed too laborious for accomplishment. This, however, has now been done by Prof. R. S. Woodworth, and his book will be welcomed by all students of the subject.Experimental PsychologyBy Robert S. Woodworth. Pp. xi + 889. (London: Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1938.) 18s. net."

Each of these reviews concludes by examining the directions for future experiments; the subsequent article then often describes that research. The series of four articles permits the reader to get a sense of the length of time, the number of researchers, and the huge effort necessary to make significant advances. The book is written at a level which can be understood by anyone with some background in biology. It assumes very little, and most articles are self-explanatory. As Friedberg is careful to point out, this book is not meant to cover all of cancer biology rigorously or comprehensively, but instead to convey several important concepts. As such, it is an excellent, easily read volume for anyone, especially students, wishing to learn about cancer biology; it would be very useful as a fast overview of the field which will make subsequent reading of more detailed articles much easier. So well written and easy to read that it is both enjoyable and informative, this book is highly recommended to anyone interested in learning about cancer biology."

When edges in the image are parallel or coterminate we assume that the real-world edges also are parallel or coterminate, respectively. These five nonaccidental properties and the associated threedimensional inferences are described in Figure 4 (adapted from Lowe, 1984). Witkin and Tenenbaum (1983; see also Lowe, 1984) argue that the leverage provided by the nonaccidental relations for inferring a three-dimensional structure from a twodimensional image edges is so great as to pose a challenge to the effort in computational vision and perceptual psychology that assigned central importance to variation in local surface characteristics, such as luminance gradients, from which surface curvature could be determined {as in Besl & Jain, 1986). Although a surface property derived from such gradients will be invariant over some transformations, Witkin and Tenenbaum (1983) demonstrate that the suggestion of a volumetric component through the shape of the surface's silhouette can readily override the perceptual interpretation of the luminance gradient The psychological literature, summarized in the next section, provides considerable evidence supporting the assumption that these nonaccidental properties can serve as primary organizational constraints in human image interpretation."
