These parameters include such variables as position, pose, lighting, background, camera quality, and gender. While there are many applications for face recognition technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered in everyday life. The database exhibits \u201cnatural\u201d variability in factors such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database, we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version."

These query tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on text annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually-significant coefficients. We discuss three types of Photobook descriptions in detail: one that allows search based on appearance, one that uses 2-D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties. These image content descriptions can be combined with each other and with text-based descriptions to provide a sophisticated browsing and search capability. In this paper we demonstrate Photobook on databases containing images of people, video keyframes, hand tools, fish, texture swatches, and 3-D medical data."

Our method exploits the fact that the set of images of an object in fixed pose, but under all possible illumination conditions, is a convex cone in the space of images. Using a small number of training images of each face taken with different lighting directions, the shape and albedo of the face can be reconstructed. In turn, this reconstruction serves as a generative model that can be used to render (or synthesize) images of the face under novel poses and illumination conditions. The pose space is then sampled and, for each pose, the corresponding illumination cone is approximated by a low-dimensional linear subspace whose basis vectors are estimated using the generative model. Our recognition algorithm assigns to a test image the identity of the closest approximated illumination cone. Test results show that the method performs almost without error, except on the most extreme lighting directions."

Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \"Fisherface\" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases."

                "text": "Most face recognition systems assume that the geometry of the image formation process is frontal. If additional poses, beyond the frontal one, are possible, then it becomes necessary to estimate the actual imaging pose. Once a face is detected and its pose is estimated one proceeds by normalizing the face images to account for geometrical and illumination changes, possibly using information about the location and appearance of facial landmarks such as the eyes. This paper describes a novel approach for the problem of pose estimation and eye detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experimental results using frontal, and 33.75\u00b0 rotated left and right poses, respectively, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for pose estimation. The image (face) data comes from the standard FERET data base, the training set consists of 150 images equally distributed among frontal, 33.75\u00b0 rotated left and right poses, respectively, and the test set consists of 450 images again equally distributed among the three different types of poses. The accuracy observed on test data, using both polynomials of degree 3 and Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as kernel approximation functions, to determine the SVM separating hyperplanes, has been 100%. On the eye detection task, the training data consisted of 186 eye images and 186 non-eye images. SVM was tested against 200 test examples (eye and non-eye). The best generalization performance of 4% was achieved using polynomial kernels of second degree as the set of approximating functions. SVM appear to be robust classification schemes and this suggests their use for additional face recognition tasks, such as surveillance."

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner. The system has been deployed on a wide variety of platforms including Sony's Aibo pet robot, ATR's RoboVie, and CU animator, and is currently being evaluated for applications including automatic reading tutors, assessment of human-robot interaction."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Faces are detected and extracted using the fast algorithm proposed by P. Viola and M.J. Jones (2001). Detected faces are passed to a demographic (gender and ethnicity) classifier which uses the same architecture as the face detector. This demographic classifier is extremely fast, and delivers error rates slightly better than the best-known classifiers. To counter the unconstrained and noisy sensing environment, demographic information is integrated across time for each individual. Therefore, the final demographic classification combines estimates from many facial detections in order to reduce the error rate. The entire system processes 10 frames per second on an 800-MHz Intel Pentium III."

These developments are being fueled by advances in computer vision techniques, computer design, sensor design, and interest in fielding face recognition systems. Such advances hold the promise of reducing the error rate in face recognition systems by an order of magnitude over Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) 2002 results. The face recognition grand challenge (FRGC) is designed to achieve this performance goal by presenting to researchers a six-experiment challenge problem along with data corpus of 50,000 images. The data consists of 3D scans and high resolution still imagery taken under controlled and uncontrolled conditions. This paper describes the challenge problem, data corpus, and presents baseline performance and preliminary results on natural statistics of facial imagery."

The performance of SVMs (3.4% error) is shown to be superior to traditional pattern classifiers (linear, quadratic, Fisher linear discriminant, nearest-neighbor) as well as more modern techniques, such as radial basis function (RBF) classifiers and large ensemble-RBF networks. Furthermore, the difference in classification performance with low-resolution \"thumbnails\" (21/spl times/12 pixels) and the corresponding higher-resolution images (84/spl times/48 pixels) was found to be only 1%, thus demonstrating robustness and stability with respect to scale and the degree of facial detail."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

This has paved the way for a large number of new techniques and systems, and a growing interest in associated fields to support such systems. Likewise, digital imagery has expanded its horizon in many directions, resulting in an explosion in the volume of image data required to be organized. In this paper, we discuss some of the key contributions in the current decade related to image retrieval and automated image annotation, spanning 120 references. We also discuss some of the key challenges involved in the adaptation of existing image retrieval techniques to build useful systems that can handle real-world data. We conclude with a study on the trends in volume and impact of publications in the field with respect to venues/journals and sub-topics."

The method described here is implemented in a system that will process well over 109 images. The goal of this work is to create an efficient system that is both simple to implement and maintain; the methods described here are extremely fast and have straightforward implementations. We achieve 80% accuracy in sex identification with less than 10 pixel comparisons and 90% accuracy with less than 50 pixel comparisons. The best classifiers published to date use Support Vector Machines; we match their accuracies with as few as 500 comparison operations on a 20\u00d7 20 pixel image. The AdaBoost based classifiers presented here achieve over 93% accuracy; these match or surpass the accuracies of the SVM-based classifiers, and yield performance that is 50 times faster."

The facial expression is extracted from human faces by an expression classifier that is learned from boosting Haar feature based look-up-table type weak classifiers. The expression recognition system consists of three modules, face detection, facial feature landmark extraction and facial expression recognition. The implemented system can automatically recognize seven expressions in real time that include anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise. Experimental results are reported to show its potential applications in human computer interaction."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross validation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the receptive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant input features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning."

In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance"
