To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

Optimization of information capacity is constrained by the noise levels of the individual channels and by a penalty for the construction of long-range interconnections in the array. At low signal-to-noise ratios the optimal filter characteristics correspond to bound states of a Schrodinger equation in which the signal spectrum plays the role of the potential. The resulting optimal filters are remarkably similar to those observed in the mammalian visual cortex and the retinal ganglion cells of lower vertebrates. The observed scale invariance of natural images plays an essential role in this construction."

This suggestion was founded on the observation that, in computational simulation, competitive adaptation to stimuli which have the character of natural images can give rise to receptive fields that are primarily sensitive to simple oriented features. In the paper it is argued that the winner-take-all paradigm of competitive learning is not adequate to account for the distribution of responses in the domain of spatial frequency that is necessary to form a complete representation of the information contained in images. The competitive mechanism gives rise to a gross imbalance in the distribution of spatial frequency responses in favour of the lowest spatial frequencies, as a consequence of the form of the spatial frequency spectra of na..."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

Focusing on the linear cortical cells, we classify all transforms having these properties. They are given by representations of the scaling and translation group and turn out to be labeled by rational numbers (p q)/p (p, q integers). Any given (p, q) predicts a set of receptive fields that comes at different spatial locations and scales (sizes) with a bandwidth of log2 [(p q)/p] octaves and, most interestingly, with a diversity of q cell varieties. The bandwidth affects the trade-off between preservation of planar and depth relations and, we think, should be selected to match structures in natural scenes. For bandwidths between 1 and 2 octaves, which are the ones we feel provide the best matching, we find for each scale a minimum of two distinct cell types that reside next to each other and in phase quadrature, that is, differ by 90 in the phases of their receptive fields, as are found in the cortex, they resemble the even-symmetric and odd-symmetric simple cells in special cases. An interesting consequence of the representations presented here is that the pattern of activation in the cells in response to a translation or scaling of an object remains the same but merely shifts its locus from one group of cells to another. This work also provides a new understanding of color coding changes from the retina to the cortex."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

This research is concerned with four issues: (1) the effect of color on pattern recognition. (2) the measurement of statistical estimates for luminance and chrominance information in pictorial scenes, (3) the relationship between perceived changes in image sharpness resulting from changes in display modulation transfer, and (4) the development of a unified display descriptor to model the perception of both luminance and chrominance information. In this report we present the results of a series of experiments that established the relationship between our sharpness descriptor, the visual capacity, and the subjective sharpness of displayed images. The just-noticeable difference (jnd) in image sharpness was measured as a function of display bandwidth. At high spatial frequencies these measurements were found to be in excellent agreement with the assertion that display sharpness is mediated by the perceived rms gradient content of an image: a quantity proportional to the square root of the visual capacity. The addition of chrominance information to a black-and-white image was not found to appreciably affect the perception of image sharpness. Finally, the measured results on the subjective sharpness for both pictorial images and single-transition luminance edges proved to be indistinguishable. We feel that this result supports the contention that edge transitions are important in determining image sharpness in pictorial scenes."

                "text": "If a scene containing fine spatial detail is viewed at constant high photopic luminance, there are two main factors which limit the perception of the fine detail-the quality of the optics of the eye forming the image on the retina and the ability of the retina (coupled to the brain) to resolve the details of that image. In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Because of this discrete sampling it is usually assumed that the organism has no knowledge of signals beyond the Nyquist frequency. In fact, higher frequency signals are expected to mask the available lower frequency information as a result of aliasing. It has been suggested that these considerations are important in understanding, for example, the design of the receptor lattice in the mammalian fovea. We show that if the organism has knowledge of the probability distribution from which the signals are drawn, outputs from a discrete receptor array can be used to estimate signals beyond the Nyquist limit. In effect, a priori knowledge can be used to de-alias the image, and the estimated signal above the Nyquist cutoff is in fact coherent with the real signal at these high frequencies. We address initially the problem of stimulus reconstruction from a noisy receptor array responding to a Gaussian stimulus ensemble. In this case, the best reconstruction strategy is a simple linear transformation. In the more interesting (and natural) case of nongaussian stimuli, optimal reconstruction requires nonlinear operations, but the higher order correlations in the stimulus ensemble can be used to improve the estimate of super-Nyquist signals."

                "text": "Interneurons exhibiting centre-surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly\u2019s compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron\u2019s dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow & Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965)."

The ideal observer was placed at the level of photon catch in the foveal photoreceptors of a typical human eye. Daylight illumination was used. Discrimination of an original reflectance spectrum from its approximation typically reached an asymptote after three or four basis functions were used. A consideration of various factors involved in real rather than ideal performance led to the conclusion that three basis functions are necessary and probably sufficient for representing the spectral reflectance functions of natural objects."

We derive the most efficient coding strategies that achieve binocular decorrelation.

In particular, the theory predicts monocular/binocular cells as well as a family of disparity selective cells, among which one can identify cells that are tuned-zero-excitatory, near, far, and tuned inhibitory. The theory also predicts correlations between ocular dominance, cell size, orientation, and disparity selectivities.

The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved. In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

But how are the different types of cone arranged in the hexagonal mosaic of the fovea? This question has often been answered with artists' impressions5\u20137, but never with direct measurements. Staining for antibodies specific to the short-wave photopigment has revealed a sparse, semiregular array of cones8; but nothing is known about the arrangement of the more numerous long- and middle-wave cones. Are they randomly distributed, with chance aggregations of one type, as Hartridge postulated in these columns nearly 50 years ago9,10? Or do they exhibit a regular alternation, recalling the systematic mosaics seen in some non-mammalian species6,11? Or, conversely, is there positive clumping of particular cone types, as might be expected if local patches of cones were descended from a single precursor cell? We have made direct microspectrophotometric measurements of patches of foveal retina from Old World monkeys, and report here that the distribu tion of long- and middle-wave cones is locally random. These two cone types are present in almost equal numbers, and not in the ratio of 2:1 that has been postulated for the human fovea."

In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

                "text": "We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the process. In another series of experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3% was capable of nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges could be elicited directly (the central discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable variability in this value from cell to cell."

                "text": "John Dowling's The Retina, published in 1987, quickly became the most widely recognized introduction to the structure and function of retinal cells. In this Revised Edition, Dowling draws on twenty-five years of new research to produce an interdisciplinary synthesis focused on how retinal function contributes to our understanding of brain mechanisms. The retina is a part of the brain pushed out into the eye during development. It retains many characteristics of other brain regions and hence has yielded significant insights on brain mechanisms. Visual processing begins there as a result of neuronal interactions in two synaptic layers that initiate an analysis of space, color, and movement. In humans, visual signals from 126 million photoreceptors funnel down to one million ganglion cells that convey at least a dozen representations of a visual scene to higher brain regions. The Revised Edition calls attention to general principles applicable to all vertebrate retinas, while showing how the visual needs of different animals are reflected in their retinal variations. It includes completely new chapters on color vision and retinal degenerations and genetics, as well as sections on retinal development and visual pigment biochemistry, and presents the latest knowledge and theories on how the retina is organized anatomically, physiologically, and pharmacologically. The clarity of writing and illustration that made The Retina a book of choice for a quarter century among graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, vision researchers, and teachers of upper-level courses on vision is retained in Dowling's new easy-to-read Revised Edition."

Here we design an optimal signal processor which estimates the time-varying light intensity at the retina based on the rod signals. We show that the first stage of optimal signal processing involves passing the rod cell output through a linear filter with characteristics determined entirely by the rod signal and noise spectra. This filter is very general; in fact it is the first stage in any visual signal processing task at low photon flux. We identify the output of this first-stage filter with the intracellular voltage response of the bipolar cell, the first anatomical stage in retinal signal processing. From recent data on tiger salamander photoreceptors we extract the relevant spectra and make parameter-free, quantitative predictions of the bipolar cell response to a dim, diffuse flash. Agreement with experiment is essentially perfect. As far as we know this is the first successful predictive theory for neural dynamics."

The main characteristics of this approach are that it relies on the assumption that image redundancy can be efficiently captured and exploited through piecewise self-transformability on a block-wise basis, and it approximates an original image by a fractal image, obtained from a finite number of iterations of an image transformation called a fractal code. This approach is referred to as fractal block coding. The general coding-decoding system is based on the construction, for an image to be encoded, of a fractal code-a contractive image transformation for which the original image is an approximate fixed point-which, when applied iteratively on any initial image of the decoder, produces a sequence of images which converges to a fractal approximation of the original. The design of a system for the encoding of monochrome digital images at rates below 1 b/pixel is described. Ideas and extensions from the work of other researchers are presented. >"

                "text": "Recent computational models of color vision demonstrate that it is possible to achieve exact color constancy over a limited range of lights and surfaces described by linear models. The success of these computational models hinges on whether any sizable range of surface spectral reflectances can be described by a linear model with about three parameters. In the first part of this paper, I analyze two large sets of empirical surface spectral reflectances and examine three conjectures concerning constraints on surface reflectance: that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model with a small number of parameters, that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model composed of band-limited functions with a small number of parameters, and that the shape of the spectral-sensitivity curves of human vision enhance the fit between empirical surface reflectances and a linear model. I conclude that the first and second conjectures hold for the two sets of spectral reflectances analyzed but that the number of parameters required to model the spectral reflectances is five to seven, not three. A reanalysis of the empirical data that takes human visual sensitivity into account gives more promising results. The linear models derived provide excellent fits to the data with as few as three or four parameters, confirming the third conjecture. The results suggest that constraints on possible surface-reflectance functions and the \"filtering\" properties of the shapes of the spectral-sensitivity curves of photoreceptors can both contribute to color constancy. In the last part of the paper I derive the relation between the number of photoreceptor classes present in vision and the \"filtering\" properties of each class. The results of this analysis reverse a conclusion reached by Barlow: the \"filtering\" properties of human photoreceptors are consistent with a trichromatic visual system that is color constant."

This trade\u2010off between sensitivity and sharpness is analysed theoretically by calculating the information capacity of the retinal image. The analysis uses optical measurements of image sharpness made al different pupil diameters. At each luminance there is a pupil diameter that maximizes information capacity. This optimum is close to the diameter adopted under normal viewing conditions, The optimum is broad, consequently the system tolerates inaccurate adjustment. The benefits of correctly adjusting the pupil are evaluated. At low light levels the advantage is 68%, at intermediate levels it falls to around 20% but under daylight conditions it increases to 52%, These advantages suggest that the primary function of the pupillary light reflex is to maximize acuity over a wide range of luminances."

To characterize cone packing geometry, we gathered positions of cone inner segments at seven locations along four primary and two oblique meridians in an adult human retina. We generated statistical descriptors based on the distribution of distances and angles to Voronoi neighbors. Parameters of a compressed-jittered model were fit to the actual mosaic. Local anisotropies were investigated using correlograms. We find that (1) median distance between Voronoi neighbors increases with eccentricity, but the minimum distance is constant (6-8 microns) across peripheral retina; (2) the cone mosaic is least compressed and jittered at the edge of the foveal rod-free zone; (3) disorder in the foveal center resembles that described by Pum et al. (1990); (4) cone spacing is 10-15% less in one direction than in the orthogonal direction; and (5) cone spacing is greater in the radial direction (along meridians) than in the tangential direction (along lines of isoeccentricity). The nearly constant minimum distance implies that high spatial frequencies may be sampled even in peripheral retina. Local anisotropy of the cone mosaic is discussed in relation to the growth of the primate retina during development and to the orientation biases of retinal ganglion cells."

It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system."

The authors consider both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimate for image estimation and image restoration. Compound image models consist of several submodels having different characteristics along with an underlying structure model which govern transitions between these image submodels. Two different compound random field models are employed, the doubly stochastic Gaussian (DSG) random field and a compound Gauss-Markov (CGM) random field. The authors present MAP estimators for DSG and CGM random fields using simulated annealing. A fast-converging algorithm called deterministic relaxation, which, however, converges to only a locally optimal MAP estimate, is also presented as an alternative for reducing computational loading on sequential machines. For comparison purposes, the authors include results on the fixed-lag smoothing MMSE estimator for the DSG field and its suboptimal M-algorithm approximation. >"

Cells with large somata compared to their nuclei were considered ganglion cells; cells with small somata relative to their nuclei were considered displaced amacrine cells. Within the central area, ganglion cell densities reach 32,000\u2010\u201038,000 cells/mm2 in a horizontally oriented elliptical ring 0.4\u2010\u20102.0 mm from the foveal center. In peripheral retina, densities in nasal retina exceed those at corresponding eccentricities in temporal retina by more than 300%; superior exceeds inferior by 60%. Displaced amacrine cells represented 3% of the total cells in central retina and nearly 80% in the far periphery. A twofold range in the total number of ganglion cells (0.7 to 1.5 million) was largely explained by a similar range in ganglion cell density in different eyes. Cone and ganglion cell number were not correlated, and the overall cone: ganglion cell ratio ranged from 2.9 to 7.5 in different eyes. Peripheral cones and ganglion cells have different topographies, thus suggesting meridianal differences in convergence onto individual ganglion cells."

This result implies that the audio\u2010power fluctuations are correlated over all times in the same manner as \u2019\u20191/f noise\u2019\u2019 in electronic components. The frequency fluctuations of music also have a 1/f spectral density at frequencies down to the inverse of the length of the piece of music. The frequency fluctuations of English speech have a quite different behavior, with a single characteristic time of about 0.1 s, the average length of a syllable. The observations on music suggest that 1/f noise is a good choice for stochastic composition. Compositions in which the frequency and duration of each note were determined by 1/f noise sources sounded pleasing.

The second part is an account of the history (as I remember it) of work leading up to the papers in I971-1972 on the renormalization group. Finally, some of the developments since 197 1 will be summarized, and an assessment for the future given."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."

The analysis is based on the calculation of entropylike quantities as the mutual information for pairs of letters and the entropy, the mean uncertainty, per letter. We further estimate the number of different subwords of a given length n. Filtering out the contributions due to the effects of the finite length of the texts, we find correlations ranging to a few hundred letters. Scaling laws for the mutual information (decay with a power law), for the entropy per letter (decay with the inverse square root of n) and for the word numbers (stretched exponential growth with n and with a power law of the text length) were found."

We explain why fully developed turbulence is not space filling and describe how its fractal dimension can be estimated theoretically. The implications of the fractal nature of turbulence on transport processes like turbulent diffusion and on fluctuations in passive scalars are discussed. The latter affect wave propagation in turbulent media and these effects are examined. In addition we consider clouds in the atmosphere which are claimed to have fractal perimeters (or surfaces) and outline the physical reasons for this phenomenon. The fractal dimension of clouds is tied to the theory of turbulent diffusion and is computed theoretically. Indications of the road ahead are given."

After a brief overview of particle physics and a survey of relativistic wave equations and Lagrangian methods, the quantum theory of scalar and spinor fields, and then of gauge fields, is developed. The emphasis throughout is on functional methods, which have played a large part in modern field theory. The book concludes with a brief survey of 'topological' objects in field theory and, new to this edition, a chapter devoted to supersymmetry."
