A statistical analysis based on the Minimum Description Length criterion and the Maximum Likelihood Principle for the observed density function (image histogram) using a mixture of Gaussian elements, indicates the number of the different regions and their intensity properties. Then, the boundary information is determined using a probabilistic edge detector, while the region information is estimated using the Gaussian components of the mixture model. The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient-descent method where a level set approach is used to implement the resulting PDE system. According to the motion equations, the set of initial curves is propagated toward the segmentation result under the influence of boundary and region-based segmentation forces, and being constrained by a regularity force. The changes of topology are naturally handled thanks to the level set implementation, while a coupled multi-phase propagation is adopted that increases the robustness and the convergence rate by imposing the idea of mutually exclusive propagating curves. Finally, to reduce the required computational cost and the risk of convergence to local minima, a multi-scale approach is also considered. The performance of our method is demonstrated on a variety of real images."

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached. >"

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

We give computationally inexpensive algorithms for probability simulation and simulated annealing on the space of partitions with connected components of a general graph.

To achieve segmentation, we propose a hierarchical approach which at each step minimizes a cost function on the space of partitions with connected components of a graph.

They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments."

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion.

To apply these techniques, one needs, of course, a probabilistic model for some class of images or some class of structures present in images. Many models of this type have been introduced. There are stochastic models for image textures [GGGD], [ZMW], for contours in images [Mu], [GCK], for the decomposition of an image into regions [G-G], [M-S], for disparity maps, for grammatical parsing of shapes [Fu], for template matching, for speci c tasks such as face recognition [HGYGM]. The common framework for all these studies is to describe some class of images I(x; y) by means of a set of auxiliary variables fx g representing the salient structures in the images, e.g. edges, texture statistics, inferred depth values or relations, illumination features, medial axes or shape features, locations of key points such as eyes in a face, labels (as in character recognition), etc. Then i) a prior probability model for the `hidden' variables p(fx g) and ii) an imagingmodel p(Ijfx g) for I, given the hidden variables, are de ned. Finally, an image is analyzed using Bayes's rule p(fx gjI) / p(Ijfx g)p(fx g)"

The computational complexity is pronounced by the recent minimax entropy (FRAME) models which use large neighborhoods and hundreds of parameters. In this paper, we present a common framework for learning Gibbs models. We identify two key factors that determine the accuracy and speed of learning Gibbs models: The efficiency of likelihood functions and the variance in approximating partition functions using Monte Carlo integration. We propose three new algorithms. In particular, we are interested in a maximum satellite likelihood estimator, which makes use of a set of precomputed Gibbs models called \"satellites\" to approximate likelihood functions. This algorithm can approximately estimate the minimax entropy model for textures in seconds in a HP workstation. The performances of various learning algorithms are compared in our experiments."

                "text": "This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals) in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

In the independence case (in $mathbb{R}^k$) these indicate that geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if the candidate density is bounded below by a multiple of $pi$; in the symmetric case (in $mathbb{R}$ only) we show geometric convergence essentially occurs if and only if $pi$ has geometric tails. We also evaluate recently developed computable bounds on the rates of convergence in this context: examples show that these theoretical bounds can be inherently extremely conservative, although when the chain is stochastically monotone the bounds may well be effective."

It is used to extend a gradient edge detector to color images. The statistical effects of noise on the distribution of the amplitudes and directions of the vector gradient are characterized. The noise behavior of the L/sub 2/ norm of the scalar gradients is also characterized for comparison. When the attribute components are highly correlated, as is often the case in color images, use of the vector gradient shows a small gain in signal-to-noise ratio over that of the L/sub 2/ norm of the scalar gradients. This small gain may or may not be significant, depending on other measures an edge detector uses to deal with noise. >"
