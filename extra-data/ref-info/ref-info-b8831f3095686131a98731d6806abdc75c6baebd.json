Complex objects are represented as structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls, have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which implement generalized cylinder descriptions."

Its major application, to date, has been to the interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application, features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with the interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained. At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature. One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. The rules are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted."

It is argued that vision is the construction of efficient symbolic descriptions from images of the world. An important aspect of vision is therefore the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. An overall framework is suggested for extracting shape information from images, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations: (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image; (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centred representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces; and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centred description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. The critical act in formulating computational theories for processes capable of constructing these representations is the discovery of valid constraints on the way the world behaves, that provide sufficient additional information to allow recovery of the desired characteristic. Finally, once a computational theory for a process has been formulated, algorithms for implementing it may be designed, and their performance compared with that of the human visual processor."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

A model of the world is defined by a finite set of prototypes of three-dimensional objects, from which the system establishes its own knowledge about the world in the form of a \"junction dictionary\". Next the system exploits the dictionary for the prediction of missing edges in the analysis of range data originated with real three-dimensional scenes, and thus constructs concise descriptions of the scenes in terms of vertices, edges, faces and spatial relationships among them. The system is flexible in the sense that the only thing an operator has to do when the world is changed is to replace the model by a new one; the system constructs its own knowledge about the new world and utilizes it for the analysis of range data."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

It outlines both the general concepts which underlie our research and the details of KRL-0, an experimental implementation of some of these concepts. KRL is an attempt to integrate procedural knowledge with a broad base of declarative forms. These forms provide a variety of ways to express the logical structure of the knowledge, in order to give flexibility in associating procedures (for memory and reasoning) with specific pieces of knowledge, and to control the relative accessibility of different facts and descriptions. The formalism for declarative knowledge is based on structured conceptual objects with associated descriptions. These objects form a network of memory units with several different sorts of linkages, each having well-specified implications for the retrieval process. Procedures can be associated directly with the internal structure of a conceptual object. This procedural attachment allows the steps for a particular operation to be determined by characteristics of the specific entities involved. The control structure of KRL is based on the belief that the next generation of intelligent programs will integrate data-directed and goal-directed processing by using multi-processing. It provides for a priority-ordered multi-process agenda with explicit (user-provided) strategies for scheduling and resource allocation. It provides procedure directories which operate along with process frameworks to allow procedural parameterization of the fundamental system processes for building, comparing, and retrieving memory structures. Future development of KRL will include integrating procedure definition with the descriptive formalism."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

An automatic program synthesis system must combine reasoning and programming ability with a good deal of knowledge about the subject matter of the program. This ability and knowledge must be manifested both procedurally (by programs) and structurally (by choice of representation). We describe some of the reasoning and programming capabilities of a projected synthesis system. Special attention is paid to the introduction of conditional tests, loops, and instructions with side effects in the program being constructed. The ability to satisfy several interacting goals simultaneously proves to be important in many contexts. The modification of an already existing program to solve a somewhat different problem has been found to be a powerful approach. We illustrate these concepts with hand simulations of the synthesis of a number of pattern-matching programs. Some of these techniques have already been implemented, some are in the course of implementation, while others seem equivalent to well-known unsolved problems in artificial intelligence."

In general, however, trade-offs between image intensity and surface shape emerge which cannot be resolved in a single view. Existing methods for determining shape from a single view embody assumptions about surface curvature. The image Hessian matrix is introduced as a convenient viewer-centered representation of surface curvature. Properties of surface curvature are expressed as properties of the Hessian matrix. For several classes of surfaces, image analysis simplifies. This result has already been established for planar surfaces. Similar simplification is demonstrated for singly curved surfaces and for the subclass of doubly curved surfaces known as generalized cones. These studies help to delineate shape information that can be determined from object boundaries and shape information that can be determined from shading."

It is often necessary to design higher precision into the manufacturing and assembly process than is functionally needed in the final product. Production engineers must trade off between alternative ways of selecting individual tolerances in order to achieve minimum cost while preserving product integrity. This paper describes a comprehensive Monte Carlo method for systematically analysing the stochastic implications of tolerancing and related forms of imprecision. The method is illustrated by four examples, one of which is chosen from the field of assembly by computer controlled manipulators."

It also eliminates the need for proof by enumeration, inherent in some methods described earlier In the literature, which sometimes require a search through a large number of consecutive Integers. \n \nThese algorithms have been programmed and used extensively as a part of an automatic theorem proving system."

When the supporting surface of the portable support subsequently is removed from the recess at the lower surface of the center of the inflatable bed, that inflatable pad can be deflated to lower the bed patient.
