For instance, data can often be clustered in many \"plausible\" ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider \"similar.\" For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \u211dn, learns a distance metric over \u211dn that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance."

The algorithm directly maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set. It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be used for data visualization and fast classification. Unlike other methods, our classification model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction."

A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to define a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional \"images\" of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word \"bank\", to have versions close to the images of both \"river\" and \"finance\" without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts."

Our approach is motivated by a frequently encountered problem, namely, that variability in the original data representation which is not relevant to the task may interfere with retrieval and make it very difficult. Our key observation is that in real applications of image retrieval, data sometimes comes in small chunks - small subsets of images that come from the same (but unknown) class. This is the case, for example, when a query is presented via a short video clip. We call these groups chunklets, and we call the paradigm which uses chunklets for unsupervised learning adjustment learning. Within this paradigm we propose a linear scheme, which we call Relevant Component Analysis; this scheme uses the information in such chunklets to reduce irrelevant variability in the data while amplifying relevant variability. We provide results using our method on two problems: face recognition (using a database publicly available on the web), and visual surveillance (using our own data). In the latter application chunklets are obtained automatically from the data without the need of supervision."

In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab.

We propose and analyze some convergent stepsize rules to be used in conjunction with the method. These rules are similar in spirit with the efficient Armijo rule for the method of steepest descent and under mild assumptions they have the desirable property that they identify the set of active inequality constraints in a finite number of iterations. As a result the method may be converted towards the end of the process to a conjugate direction, Quasi-Newton or Newton's method and achieve the attendant superlinear convergence rate. As an example we propose a quadratically convergent combination of the method with Newton's method. Such combined methods appear to be very efficient for large scale problems with many simple constraints such as those often appearing in optimal control."

                "text": "In the words of the authors, the goal of this book was to \u201cbring together many of the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical framework.\u201d The authors have been quite successful in achieving this objective, and their work is a welcome addition to the statistics and learning literatures. Statistics has always been interdisciplinary, borrowing ideas from diverse \u008e elds and repaying the debt with contributions, both theoretical and practical, to the other intellectual disciplines. For statistical learning, this cross-fertilization is especially noticeable. This book is a valuable resource, both for the statistician needing an introduction to machine learning and related \u008e elds and for the computer scientist wishing to learn more about statistics. Statisticians will especially appreciate that it is written in their own language. The level of the book is roughly that of a second-year doctoral student in statistics, and it will be useful as a textbook for such students. In a stimulating article, Breiman (2001) argued that statistics has been focused too much on a \u201cdata modeling culture,\u201d where the model is paramount. Breiman argued instead for an \u201calgorithmic modeling culture,\u201d with emphasis on black-box types of prediction. Breiman\u2019s article is controversial, and in his discussion, Efron objects that \u201cprediction is certainly an interesting subject, but Leo\u2019s paper overstates both its role and our profession\u2019s lack of interest in it.\u201d Although I mostly agree with Efron, I worry that the courses offered by most statistics departments include little, if any, treatment of statistical learning and prediction. (Stanford, where Efron and the authors of this book teach, is an exception.) Graduate students in statistics certainly need to know more than they do now about prediction, machine learning, statistical learning, and data mining (not disjoint subjects). I hope that graduate courses covering the topics of this book will become more common in statistics curricula. Most of the book is focused on supervised learning, where one has inputs and outputs from some system and wishes to predict unknown outputs corresponding to known inputs. The methods discussed for supervised learning include linear and logistic regression; basis expansion, such as splines and wavelets; kernel techniques, such as local regression, local likelihood, and radial basis functions; neural networks; additive models; decision trees based on recursive partitioning, such as CART; and support vector machines. There is a \u008e nal chapter on unsupervised learning, including association rules, cluster analysis, self-organizing maps, principal components and curves, and independent component analysis. Many statisticians will be unfamiliar with at least some of these algorithms. Association rules are popular for mining commercial data in what is called \u201cmarket basket analysis.\u201d The aim is to discover types of products often purchased together. Such knowledge can be used to develop marketing strategies, such as store or catalog layouts. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) involve essentially constrained k-means clustering, where prototypes are mapped to a two-dimensional curved coordinate system. Independent components analysis is similar to principal components analysis and factor analysis, but it uses higher-order moments to achieve independence, not merely zero correlation between components. A strength of the book is the attempt to organize a plethora of methods into a coherent whole. The relationships among the methods are emphasized. I know of no other book that covers so much ground. Of course, with such broad coverage, it is not possible to cover any single topic in great depth, so this book will encourage further reading. Fortunately, each chapter includes bibliographic notes surveying the recent literature. These notes and the extensive references provide a good introduction to the learning literature, including much outside of statistics. The book might be more suitable as a textbook if less material were covered in greater depth; however, such a change would compromise the book\u2019s usefulness as a reference, and so I am happier with the book as it was written."
