A robust generator must be able to operate well even when pieces of knowledge are missing. It must also be robust against incomplete or inaccurate inputs. To attack these problems, we have built a hybrid generator, in which gaps in symbolic knowledge are filled by statistical methods. We describe algorithms and show experimental results. We also discuss how the hybrid generation model can be used to simplify current generators and enhance their portability, even when perfect knowledge is in principle obtainable."

The reason is that knowledge resources (lexicons, grammar rules, world models) must be painstakingly handcrafted from scratch. One of the hypotheses being tested in the PAN-GLOSS machine translation project is whether or not these resources can be semi-automatically acquired on a very large scale. \n \nThis paper focuses on the construction of a large ontology (or knowledge base, or world model) for supporting KBMT. It contains representations for some 70,000 commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods (e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another. Other methods (e.g., bilingual matching) allow a knowledge engineer to build up an index to a KB in a second language, such as Spanish or Japanese."

The program is composed of two main modules: a unifier and a linearizer. The unifier takes as input a semantic description of the text to be generated and a unification grammar, and produces as output a rich syntactic description of the text. The linearizer interprets this syntactic description and produces an English sentence. This manual includes a detailed presentation of the technique of unification grammars and a reference manual for the current implementation (FUF 5.2). Version 5.2 includes novel techniques in the unification allowing the specification of types and the expression of complete information. It also allows for procedural unification and supports sophisticated forms of control. Copyright \u00a9 1993 Michael Elhadad"

                "text": "This thesis presents new surface generation techniques that improve on both aspects of surface generation: (1) lexical choice, which consists of choosing words and their associated syntactic structures and (2) syntactic realization, which consists of combining these partial structures into grammatical sentences. The thesis investigates the impact of the pragmatic situation on surface generation. Because surface generation depends directly on many aspects of the situation, these new techniques allow a purely conceptual input to be expressed by a greater variety of linguistic forms and with more sensitivity to pragmatic factors than was previously possible. \nSpecifically, this research focuses on the impact on lexical choice of one part of the pragmatic situation: the speaker's argumentative intent, i.e., the goal of the speaker to convince the hearer of a certain conclusion. The argumentative intent can be realized by a variety of evaluative expressions appearing at various ranks in the syntactic structure. This thesis describes the selection of four classes of evaluative expressions: judgment determiners (i.e., many), scalar adjectives (i.e., difficult), connotative verbs (i.e., require, enjoy) and argumentative connectives (i.e., but, so). These four classes were not addressed in previous generators. \nThe scFUF formalism is introduced in this thesis to address the issue of complex constraint interaction arising when performing lexical choice under pragmatic constraints. scFUF is derived from Functional Unification Grammars (scFUGs), a formalism previously used for syntactic realization only. scFUF extends scFUGs by providing new mechanisms for control, for expressing hierarchical relations and for using modular knowledge sources. These extensions make scFUF capable of handling lexical choice. In addition, this thesis describes the use of scFUF to develop scSURGE, one of the largest and most widely used syntactic realization grammar available. \nFinally these new generation techniques are applied to the implementation of scADVISOR II, a question-answering system helping students to choose classes for a semester. In particular, scADVISOR II uses the increased expressive flexibility provided by these techniques to convince a student to choose different classes by presenting the same objective data, retrieved from an underlying knowledge base, in different linguistic forms using evaluative expressions."

But a frequent objection to this solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming. Many people who would like to refer to a dictionary decide not to bother with it because finding the information would interrupt their work and break their train of thought."

Despite the importance of this question to the applied NLG community, however, it has not been discussed much in the research NLG community, which I think is a pity. In this paper, I try to summarize the issues involved and recap current thinking on this topic. My goal is not to answer this question (I don\u2019t think we know enough to be able to do so), but rather to increase the visibility of this issue in the research community, in the hope of getting some input and ideas on this very important question. I conclude with a list of specific research areas I would like to see more work in, because I think they would increase the \u2018value-added\u2019 of NLG over templates."
