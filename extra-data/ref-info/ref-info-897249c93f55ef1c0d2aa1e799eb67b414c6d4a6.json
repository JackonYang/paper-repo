Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

We hypothesise that general numerical optimisation techniques result in improved performance over iterative scaling algorithms for training CRFs. Experiments run on a a subset of a well-known text chunking data set [28] confirm that this is indeed the case. This is a highly promising result, indicating that such parameter estimation techniques make CRFs a practical and efficient choice for labelling sequential data, as well as a theoretically sound and principled probabilistic framework."

We use feature selection techniques and system combination methods for improving the performance of the memory-based learner. Our approach is evaluated on standard data sets and the results are compared with that of other systems. This reveals that our approach works well for base phrase identification while its application towards recognizing embedded structures leaves some room for improvement."

A remaining problem, however, is the selection of state-transition structure for the model. This paper demonstrates that extraction accuracy strongly depends on the selection of structure, and presents an algorithm for automatically finding good structures by stochastic optimization. Our algorithm begins with a simple model and then performs hill-climbing in the space of possible structures by splitting states and gauging performance on a validation set. Experimental results show that this technique finds HMM models that almost always out-perform a fixed model, and have superior average performance across tasks."

The model combines full and partial parsing techniques to reach full grammar coverage on unseen data. The treebank annotations are used to provide partially labeled data for discriminative statistical estimation using exponential models. Disambiguation performance is evaluated by measuring matches of predicate-argument relations on two distinct test sets. On a gold standard of manually annotated f-structures for a subset of the WSJ treebank, this evaluation reaches 79% F-score. An evaluation on a gold standard of dependency relations for Brown corpus data achieves 76% F-score."

The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall."

In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201cbaseNP\u201d chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."

Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The random field models and techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches, including decision trees, are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing."

Existing algorithms for parsing and estimation require the enumeration of all of the parses of a string in order to determine the most likely one, or in order to calculate the statistics needed to estimate a grammar from a training corpus. This paper describes a graph-based dynamic programming algorithm for calculating these statistics from the packed UBG parse representations of Maxwell and Kaplan (1995) which does not require enumerating all parses. Like many graphical algorithms, the dynamic programming algorithm's complexity is worst-case exponential, but is often polynomial. The key observation is that by using Maxwell and Kaplan packed representations, the required statistics can be rewritten as either the max or the sum of a product of functions. This is exactly the kind of problem which can be solved by dynamic programming over graphical models."

For example, in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. A standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations between them. Recently, Probabilistic Relational Models, a relational version of Bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection of related entities. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds on (conditional) Markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach. First, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation of many important relational dependencies in directed models. Second, undirected models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification accuracy. We show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of multiple related entities. We provide experimental results on a webpage classification task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies."

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices."

We have evaluated the model in English (based on data from the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences [MUC-6, MUC-7] and broadcast news) and in Spanish (based on data distributed through the First Multilingual Entity Task [MET-1]), and on speech input (based on broadcast news). We report results here on standard materials only to quantify performance on data available to the community, namely, MUC-6 and MET-1. Results have been consistently better than reported by any other learning algorithm. IdentiFinder's performance is competitive with approaches based on handcrafted rules on mixed case text and superior on text where case information is not available. We also present a controlled experiment showing the effect of training set size on performance, demonstrating that as little as 100,000 words of training data is adequate to get performance around 90% on newswire. Although we present our understanding of why this algorithm performs so well on this class of problems, we believe that significant improvement in performance may still be possible."

Several smoothing methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that an ME smoothing method proposed to us by Lafferty performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. This general and efficient method involves using a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model and selecting maximum a posteriori instead of maximum likelihood parameter values. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance."

For example, the previous sentence breaks up something like this: \n \n(1) \n \n[I begin] [with an intuition]: [when I read] [a sentence], [I read it] [a chunk] [at a time] \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese chunks correspond in some way to prosodic patterns. It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks."

We propose a general statistical model for text chunking which we then convert into a classification problem. We argue that the Winnow family of algorithms is particularly suitable for solving classification problems arising from NLP applications, due to their robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for linearly non-separable data. To remedy this problem, we employ a generalization of the original Winnow method. An additional advantage of the new algorithm is that it provides reliable confidence estimates for its classification predictions. This property is required in our statistical modeling approach. We show that our system achieves state of the art performance in text chunking with less computational cost then previous systems."

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation."

Without proper education MRP II and JIT=TQC will not be successful and will not generate their true bene\u00aets. Suppliers are key to the success of MRP II and JIT=TQC. They therefore need to understand these disciplines. Purchasing in the 21st century is going to be marked by continuous changes, by who can gain the competitive edge \u00aerst, who will be the most \u0304exible and who will build the best supplier relationships. This will only be achieved by following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark, ignite change'! Only then can it happen! If you really want to know something about purchasing then this is the book to read. It is most de\u00aenitely relevant and more importantly up to date. It will certainly be a handy reference book for a course on purchasing."
