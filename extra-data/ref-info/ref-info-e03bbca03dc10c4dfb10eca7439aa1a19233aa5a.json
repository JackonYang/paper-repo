Firstly, an all-in-all labeling framework is proposed to group visual knowledge of three levels: scene level (global geometric description), object level (segmentation, sketch representation, hierarchical decomposition), and low-mid level (2.1D layered representation, object boundary attributes, curve completion, etc.). Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With this tool, we've been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748 annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

We tackle the challenging problem of tracking segmented regions by combining keypoint tracking with an advanced multiple region matching strategy, based on inclusion similarity and connected regions. We ran experiments on a 101 frame driving video sequence for which we produced the corresponding hand- labeled groundtruth. We make this valuable dataset available for the research community. We show our technique can accommodate variations in segmentation (and correct them), even in presence of multiple independent motions and partial occlusion. Results show that most of the labeled pixels can be correctly propagated even after a hundred frames. The performance of this automatic propagation mechanism over many frames can greatly reduce the user effort in the task of video object labeling."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods. \n \nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g. cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body, cow)."

We develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. These motion-based descriptors are combined with our Histogram of Oriented Gradient appearance descriptors. The resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. We validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. The combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our Test Set 1."

We introduce a novel motion descriptor based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two forms of data-based action synthesis \"do as I do\" and \"do as I say\". Results are demonstrated on ballet, tennis as well as football datasets."

We present a straight forward method to regularize the segmented regions into 2D lattice layout, so that simple grid-structure graphical models can be employed to characterize the spatial dependencies. We show how to represent the spatial context constraints in various graphical models and also present the related learning and inference algorithms. Different from most of the existing work, we specifically investigate how to combine the classification performance of discriminative learning and the representation capability of graphical models. To reliably evaluate the proposed approaches, we create a moderate scale image set with region-level ground truth. The experimental results show that (i) spatial context constraints indeed help for accurate region annotation, (ii) the approaches combining the merits of discriminative learning and context constraints perform best, (iii) image retrieval can benefit from accurate region-level annotation."

Our sole input are two video streams from a calibrated stereo rig on top of a car. From these streams, we estimate structure-from-motion (SfM) and scene geometry in real-time. In parallel, we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories. Finally, a global optimization criterion takes object-object interactions into account to arrive at accurate 3D localization and trajectory estimates for both cars and pedestrians.

The only dataset used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

In this work we propose to incorporate semantic object context as a post-processing step into any off-the-shelf object categorization model. Using a conditional random field (CRF) framework, our approach maximizes object label agreement according to contextual relevance. We compare two sources of context: one learned from training data and another queried from Google Sets. The overall performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL and MSRC datasets. Our findings conclude that incorporating context into object categorization greatly improves categorization accuracy."

In this paper, we provide a framework for placing local object detection in the context of the overall 3D scene by modeling the interdependence of objects, surface orientations, and camera viewpoint. Most object detection methods consider all scales and locations in the image as equally likely. We show that with probabilistic estimates of 3D geometry, both in terms of surfaces and world coordinates, we can put objects into perspective and model the scale and location variance in the image. Our approach reflects the cyclical nature of the problem by allowing probabilistic object hypotheses to refine geometry and vice-versa. Our framework allows painless substitution of almost any object detector and is easily extended to include other aspects of image understanding. Our results confirm the benefits of our integrated approach."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

This method, which we refer to as JSEG, consists of two independent steps: color quantization and spatial segmentation. In the first step, colors in the image are quantized to several representative classes that can be used to differentiate regions in the image. The image pixels are then replaced by their corresponding color class labels, thus forming a class-map of the image. The focus of this work is on spatial segmentation, where a criterion for \"good\" segmentation using the class-map is proposed. Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results in the \"J-image,\" in which high and low values correspond to possible boundaries and interiors of color-texture regions. A region growing method is then used to segment the image based on the multiscale J-images. A similar approach is applied to video sequences. An additional region tracking scheme is embedded into the region growing process to achieve consistent segmentation and tracking results, even for scenes with nonrigid object motion. Experiments show the robustness of the JSEG algorithm on real images and video."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully."

We extend previous min-cut based image segmentation techniques to the domain of video with four new contributions. We provide a novel painting-based user interface that allows users to easily indicate the foreground object across space and time. We introduce a hierarchical mean-shift preprocess in order to minimize the number of nodes that min-cut must operate on. Within the min-cut we also define new local cost functions to augment the global costs defined in earlier work. Finally, we extend 2D alpha matting methods designed for images to work with 3D video volumes. We demonstrate that our matting approach preserves smoothness across both space and time. Our interactive video cutout system allows users to quickly extract foreground objects from video sequences for use in a variety of applications including compositing onto new backgrounds and NPR cartoon style rendering."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

Our system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing sites."

Feature space of any nature can be processed, and as an example, color image segmentation is discussed. The segmentation is completely autonomous, only its class is chosen by the user. Thus, the same program can produce a high quality edge image, or provide, by extracting all the significant colors, a preprocessor for content-based query systems. A 512/spl times/512 color image is analyzed in less than 10 seconds on a standard workstation. Gray level images are handled as color images having only the lightness coordinate."

In order to track contours in video, the user specifies curves in two or more frames; these curves are used as keyframes by a computer-vision-based tracking algorithm. The user may interactively refine the curves and then restart the tracking algorithm. Combining computer vision with user interaction allows our system to track any sequence with significantly less effort than interpolation-based systems --- and with better reliability than \"pure\" computer vision systems. Our tracking algorithm is cast as a spacetime optimization problem that solves for time-varying curve shapes based on an input video sequence and user-specified constraints. We demonstrate our system with several rotoscoped examples. Additionally, we show how these rotoscoped contours can be used to help create cartoon animation by attaching user-drawn strokes to the tracked contours."

The goal of segmentation is to partition the image into regions with more or less homogeneous properties; but the processes which estimate these properties should be confined within individual regions. A cooperative, iterative approach to segmentation and property estimation is defined; the results of each process at a given iteration are used to adjust the other process at the next iteration. A linked pyramid structure provides a framework for this process iteration. This hierarchical structure ensures rapid convergence even with strictly local communication between pyramid nodes."
