Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

One example is the similarity between the elements from a novel source, such as a speaker, writer, or printed font. By comparing instances emitted by a source, we help ensure that similar instances are given the same label. Previous approaches have clustered instances prior to recognition. We propose a probabilistic framework that unifies similarity with prior identity and contextual information. By fusing information sources in a single model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from processing the information in separate stages and improve overall accuracy. The framework also naturally integrates dissimilarity information, which has previously been ignored. We demonstrate with an application in printed character recognition from images of signs in natural scenes."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

The key ideas are twofold. One is segmentation of character and background by local/adaptive binarization of one of Cyan/Magenta/Yellow (CMY) color planes with the maximum breadth of histogram. The other is affine-invariant grayscale character recognition using global affine transformation (GAT) correlation. In experiments, we use a total of 698 test images extracted from the public ICDAR 2003 robust OCR dataset containing images of single characters in natural scenes. In advance, we classify those images into seven groups according to the degree of image degradations and/or background complexity. On the other hand, we prepare a single-font set of 62 alphanumerics for templates. Experimental results show an average recognition rate of 70.3%, ranging from 95.5% for clear images to 24.3% for little-contrast images."

The proposed approach embeds multiresolution and multiscale edge detection, adaptive searching, color analysis, and affine rectification in a hierarchical framework for sign detection, with different emphases at each phase to handle the text in different sizes, orientations, color distributions and backgrounds. We use affine rectification to recover deformation of the text regions caused by an inappropriate camera view angle. The procedure can significantly improve text detection rate and optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy. Instead of using binary information for OCR, we extract features from an intensity image directly. We propose a local intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations, followed by a Gabor transform to obtain local features, and finally a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method for feature selection. We have applied the approach in developing a Chinese sign translation system, which can automatically detect and recognize Chinese signs as input from a camera, and translate the recognized text into English."

Based on a specific architecture of convolutional neural networks, the proposed system automatically learns how to recognize characters without making any assumptions, without applying any preprocessing or post-processing and without using tunable parameters. For this purpose, we use a training set of scene text images extracted from the ICDAR 2003 public training database. The proposed method is compared to recent character recognition techniques for scene images based on the ICDAR 2003 public samples dataset in order to contribute to the state-of-the-art method comparison efforts initiated in ICDAR 2003. Experimental results show an encouraging average recognition rate of 84.53%, ranging from 93.47% for clear images to 67.86% for seriously distorted images."

Context in document classification conventionally refers to language context, i.e., deterministic or statistical constraints on the sequence of letters in syllables or words, and on the sequence of words in phrases or sentences. We show how to exploit other types of statistical dependence, specifically the dependence between the shape features of several patterns due to the common source of the patterns within a field or a document. This type of dependence leads to field classification, where the features of some patterns may reveal useful information about the features of other patterns from the same source but not necessarily from the same class. We explore the relationship between field classification and the older concepts of unsupervised learning and adaptation. Human interaction is often more effective interspersed with algorithmic processes than only before or after the automated parts of the process. We develop a taxonomy for interaction during training and testing, and show how either human-initiated and machine-initiated interaction can lead to human and machine learning. In a section on new technologies, we discuss how new cameras and displays, web-wide access, interoperability, and essentially unlimited storage provide fertile new approaches to document analysis."

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance."

Our first method - \u201cattribute\u201d classifiers - uses binary classifiers trained to recognize the presence or absence of describable aspects of visual appearance (e.g., gender, race, and age). Our second method - \u201csimile\u201d classifiers - removes the manual labeling required for attribute classification and instead learns the similarity of faces, or regions of faces, to specific reference people. Neither method requires costly, often brittle, alignment between image pairs; yet, both methods produce compact visual descriptions, and work on real-world images. Furthermore, both the attribute and simile classifiers improve on the current state-of-the-art for the LFW data set, reducing the error rates compared to the current best by 23.92% and 26.34%, respectively, and 31.68% when combined. For further testing across pose, illumination, and expression, we introduce a new data set - termed PubFig - of real-world images of public figures (celebrities and politicians) acquired from the internet. This data set is both larger (60,000 images) and deeper (300 images per individual) than existing data sets of its kind. Finally, we present an evaluation of human performance."

This is difficult due to variations in scale, pose, lighting, background, expression, hairstyle, and glasses. In this paper we present two methods for learning robust distance measures: (a) a logistic discriminant approach which learns the metric from a set of labelled image pairs (LDML) and (b) a nearest neighbour approach which computes the probability for two images to belong to the same class (MkNN). We evaluate our approaches on the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set, a large and very challenging data set of faces from Yahoo! News. The evaluation protocol for this data set defines a restricted setting, where a fixed set of positive and negative image pairs is given, as well as an unrestricted one, where faces are labelled by their identity. We are the first to present results for the unrestricted setting, and show that our methods benefit from this richer training data, much more so than the current state-of-the-art method. Our results of 79.3% and 87.5% correct for the restricted and unrestricted setting respectively, significantly improve over the current state-of-the-art result of 78.5%. Confidence scores obtained for face identification can be used for many applications e.g. clustering or recognition from a single training example. We show that our learned metrics also improve performance for these tasks."

When scanning textsfrom a specific thematic area, conventional dictionaries oftenmiss a considerable number of tokens. Furthermore,if word frequencies are stored with the entries, these frequencieswill not properly reflect the frequencies found inthe given thematic area. Correction adequacy suffers fromthese two shortcomings. We report on a series of experimentswhere we compare (1) the use of fixed, static large-scaledictionaries (including proper names and abbreviations)with (2) the use of dynamic dictionaries retrieved viaan automated analysis of the vocabulary of web pages froma given domain, and (3) the use of mixed dictionaries. Ourexperiments, which address English and German documentcollections from a variety of fields, show that dynamic dictionariesof the above mentioned form can improve the coveragefor the given thematic area in a significant way andhelp to improve the quality of lexical postcorrection methods."

Most current classifiers perform classification by modeling class conditional densities directly or by modeling class-dependent discriminant functions. The approach described in this paper uses class-independent multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to estimate the probability that two given feature vectors are in the same class. These probability estimates are used to partition the input into separate classes in a probabilistic clustering. Classification by probabilistic clustering potentially offers greater robustness to different compositions of training and test sets than existing classification methods. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method are given for an optical character recognition (OCR) problem. The relationship of the current approach to mixture density estimation, mixture discriminant analysis, and other OCR and handwriting recognition techniques is discussed."

The analysis presented in this paper suggests an approach to OCR that is based on modeling the sample distribution as a mixture of Gaussians. Results suggest that such an approach may combine the advantages of cluster- based OCR with the performance of traditional classification algorithms."
