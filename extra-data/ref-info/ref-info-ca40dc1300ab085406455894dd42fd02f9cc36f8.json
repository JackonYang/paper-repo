In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored.This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain."

In this paper, formal definitions are given for several coherence relations, based on the operations of an inference system; that is, the relations between successive portions of a discourse are characterized in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from each. In analyzing a discourse, it is frequently the case that we would recognize it as coherent, in that it would satisfy the formal definition of some coherence relation, if only we could assume certain noun phrases to be coreferential. In such cases, we will simply assume the identity of the entities referred to, in what might be called a \u201cpetty conversational implicature,\u201d thereby solving the coherence and coreference problems simultaneously. Three examples of different kinds of reference problems are presented. In each, it is shown how the coherence of the discourse can be recognized, and how the reference problems are solved, almost as a by-product, by means of these petty conversational implicatures."

For example, in a text as simple as: \\begin{quote} Nadia showed Sue her new car. The seats were Day-Glo orange. \\end{quote} knowing that ``her'''' probably means Nadia and not Sue and that ``the seats'''' means the seats of Nadia''s new car is not a simple task. .br This thesis is an extensive review of the reference and anaphor problem, and the approaches to it that NLU systems have taken, from early systems such as STUDENT through to current discourse-oriented ones such as PAL. .br The problem is first examined in detail, and examples are given of many different types of anaphor, some of which have been ignored by previous authors. The approaches taken in traditional systems are then described and abstracted and it is shown why they were inadequate, and why discourse theme and anaphoric focus need to be taken into account. The strengths and weaknesses of current anaphora theories and approaches are evaluated. The thesis closes with a list of some remaining research problems. .br The thesis has been written so as to be as comprehensible as possible to both AI workers who know no linguistics, and linguists who have not studied artificial intelligence."

This paper is primarily concerned with the \"meaning\" (or interpretation) of such paths. We argue that they are best thought of as backbones of proofs that the terms (words) at either end of the paths exist in the story and show how viewing paths in this way naturally leads to the kinds of inferences which are normally thought to characterize \"understanding.\" In a companion paper we show how this interpretation also accomplishes much of the work normally expected in the parsing of language (noun-phrase reference, word-sense disambiguation, etc) so we only briefly touch on this topic here. Wimp has been implemented and works on all of the examples herein."

Ventola's chain-building rule was that each lexical item is \"taken back once to the nearest preceding lexically cohesive item regardless of distance\" (p. 131). In our work the related words in a chain are seen as indicating structural units of text, and hence distance between words is relevant. Ventola did not have the concept of chain returns, and transitivity was allowed up to any level. Her research was specific to the domain used. She does not discuss a computational method of determining the lexical chains. Hahn (1985) developed a text parsing system that considers lexical cohesion."
