While discriminative approaches to learning and classification have, in principle, superior performance, generative approaches provide many useful features, one of which is the ability to naturally establish explicit correspondence between model components and scene features - this, in turn, allows for the handling of missing data and unsupervised learning in clutter. We explore a hybrid generative/discriminative approach using 'Fisher kernels' by Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) which retains most of the desirable properties of generative methods, while increasing the classification performance through a discriminative setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this kernel framework can be used to combine different types of features and models into a single classifier. Our experiments, conducted on a number of popular benchmarks, show strong performance improvements over the corresponding generative approach and are competitive with the best results reported in the literature."

Compact and yet discriminative appearance-based object class models are automatically learned from a set of training images. The method is simple and extremely fast, making it suitable for many applications such as semantic image retrieval, Web search, and interactive image editing. It classifies a region according to the proportions of different visual words (clusters in feature space). The specific visual words and the typical proportions in each object are learned from a segmented training set. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: i) an optimally compact visual dictionary is learned by pair-wise merging of visual words from an initially large dictionary. The final visual words are described by GMMs. ii) A novel statistical measure of discrimination is proposed which is optimized by each merge operation. High classification accuracy is demonstrated for nine object classes on photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints. The set of test images used for validation comprise: i) photographs acquired by us, ii) images from the Web and iii) images from the recently released Pascal dataset. The proposed algorithm performs well on both texture-rich objects (e.g. grass, sky, trees) and structure-rich ones (e.g. cars, bikes, planes)"

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

An image is characterized by a set of histograms \u2013 one per class \u2013 where each histogram describes whether the image content is best modeled by the universal vocabulary or the corresponding class vocabulary. It is shown experimentally on three very different databases that this novel representation outperforms those approaches which characterize an image with a single histogram."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

In this approach images are represented as a variable sized set of local image features (keypoints). Thus, we require machine learning tools which can operate on sets of vectors. In [4] this is achieved by representing the set as a histogram over bins found by k-means. We show how this approach can be improved and generalised using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Alternatively, the set of keypoints can be represented directly as a probability density function, over which a kernel can be defined. This approach is shown to give state of the art categorisation performance."

We present and discuss results that support these hypotheses. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) automatically identifies aspects from the data with semantic meaning, producing unsupervised soft clustering. The resulting compact representation retains sufficient discriminative information for accurate object classification, and improves the classification accuracy through the use of unlabeled data when less labeled training data are available.

We present a system to classify audio files collected from the Web. The system classifies any audio file as belonging to one of three categories: speech, music and other. To classify the audio files, we use the technique of Fisher kernels. The technique as proposed by Jaakkola (1998) assumes a probabilistic generative model for the data, in our case a Gaussian mixture model. Then a discriminative classifier uses the GMM as an intermediate step to produce appropriate feature vectors. Support vector machines are our choice of discriminative classifier. We present classification results on a collection of more than 173 hours of Web audio randomly collected. We believe our results represent one of the first realistic studies of audio classification performance on found data. Our final system yielded a classification rate of 81.8%."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

The standard approach to training these kernels is to use maximum likelihood estimation. This report describes a novel approach based on maximum-margin training of both the kernel parameters and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It combines standard SVM training with a gradient-descent based kernel parameter optimisation scheme. This allows the kernel parameters to be explicitly trained for the data set and the SVM score-space. Initial results on an artificial task and the Deterding data show that such an approach can reduce classification error rates."

These methods learn classifiers that incorporate weighted sums of basis functions with sparsity-promoting priors encouraging the weight estimates to be either significantly large or exactly zero. From a learning-theoretic perspective, these methods control the capacity of the learned classifier by minimizing the number of basis functions used, resulting in better generalization. This paper presents three contributions related to learning sparse classifiers. First, we introduce a true multiclass formulation based on multinomial logistic regression. Second, by combining a bound optimization approach with a component-wise update procedure, we derive fast exact algorithms for learning sparse multiclass classifiers that scale favorably in both the number of training samples and the feature dimensionality, making them applicable even to large data sets in high-dimensional feature spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms to perform exact multinomial logistic regression with a sparsity-promoting prior. Third, we show how nontrivial generalization bounds can be derived for our classifier in the binary case. Experimental results on standard benchmark data sets attest to the accuracy, sparsity, and efficiency of the proposed methods."

Score-space kernels generalize Fisher kernels and are based on underlying generative models such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). This approach provides direct discrimination between whole sequences, in contrast with the frame-level approaches at the heart of most current systems. The resultant SVMs have a very high dimensionality since it is related to the number of parameters in the underlying generative model. To address problems that arise in the resultant optimization we introduce a technique called spherical normalization that preconditions the Hessian matrix. We have performed speaker verification experiments using the PolyVar database. The SVM system presented here reduces the relative error rates by 34% compared to a GMM likelihood ratio system."
