In order to process these texts correctly and extract the information contained within the tables, it is important to identify the presence and structure of tables. In this paper, we present a new approach that learns to recognize tables in free text, including the boundary, rows and columns of tables. When tested on Wall Street Journal news documents, our learning approach outperforms a deterministic table recognition algorithm that identifies table recognition algorithm that identifies tables based on a fixed set of conditions. Our learning approach is also more flexible and easily adaptable to texts in different domains with different table characteristics."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

                "text": "In this paper, we consider the table understanding task and present a catalogue of particular issues that arise when the tables are those found on the web. In addition, we consider what happens when processes commonly associated with web pages are applied to those bearing tables. 1 Table Understanding and the Web The ubiquity of tables, and their ability to describe relational information in a compact and immediate manner make them attractive targets for automated understanding. Recent research into the automatic location, recognition and understanding of tables has demonstrated the viability of integrating automated table processing systems into larger knowledge management applications ([8]). However, table understanding is still a relatively novel research area, one whose definition and terminology are still not fixed. It is useful to break the task down into some subtasks, and to consider them in turn with respect to the understanding of tables delivered on the web. Generally, table processing can be conceptualized as consisting of table location; table recognition; functional and structural analysis; and finally interpretation the extraction of meaningful and unambiguously structured information ([4]). We concentrate on the first two tasks in the following. location table location is the processes of spotting tables in documents. Traditionally, this task comes in two basic forms document image sourced tables ([7], [3]) and electronic text sourced tables including HTML ([1]). The problem is extended to include the spotting of tables in other document encodings such as postscript, pdf, rtf, word, etc. In general, when considering tables on the web, the appropriate HTML tags are exploited (TABLE, TH, TD, etc.). However, this is where we come to the first two distinguishing points. the presence of the TABLE tag in an HTML document does not necessarily indicate the presence of a table ([1] suggest less than 30 % of HTML TABLEs are real tables in one particular domain). there are many other ways in which tables may be presented in web delivered documents plain text (PRE), images, mixtures of table specific tags (TABLE, etc.) and tags used within the table for their functionality in terms of placing text spatially (PRE, LI, etc.) see Figure 1 for an example of such complexities. The first point requires the creation of accurate classification technology. Given any TABLE node in the HTML, the classifier must accept or reject it. Such a classifier may be built either via hand crafted rules ([1]) or using a machine learning approach. Experiments suggest that a machine learning approach using a naive bayse classifier ([9]) based on a feature set describing the set of tags below the potential TABLE node in the document tree produces adequate results. Locating tables encoded in other formats requires technology from other areas. For example, images of tables may be processed by techniques from the document image field ([2]), pre-formatted tables (using the PRE) tag may be processed using plain text table methods ([5]). However, the classification problem extends to these cases and individual classifiers must be constructed to make decisions about document elements of each type. The remaining outstanding issues relate to the mixture of encoding types (e.g. tables built out of TABLE nodes and pre-formatted elements), as well as the mixture of encoding purposes (e.g. the use of the HTML TABLE to encode surrounding text as well as an embedded table). Figure 1. A web page using a mixture of HTML tables (on the left) and images of tables (on the right). recognition table recognition is the task of segmenting the original description of the table into a relative spatial description. In general this task is required when the input is low-level, such as a document image or an electronic text. Clearly, if such tables are found on a web page, the same process is required. Again, given certain assumptions, we can take the marked up tables in a web page to be the logical spatial table. However, there are certain issues that need to be understood in order to account for certain variations: internal cell structure though tags like TH and TD may be assumed to delimit a single cell in the table, there are cases where other non-table tags are used to provide internal structure in such a way as to associate the cell\u2019s contents with those of other cells. A solution would be required to apply a certain amount of recursive processing working into the structure and building a unified abstract table. split cells in order to gain more control over the distribution of the text in a cell, authors occasionally split the text and place it in two or more adjacent cells. This problem may be accommodated by exploiting linguistic process as described in [6] where the content of the cell can be used to indicate continuity, if any, to other cells. errors spanning errors occur when the COLSPAN or ROWSPAN values are not correctly calculated. There are two cases. In the first the cell spans beyond the border of the intended table giving the cell incorrect coordinates. In the second, the span of the cell does not communicate the correct meaning of the cell. For example, a cell that is intended to span three cells below it spans only one leading to ambiguity. The first type of problem may be repaired by some form of normalization, whereas the second requires intelligent processing in order to distinguish the following two cases:"

These baseline results suggest that very simple string-based cohesion measures are not sufficient to support the extraction of tuples as we require. Future work will pursue the aim of more adequate approximations to a notional subtype/supertype definition of the relationship between value cells and label cells."

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge. It is shown that the method can be applied to partially ruled tables with some experimental results.<<ETX>>"

As an initial step toward automating access to this information, we describe in this paper an algorithmic process to automatically identify record patterns found in microfilm tables for pre-specified application domains. Our table-processing algorithm accepts an XML input file describing the individual cells of a table taken from a microfilm document, and finds for each record in the document the cells that together comprise the record. Two key features drive the algorithm: (1) geometric layout and (2) label matching with respect to a given domain-specific application ontology. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92% on our test corpus of genealogical microfilm tables."

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

In particular tables are powerful tools that allow large quantities of data to be easily understood. An automated document entry system is needed that can recognize the document layout objects and extract the information from tables. In this paper an effective table recognition method is described. The proposed method is composed of three steps: (1) document layout structure recognition (2) table layout structure recognition (3) table content recognition. To develop the table layout structure recognition step we first examined the layout structure of tables in existing documents and classified several common structures. As a result of the examination we created ten rules and designed a ruled line and box extraction algorithm based on these rules. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed in experiments. Accordingly the proposed method will greatly contribute to the creation of an automated document entry system to allow faster document recognition and permit the data in tables to be extracted."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

                "text": "Many approaches have reported that knowledge-based layout recognition methods are very successful in classifying the meaningful data from document images automatically. However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

We have developed a method for recognizing and extracting tabular data, inthis case financial tables. Tables are extracted using a version of the LR(k) parsing algorithm adapted for this purpose. Because of sloppiness in the construction of tables, somewhat less than 100% of the tables can be retrieved automatically; a method has been found to integrate the parsing algorithm into amodule analogous to a programming language debugger that allows operators to quickly correct defects in the source document. This paper describes an application in commercial use."

The presence of a table is hypothesized by searching parallel lines in the MXY tree of the page. This hypothesis is afterwards verified by locating perpendicular lines or white spaces in the region included between the parallel lines. Lastly, located tables can be merged on the basis of proximity and similarity criteria. The use of an optimization method, that relies on the definition of an appropriate table location index, allows us to identify, the optimal values of thresholds involved in the algorithm. In this way the algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maximizing the performance on an appropriate training set. The algorithm has been evaluated on two data-sets containing more than 1500 pages, and comparing its results with the tables identified by two commercial OCRs."

In this approach, block-grammars are recursively applied until a page is classified into its most significant sub-blocks. While a grammar devised for each block depends on its logical function, it is possible to formulate a generic description for all block grammars using attribute grammars. This attribute grammar formulation forms a generic framework on which this syntactic approach is based, while the attributes themselves are derived from publication-specific knowledge. The attribute extraction process and the formulation itself are covered in this paper.

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

A prototype is used for the electronic consulting of scientific papers in a digital library system named Calliope. This method operates on a roughly structured ASCII file, produced by OCR. The recognition approach operates by text labelling without using any a priori model. Labelling is based on part-of-speech tagging (PoS) which is initiated by a primary labelling of text components using some specific dictionaries. Significant tags are first grouped into homogeneous classes according to their grammar categories and then reduced in canonical forms corresponding to article fields: \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cauthors\u201d. Non-labelled tokens are integrated in one or another field by either applying PoS correction rules or using a structure model generated from well-detected articles. The designed prototype operates very well on different ToC layouts and character recognition qualities. Without manual intervention, a 96.3% rate of correct segmentation was obtained on 38 journals, including 2,020 articles, accompanied by a 93.0% rate of correct field extraction."

The method proposed in this paper enables us to easily obtain information about similar objects scattered over the WWW. We focus on the tables contained in the WWW pages and propose a method to integrate them according to the category of objects presented in each table.

Probabilistic relaxation is used as a recognition scheme to find the hierarchical structure of the logical layout. This approach, commonly used for pixels classification in image analysis, can be applied to classify text blocks into logical classes according to local compatibility with other neighboring blocks at different hierarchical levels. It provides a logical layout that is globally compatible with the training model. We have tested this approach on reading tables of contents of periodicals for documents indexing. Probabilistic relaxation has interesting properties like high-speed training and the 'a priori' recognition rate, which provides the consistency of the model according to the features used, and the samples chosen among the training set."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

These problems are manifested as combinatorial complexity of algorithms, of their computational or training requirements. The paper relates particular types of complexity problems to the roles of a priori knowledge and adaptive learning. Paradigms based on adaptive learning lead to the complexity of training procedures, while nonadaptive rule-based paradigms lead to complexity of rule systems. Model-based approaches to combining adaptivity with a priori knowledge lead to computational complexity. Arguments are presented for the Aristotelian logic being culpable for the difficulty of combining adaptivity and a priority. The potential role of the fuzzy logic in overcoming current difficulties is discussed. Current mathematical difficulties are related to philosophical debates of the past."

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

This method uses a new grammatical formalism (EPF) and an associated parser able to introduce context in segmentation. We have implemented this DMOS method to build an automatic generator of structured document recognition systems. We already produced three recognition systems by only changing the EPF grammar: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures. We present here a specific light grammar to automatically recognize quite damaged 19th century military forms. The quality of those forms is far from perfect: table lines are not well printed, paper is so thin that there are transparency problems (the forms are two-sided) but the biggest problem comes from small paper sheets hiding part of the structure. The evaluation of this system has been made onto 5268 images and the results show that the system did not make any mistake. Moreover it can recognize the entire structure in 97.2% of the forms (the other 2.8% are automatically set apart)."

We therefore propose a new generic document recognition method, called DMOS (Description and MOdification of Segmentation), that is made up of a new grammatical formalism, called EPF (Enhanced Position Formalism) and an associated parser which is able to introduce context in segmentation. We implement this method to obtain a generator of document recognition systems. This generator can automatically produce new recognition systems. It is only necessary to describe the document with an EPF grammar, which is then simply compiled. In this way, we have developed various recognition systems: one on musical scores, one on mathematical formulae and one on recursive table structures. We have also defined a specific application to damaged military forms of the 19th Century. We have been able to test the generated system on 5,000 of these military forms. This has permitted us to validate the DMOS method on a real-world application."

In this dissertation, we present a unified document image structure extraction algorithm that is probability based, where the probabilities are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements of distances between the terminal and non-terminal entities with which the algorithm works. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the on-line segmentation module. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. This approach can be uniformly apply to the construction of the document hierarchy at any level. We have implemented a text line segmentation algorithm and a text block extraction algorithm using this framework. Another example is the development of a system that detects and recognizes special symbols (Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.) on technical document pages, that are not handled by the current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. \nA large quantity of ground-truth data, varying in quality, is required in order to give an accurate measurement of the performance of an algorithm under different conditions. \nWe have constructed the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III, which contains 1600 scanned scientific/technical document image pages that come with manually edited ground-truth of entity bounding boxes and properties. Based on the ground-truth data, we can evaluate the performance of document analysis algorithms and build statistical models to characterize various types of document image structures. In this dissertation, we present a set of quantitative performance metrics for each kind of information a document image analysis technique infers. The text line and text block extraction algorithms were trained and evaluated on the UW-III database using a cross-validation method. The text line extraction algorithm identifies and segments 99.76% of text lines correctly, while the preliminary result of the text block extraction shows 91% accuracy."

Our application is focused on logical labeling in documents, which consists in assigning logical labels to text blocks. The objective is to map a set of logical tags, composing the document logical structure, to the physical text components. We build a Bayesian network model that allows this mapping using supervised learning, and without imposing a priori constraints on the document structure. The learning strategy is based partly on genetic programming tools. A prototype has been implemented, and tested on tables of contents found in periodicals and magazines."

We propose modeling the document's layout by means of attributed relational graphs, which turn out to be very effective for form registration, as well as for performing a focused search for instruction fields. This search is carried out by means of a hybrid model, where proper algorithms, based on morphological operations and connected components, are integrated with connectionist models. Experimental results are given in order to assess the actual performance of the system."

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

The thresholded profile strings are parsed using the compiler utilities Lex and Yacc. The significant document components are demarcated and identified by the recursive application of block grammars. Backtracking for error recovery and branch and bound for maximum-area labeling are implemented with Unix Shell programs. Results of the segmentation and labeling process are stored in a labeled x-y tree. It is shown that families of technical documents that share the same layout conventions can be readily analyzed. Results from experiments in which more than 20 types of document entities were identified in sample pages from two journals are presented. >"

An efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis, and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables, images, drawings, and rulers. We use the traditional bottom-up approach based on the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval, transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation, segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2550/spl times/3300 image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise."

We also report on our experiences running two simple tests involving data drawn from one such collection.

This paper presents a computer assisted document synthesis system based on the grammar-based structure analysis. The system is designed to accomplish the analysis and synthesis of table form documents cooperatively by a user and computer; namely, the user interprets the document meaning and gives the entry data to be filled in, while the computer detects the boxes formed by horizontal and vertical rules and determines the logical relations of adjacent boxes. First, the document is decomposed into a set of boxes and they are classified semi-automatically into four types: blank, insertion, indication and explanation. Then the box relations between the indication box and its associated entry one are analyzed based on the semantic and geometric knowledge defined in the document structure grammar. Finally, the system generates LATEX codes of the synthesized documents whose blank and insertion boxes are filled with the text and image data given by user. Experimental results have shown that the system analyzed successfully several kinds of table forms and yielded synthesized documents as expected."

A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract line. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a high-quality layout structure."

A new method for the logical structure extraction of form document is proposed in this paper. The algorithm of it consists of three phases: global division of the whole document, local logical structure analysis and global re- division of the whole document. GLG method emphasizes the global layout structure analysis and has higher accuracy. It is robust for treating with the accidental direct adjacent relationship between two irrelated cells. In addition, a logical structure tree is proposed to represent the logical structure of a form document."

These tables include records of cable counts, cables in service, assignment charts, and cable running and wiring lists. An interesting problem in these drawings is that the changes to the data are occasionally recorded by crossing out entries and appending the changes rather than redrawing the entire documents. The objective of the work described here is the extraction of information contained in these table structured documents to facilitate the creation of a computer database. Our software system makes use of contextual information in these drawings (e.g., a particular line pattern is used to represent repeated entries, ignore crossed-out entries, etc.). The system uses features like inter-line spacing, length of lines, line orientation, and start and end locations of the lines to detect the diagonal lines and vertical lines with demarcations. Experimental results are also included."

This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

Until recently, most researchers looking for an introduction to decision trees turned to Quinlan's seminal 1986 Machine Learning journal article [Quinlan, 1986]. In his new book, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Quinlan has put together a definitive, much needed description of his complete system, including the latest developments.

Contemporary technology for the discovery of basic textual units is based on either spatial or other content insensitive methods. However, there are many cases where knowledge of both the language and layout is required in order to establish the boundaries of the basic textual blocks. This paper describes a number of these cases and proposes the application of a general method combining knowledge about language with knowledge about the spatial arrangement of text. We claim that the comprehensive understanding of layout can only be achieved through the exploitation of layout knowledge and language knowledge in an inter-dependent manner."

The role of traditional psychophysics is considered, especially in connection with the long-running dispute concerning the relative merits of pie and bar charts. The review also discusses experiments on the perception of scatterplots and the use of multivariate displays, and points out the need for more empirical work."

One of them is intelligent form analysis. This paper describes a generic system for form dropout when the filled-in characters or symbols are either touching or crossing the form frames. We propose a method to separate these characters from form frames whose locations are unknown. Since some of the character strokes are either touching or crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: 1) localization of form frames; 2) separation of characters and form frames; and 3) reconstruction of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically located by finding long straight lines based on the block adjacency graph. Form frame separation and character reconstruction are implemented by means of this graph. The proposed system includes form structure learning and form dropout. First, a form structure-based template is automatically generated from a blank form which includes form frames, preprinted data areas and skew angle. With this form template, our system can then extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental results on three different types of forms show the performance of our system. Further, the proposed method is robust to noise and skew that is introduced during scanning."

At the core of the algorithm are the processes of filtering run lengths, assembling filtered run lengths, generating top silhouette, and thresholding the gradient of the top silhouette to extract one horizontal line at a time. The method is robust in the presence of distortion; it can tolerate significant skew and warping, both local and global, and can bridge significant breaks in lines without too many false positive lines."

In the existing performance evaluation methods, two crucial components are usually missing: 1) automatic training of algorithms with free parameters and 2) statistical and error analysis of experimental results. We use the following five-step methodology to quantitatively compare the performance of page segmentation algorithms: 1) first, we create mutually exclusive training and test data sets with groundtruth, 2) we then select a meaningful and computable performance metric, 3) an optimization procedure is then used to search automatically for the optimal parameter values of the segmentation algorithms on the training data set, 4) the segmentation algorithms are then evaluated on the test data set, and, finally, 5) a statistical and error analysis is performed to give the statistical significance of the experimental results. In particular, instead of the ad hoc and manual approach typically used in the literature for training algorithms, we pose the automatic training of algorithms as an optimization problem and use the simplex algorithm to search for the optimal parameter value. A paired-model statistical analysis and an error analysis are then conducted to provide confidence intervals for the experimental results of the algorithms. This methodology is applied to the evaluation of live page segmentation algorithms of which, three are representative research algorithms and the other two are well-known commercial products, on 978 images from the University of Washington III data set. It is found that the performance indices of the Voronoi, Docstrum, and Caere segmentation algorithms are not significantly different from each other, but they are significantly better than that of ScanSoft's segmentation algorithm, which, in turn, is significantly better than that of X-Y cut."

Examples are: use menus, no more than seven choices, maintain a consistent format, develop error responses that do not provoke anxiety [ZO] Research findings are used to support and guide the development of these and the many othrr existing prrrrpts. Although it may not be immediately apparent, such precepts arise from one basic all-encompassing guideline: An interface which is as attractive and useful as possible is modeled so that it flows in parallel with the cognitive expectations (conxious and unconscious) of the target users. The aurhors label the design of systems so they proceed and interact with the user in a manner parallel to the flow of the user's own thol$lt processes \" Cognitive I\\latch Interfaw Design \" (COMIND 151). The goal is to make the interface an extension of the user so its use requires (like a hand or an eye) no conscious attention. The user is empowered to focus his/her entire concentration on the problem at hand. Pieceby-piece investigators and designers accumulate, by means of research rxperimena, human/computer interface findings, and use these findings to build interfaces of &rr increasing user friendliness. It is expected that the culmination of these advances will be the creation of computer systems that can tailor themselves to a user's specific ps~chological/expertis~ profile. The experiment described in this article was performed within the framprvork described earlier. Although large ~luns are spent by industy for the purchase of tabular and graphic display packages, and although important decisions are regularly made based on data organized by mrans of such packages, little uncontested knowledge is availahlr concerning the relative rffcacy of tables and the various lorms of graphs.

We added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published method (Sivaramakrishnan et al., 1995). We assumed different independence relationships in two zone sets. We used an optimized binary decision tree to estimate the maximum zone content class probability in one set while using the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal solution for a zone sequence in the other set. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1,600 images drawn from the UWCDROM III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 - 18pt and font size 19 - 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. Compared with our previous work (Wang et al., 2000), it raised the accuracy rate to 98.52% from 97.53% and reduced the mean false alarm rate to 0.53% from 1.26%."

The advantage is that great improvement can be achieved in computation. In fact, once bounding boxes of connected components are obtained, the recursive X-Y cut is completed within an order of a second on Sparc-10 workstations for letter-sized document images scanned at 900 dpi resolution."

After obtaining the straight lines, Hough directions are used to detect the real segments in the image. Segments can correspond either to continuous line, or to black parts of dashed or dotted lines. So, the segments are grouped together and classified between both adjacent line crossing points. Items are located by searching the minimum cycles of the graph constructed from the line intersection points. The last step consists of verifying the line classes based on the homogeneity hypothesis of item sides."

Some documents have complicated column structures, in which some figure areas have no surrounding rectangles and others cut across text areas. In the approach presented, in order to segment documents into text and figure areas, the text areas are analyzed first, and the figure areas are then detected by analyzing information on the text areas. The overall process is as follows. First, character strings are merged into text groups by analyzing regularity in the text areas. Next, border lines of columns are detected by linking the edges of the text groups. After that, the whole page is segmented into small blocks according to the border lines. The blocks are then unified by using the column information, and some unified blocks are detected. Finally, a projection profile method is applied to the unified blocks in order to detect text areas and figure areas. This method was applied to 61 pages of Japanese technical papers and magazines, and 93.3% of the text areas and 93.2% of the figure areas were detected correctly.<<ETX>>"

However, variations in character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures have made it difficult to design a general-purpose document layout analysis algorithm for many years. The use of some parameters has therefore been unavoidable in previous methods. The authors propose a parameter-free method for segmenting the document images into maximal homogeneous regions and identifying them as texts, images, tables, and ruling lines. A pyramidal quadtree structure is constructed for multiscale analysis and a periodicity measure is suggested to find a periodical attribute of text regions for page segmentation. To obtain robust page segmentation results, a confirmation procedure using texture analysis is applied to only ambiguous regions. Based on the proposed periodicity measure, multiscale analysis, and confirmation procedure, we could develop a robust method for geometric document layout analysis independent of character font sizes, text line spacing, and document layout structures. The proposed method was experimented with the document database from the University of Washington and the MediaTeam Document Database. The results of these tests have shown that the proposed method provides more accurate results than previous ones."
