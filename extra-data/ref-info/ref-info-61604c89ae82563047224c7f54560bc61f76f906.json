We present a geometric model-driven framework for segmenting dense range data of complex 3D objects into their constituent parts in terms of surface (biquadrics) and volumetric (superquadrics) primitives, without a priori domain knowledge or stored models. Surface segmentation uses a novel local-to-global iterative regression approach of searching for the best piecewise biquadric description of the data. The region adjacency information, surface discontinuities, and global shape properties are extracted from biquadrics to guide the volumetric segmentation. Superquadric models are recovered by a global-to-local residual-driven procedure, which recursively segments the scene to derive the part-structure. A set of acceptance criteria provide the objective evaluation of intermediate descriptions and decide whether to terminate the procedure, or selectively refine the segmentation. The control module generates hypotheses about superquadric models at clusters of underestimated data and performs controlled extrapolation of part-models by shrinking the global model. Results are presented for real range images of varying complexity, including objects with occluding parts, and scenes where surface segmentation is not sufficient to guide the volumetric segmentation."

Range images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages. The first stage segments the range image into ``surface patches'' by a square error criterion clustering algorithm using surface points and associated surface normals. The second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we present in this paper."

We show that a set of superquadric models can be directly recovered from unsegmented range data, as opposed to methods which attempt the recovery of volumetric models only after the data has been pre-segmented using extensive pre-processing. The approach is based on the recover-and-select paradigm which consists of two intertwined stages: model-recovery and model-selection. At the model-recovery stage a redundant set of superquadrics is initiated in the image and allowed to grow, which involves an iterative procedure combining data classification and parameter estimation. All the recovered models are passed to the model-selection procedure where only the models resulting in the simplest overall description are selected."

Models are represented by using modal dynamics applied to volumetric primitives, which significantly improves the computational complexity of both model recovery and subsequent processing. The segmentation procedure uses two simple mechanisms: a filtering operation to produce a large set of potential object parts, followed by a quadratic integer optimization that searches among these part hypotheses to produce a maximum-likelihood estimate of the image's part structure. Once a segmentation has been produced, a volumetric description is obtained by a fitting procedure that minimizes squared error between the range measurements an the model's visible surface.

Edge maps are computed from real laser triangulation images using local operators and shadow analysis, and then structured into an edge-junction graph embedding and quantitative information. This is achieved by appealing to certain concepts of line-drawing analysis adapted to the three-dimensional nature of range imaging. The edge-oriented method is primarily useful for objects that are well-described by their edges. The main advantage of edge-based descriptions is that no fixed surface primitives are assumed. On the other hand, this scheme can only represent objects without any surface crease edges (such as a sphere) by viewpoint-dependent limb edges. This information may be insufficient for the ensuing high-level task. Thus, a generalization of the description format might include a surface analysis to provide a richer representation.<<ETX>>"

To simplify means to partition images into entities that correspond to individual regions, objects and parts in the real world and to describe those entities only in detail sufficient for performing a required task. For visual discrimination, shape is probably the most important property. After all, line drawings of scenes and objects are usually sufficient for description and subsequent recognition. In computer vision literature this partitioning of images and description of individual parts is called segmentation and shape representation. Segmentation and shape representation appear to be distinct problems and are treated as such in most computer vision systems. In this paper we try to disperse this notion and show that there is no clear division between segmentation and shape representation. Solving any one of those two problems separately is very difficult. On the other hand, if any one of the two problems is solved first, the other one becomes much easier. For example, if the image is correctly divided into parts, the subsequent shape description of those parts gets easier. The opposite is also true when the shapes of parts are known, the partitioning of the image gets simpler."

The techniques are classified based on the surface representation used, implicit versus explicit functions. A study is made of the important aspects of the surface reconstruction techniques. One aspect is the viewpoint invariance of the methods. This is an important property if object recognition is the ultimate objective. The robustness of the various methods is examined. It is determined whether the parameter estimates are biased, and the sensitivity to obscuration is addressed. The latter two aspects are particularly important for fitting functions in the implicit form. A detailed description is given of a parametric reconstruction method for three-dimensional object surfaces that involves numeric grid generation techniques and variational principle formulations. This technique is invariant to rigid motion in dimensional space. >"

Experiments performed on a variety of both real and synthetic images demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over partitioning techniques based on clustering vectors of local image attributes and standard edge-detection techniques."

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

An initial estimate of a hypothesized curve is first obtained by a statistical windowing technique. A search region is determined and iteratively grown. Edge points in the search region are tested for their goodness-of-fit to the previous estimate. The estimate is iteratively updated with the edge points that have favorable goodness-of-fit measures. The edge points having poor goodness-of-fit measures are rejected as outliers. The algorithm drives the estimate to converge to a final solution. By repeatedly applying this procedure to the edge data excluded from the previous fitting, all the underlying curves are reconstructed. The major feature that distinguishes this approach from that of others is that classifying the edge data prior to fitting is not required. Advantages of this algorithm are: (1) the fitting procedure achieves higher robustness and accuracy by dynamically analyzing the data consistency; (2) the computational complexity increases only linearly with the number of edge data; (3) the algorithm readily extends to reconstruct surfaces from range data. Thus the algorithm provides a powerful technique enabling a data-driven intermediate-level vision module to extract parametric features needed for higher-level processing. >"

Local methods are distinguished from global models by their extent of application in space and time. The local models represent procedures and parameters such as optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial resolution, bandpass filter, etc, The global models, on the other hand, characterize the overall performance and make predictions on how the individual modules interact. The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequences of steps that would minimize a loss function while still seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from focus and stereo/vergence on 2-D segmentation of an image and 3-D shape parameterization. >"

If all data points in each image window belong to the same statistical population, this practice is reasonable and fast. But, as is well known, constant coefficient window operators produce incorrect results if more than one statistical population is present within a window, for example, if a gray-level or gradient discontinuity is present. This paper shows one way to apply the theory of robust statistics to the data smoothing and derivative estimation problem. A robust window operator is demonstrated that preserves gray-level and gradient discontinuities in digital images as it smooths and estimates derivatives."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

                "text": "In the \"black box function optimization\" problem, a search strategy is required to find an extremal point of a function without knowing the structure of the function or the range of possible function values. Solving such problems efficiently requires two abilities. On the one hand, a strategy must be capable of learning while searching: It must gather global information about the space and concentrate the search in the most promising regions. On the other hand, a strategy must be capable of sustained exploration: If a search of the most promising region does not uncover a satisfactory point, the strategy must redirect its efforts into other regions of the space. \nThis dissertation describes a connectionist learning machine that produces a search strategy called stochastic iterated genetic hillclimbing (SIGH). Viewed over a short period of time, SIGH displays a coarse-to-fine searching strategy, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. However, in SIGH the convergence process is reversible. The connectionist implementation makes it possible to diverge the search after it has converged, and to recover coarse-grained information about the space that was suppressed during convergence. The successful optimization of a complex function by SIGH usually involves a series of such converge/diverge cycles. \nSIGH can be viewed as a generalization of a genetic algorithm and a stochastic hillclimbing algorithm, in which genetic search discovers starting points for subsequent hillclimbing, and hillclimbing biases the population for subsequent genetic search. Several search stratgies--including SIGH, hillclimbers, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing--are tested on a set of illustrative functions and on a series of graph partitioning problems. SIGH is competitive with genetic algorithms and simulated annealing in most cases, and markedly superior in a function where the uphill directions usually lead away from the global maximum. In that case, SIGH's ability to pass information from one coarse-to-fine search to the next is crucial. Combinations of genetic and hillclimbing techniques can offer dramatic performance improvements over either technique alone."

We address in particular aspects of the dichotomy between the preattentive-parallel and the attentive-serial modes of visual perception and their hypothetical neuronal implementations. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from this early representation into a more central representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the {\\it selected} location. (3) We discuss some selection rules that determine which location will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the saliency or conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. A hierarchical pyramid--like architecture is proposed for this network. We suggest possible implementations in neuronal hardware, including a possible role for the extensive back-projection form the cortex to the LGN."

We call the representation the Curvature Primal Sketch because of the close analogy to the primal sketch representation advocated by Marr for describing significant intensity changes. We define a set of primitive parameterized curvature discontinuities, and derive expressions for their convolutions with the first and second derivatives of a Gaussian. We describe an implemented algorithm that computes the Curvature Primal Sketch by matching the multiscale convolutions of a shape, and illustrate its performance on a set of tool shapes. Several applications of the representation are sketched."

The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing."

A critical point configuration graph (CPCG) is derived from the critical points, ridge lines, and course lines of the function. Then a result from the theory of critical points of Morse functions is applied to obtain several constraints on the number and type of critical points that appear on cycles of a CPCG. These constraints yield a catalog of equivalent CPCG cycles containing four entries. The slope districts induced by a critical point configuration graph appear useful for describing the behavior of smooth functions of two variables, such as surfaces, images, and the radius function of three-dimensional symmetric axes."

A critical point configuration graph (CPCG) is derived from the critical points, ridge lines, and course lines of the function. Then a result from the theory of critical points of Morse functions is applied to obtain several constraints on the number and type of critical points that appear on cycles of a CPCG. These constraints yield a catalog of equivalent CPCG cycles containing four entries. The slope districts induced by a critical point configuration graph appear useful for describing the behavior of smooth functions of two variables, such as surfaces, images, and the radius function of tbree-dimensional symmetric axes."
