This royalty-free collection provides additional evaluation data for ImageCLEF, and in particular provides a new collection for the ad-hoc retrieval task over the existing St. Andrews historic photographic collection. This new image benchmark (referred to as IAPR Benchmark), has grown out of an initiative started by the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and consists of approximately 25,000 images from a personal photographic collection provided by the lead author. The construction and composition of this unique image collection are described in this paper, together with information on expected use of this image collection in future ImageCLEF tasks."

The only dataset used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

Unfortunately, we have very little evidence of the usefulness of these algorithms in real user needs and contexts. In this paper, we introduce a test collection for the evaluation of CBIR algorithms. In the test collection, the performance testing is based on photograph similarity perceived by end-users in the context of realistic illustration tasks and environment. The building process and the characteristics of the resulting test collection are outlined, including a typology of similarity criteria expressed by the subjects judging the similarity of photographs. A small-scale study on the consistency of similarity assessments is presented. A case evaluation of two CBIR algorithms is reported. The results show clear correlation between the subjects' similarity assessments and the functioning of feature parameters of the tested algorithms."

Now beginning its fourth year, TRECVID aims over time to develop both a better understanding of how systems can effectively accomplish video retrieval and how one can reliably benchmark their performance. This paper is a case study in the development of video retrieval systems and their evaluation as well as a report on the TRECVID status to-date. After an introduction to the evolution of TRECVID over the past 3 years, we report on the most recent evaluation TRECVID 2003 in terms of the 4 tasks (shot boundary determination, high-level feature extraction, story segmentation and classification, search), the data (133 hours of US television news), the measures, the results obtained, and the approaches taken by some of the 24 participating groups."

While different systems clearly have their particular strengths, they tend to use different collections to highlight the advantages of their algorithms. Consequently, a degree of bias may exist, and it also makes it difficult to make comparisons concerning the relative superiority of different algorithms. In order for the field of visual information search to make further progress, a need therefore exists for a standardised benchmark suite to be developed. By having a uniform measure of search performance, research progress can be more easily recognised and charted, and the resultant synergy will be essential to further development of the field. This paper presents concrete proposals concerning the development of such a benchmark, and by adopting an extensible framework, it is able to cater for a wide variety of applications paradigms and to lend itself to incremental refinement."

Four tasks were offered in ImageCLEF: ad\u2013hoc retrieval from an historic photographic collection, ad\u2013hoc retrieval from a medical collection, an automatic image annotation task, and a user\u2013centered (interactive) evaluation task. 24 research groups from a variety of backgrounds and nationalities (14 countries) participated in ImageCLEF.

While the CBIR community is beginning to realize the need for higher-level \u201csemantic\u201d retrieval, and the LIS community has experimented with integrating CBR into some systems, littl e continuing collaboration exists. An image testbed could bring researchers from these two and other relevant disciplines together, encouraging research and system development aimed toward the use of appropriate tools at appropriate levels. A large number of images from diverse domains are needed to adequately test various mechanisms for indexing, storage, retrieval, manipulation, migration, preservation, etc. By providing a tool which is of criti cal interest to these communities, advances in both intellectual and machine technologies will be stimulated.

The process starts form a source language indexed image. CBIR is proposed as a means to find similar images in target language documents in the web. The text surrounding the target matched image is chunked and the chunks are classified into concrete and abstract nouns by means of a discriminant analysis. The number of images retrieved by each chunk and the edit distance between each chunk and each image file name are taken as differentiating variables; a 74.4% rate of correctly classified labeled examples shows the adequacy of these variables. Nouns classified as concrete are used to retrieve images from the web and each retrieved image is compared with the image in the target document. When a positive matching occurs, the chunk used to retrieve the matched image is assigned as the index for the image in the target document and as the target language equivalent for the source image index. As the experiments are carried out in specialized domains, a systematic and recursive use of the approach is used to build terminological glossaries by storing images with their respective cross-language indices."
