                "text": "Finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of a discrete-state distribution specified by a graphical model requires solving an integer program. The max-product algorithm, also known as the max-plus or min-sum algorithm, is an iterative method for (approximately) solving such a problem on graphs with cycles. We provide a novel perspective on the algorithm, which is based on the idea of reparameterizing the distribution in terms of so-called pseudo-max-marginals on nodes and edges of the graph. This viewpoint provides conceptual insight into the max-product algorithm in application to graphs with cycles. First, we prove the existence of max-product fixed points for positive distributions on arbitrary graphs. Next, we show that the approximate max-marginals computed by max-product are guaranteed to be consistent, in a suitable sense to be defined, over every tree of the graph. We then turn to characterizing the nature of the approximation to the MAP assignment computed by max-product. We generalize previous work by showing that for any graph, the max-product assignment satisfies a particular optimality condition with respect to any subgraph containing at most one cycle per connected component. We use this optimality condition to derive upper bounds on the difference between the log probability of the true MAP assignment, and the log probability of a max-product assignment. Finally, we consider extensions of the max-product algorithm that operate over higher-order cliques, and show how our reparameterization analysis extends in a natural manner."

                "text": "Graphical models provide a powerful general framework for encoding the structure of large-scale estimation problems. However, the graphs describing typical real-world phenomena contain many cycles, making direct estimation procedures prohibitively costly. In this paper, we develop an iterative inference algorithm for general Gaussian graphical models. It operates by exactly solving a series of modified estimation problems on spanning trees embedded within the original cyclic graph. When these subproblems are suitably chosen, the algorithm converges to the correct conditional means. Moreover, and in contrast to many other iterative methods, the tree-based procedures we propose can also be used to calculate exact error variances. Although the conditional mean iteration is effective for quite densely connected graphical models, the error variance computation is most efficient for sparser graphs. In this context, we present a modeling example suggesting that very sparsely connected graphs with cycles may provide significant advantages relative to their tree-structured counterparts, thanks both to the expressive power of these models and to the efficient inference algorithms developed herein. The convergence properties of the proposed tree-based iterations are characterized both analytically and experimentally. In addition, by using the basic tree-based iteration to precondition the conjugate gradient method, we develop an alternative, accelerated iteration that is finitely convergent. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate this algorithm's effectiveness on several inference problems, including a prototype distributed sensing application."

By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity."

This quantity plays an important role in various contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation, combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds. Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry: in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain, and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants."

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

In this paper we investigate the behavior of an PPA in graphs with a single cycle such as the graph of a tail-biting code. First, we show that for strictly positive local kernels, the iterations of the PPA converge to a unique fixed point, (which was also observed by Anderson and Hladik (1998) and Weiss (1997)). Secondly, we shall generalize a result of McEliece and Rodemich (1995), by showing that if the hidden variables in the cycle are binary-valued, the PPA will always make an optimal decision. (This was also observed independently by Weiss). When the hidden variables can assume 3 or more values, the behavior of the PPA is much harder to characterize."

Hammersley and Clifford [3] proved the same result for the more general case when the domain is the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and the number of possible states for each site is finite. In order to show this, they extended the notion of a Gibbs ensemble to embrace more complex interactions than occur on the cubic lattice. Their method was circuitous and showed merely the existence of a potential function for a Markov field with little indication of its form. In [4], Preston gives a more direct approach to the two-state problem and presents an explicit formula for the potential. We show here that the equivalence of Markov fields and Gibbs ensembles follows immediately from a very simple application of the Mobius inversion theorem of [5] which allows us to construct a natural expression for the potential function of a Markov field. We confine our attention to the set of sites of an arbitrary finite graph and allow each site to be in any one of a countable set of states. The two-state solution of Preston emerges as a corollary."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

Local belief propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of Turbo codes, whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

Institute of Mathematical Statistics is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to The Annals of Probability. Some geometric properties of PD's are established, Kullback's I-divergence playing the role of squared Euclidean distance. The minimum discrimination information problem is viewed as that of projecting a PD onto a convex set of PD's and useful existence theorems for and characterizations of the minimizing PD are arrived at. A natural generalization of known iterative algorithms converging to the minimizing PD in special situations is given; even for those special cases, our convergence proof is more generally valid than those previously published. As corollaries of independent interest, generalizations of known results on the existence of PD's or nonnegative matrices of a certain form are obtained.

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabilities at each unit, using an analytic expression. Next, we update the marginal probabilities, by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions as our belief optimization method. The stable nature of belief optimization makes it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data."

                "text": "It was shown recently in [1] that there is a close connection between the belief propagation algorithm and certain approximations to the variational free energy in statistical physics. Specifically, the fixed points of the belief propagation algorithm are shown to coincide with the stationary points of the Bethe\u2019s approximate free energy subject to consistency constraints. Bethe\u2019s approximation is known as a special case of a general class of approximations called Kikuchi free energy approximations. A general class of belief propagation algorithms was also introduced in [1], which attempts to find the stationary points of a general Kikuchi free energy functional. In this paper we first examine the physical significance of the \u2018free energy\u2019 functions, and review the general Kikuchi approximations using M\u00f6bius inversion formula. Next we define a general constrained minimization problem corresponding to the general Kikuchi approximation whose stationary points approximate marginals of a product function, and we specify a general class of local message passing algorithms along the edges of the Hasse diagram of the collection of Kikuchi regions, which attempt to solve that problem. We further give sufficient conditions under which a Kikuchi functional has a unique minimum, and/or closely approximates the exact free energy. These directly translate to conditions for the convergence and correctness of the belief propagation algorithm. I. Free Energy and Kikuchi Approximation Consider a system with N distinct and fixed sites. Attached to each site i is an elementary magnet which can take a spin value si from the set A of possible spins. Denote by s = (s1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sN ) the configuration of the system. Then, under fundamental assumptions of thermal physics, it can be shown that if the system is in thermal equilibrium with a large reservoir, the probability that the system will be in a configuration s is given by the Boltzmann distribution:"

In this context, we are able to show that, under certain conditions, the algorithm converges and that-somewhat surprisingly-though the density generated by belief propagation may differ significantly from the desired posterior density, the means of these two densities coincide. Since computation of posterior distributions is tractable when densities are Gaussian, use of belief propagation in such a setting may appear unwarranted. Indeed, our primary motivation for studying belief propagation in this context stems from a desire to enhance our understanding of the algorithm's dynamics in a non-Gaussian setting, and to gain insights into its excellent performance in turbo codes. Nevertheless, even when the densities are Gaussian, belief propagation may sometimes provide a more efficient alternative to traditional inference methods."

We explain the principles behind the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, which is an efficient way to solve inference problems based on passing local messages. We develop a unified approach, with examples, notation, and graphical models borrowed from the relevant disciplines.We explain the close connection between the BP algorithm and the Bethe approximation of statistical physics. In particular, we show that BP can only converge to a fixed point that is also a stationary point of the Bethe approximation to the free energy. This result helps explaining the successes of the BP algorithm and enables connections to be made with variational approaches to approximate inference.The connection of BP with the Bethe approximation also suggests a way to construct new message-passing algorithms based on improvements to Bethe's approximation introduced Kikuchi and others. The new generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms are significantly more accurate than ordinary BP for some problems. We illustrate how to construct GBP algorithms with a detailed example."

After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

PBP is an iterative message-passing algorithm for solving, either exactly or approximately, the marginalized product density problem, which is a general computational problem of wide applicability. We will show that PBP can be thought of as an algorithm for minimizing a certain \u201cfree energy\u201d function, and by exploiting this interpretation, we will exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the fixed points of PBP and the stationary points of the free energy."

The dualistic structures of the exponential families and curved exponential families are elucidated from the geometrical viewpoint. The duality connected by the Legendre transformation is thus extended to include two kinds of affine connections and two kinds of curvatures. The second-order information loss is calculated for Fisher-efficient estimators, and is decomposed into the sum of two non-negative terms. One is related to the exponential curvature of the statistical model and the other is related to the mixture curvature of the estimator. Only the latter term depends on the estimator, and vanishes for the maximum-likelihood estimator. A set of statistics which recover the second-order information loss are given. The second-order efficiency also is obtained. The differential geometry of the function space of distributions is discussed."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

A natural framework for developing such a theory is the study of stochastic processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in which different depths in the tree or lattice correspond to different spatial scales in representing a signal or image. In particular, it is shown how the wavelet transform directly suggests such a modeling paradigm. This perspective then leads directly to the investigation of several classes of dynamic models and related notions of multiscale stationarity in which scale plays the role of a time-like variable. The investigation of models on homogeneous trees is emphasized. The framework examined here allows for consideration, in a very natural way, of the fusion of data from sensors with differing resolutions. Also, thanks to the fact that wavelet transforms do an excellent job of 'compressing' large classes of covariance kernels, it is seen that these modeling paradigms appear to have promise in a far broader context than one might expect. >"

This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

Using tools from the theory of Gibbs measures we develop easily testable sufficient conditions for convergence.

Sections B and C cover the approximations already known, such as those of Bethe (Sec. B) and of Kramers-Wannier (Sec. C), which are shown to be derived as special cases of the method with suitable choices of variables. In Sec. D, an improved treatment is explained for the three-dimensional simple cubic Ising lattice. This approximation is found to agree with the rigorous expansion of the partition function up to the fourth moment by Kirkwood's moment method, so far as the disordered state is concerned. In Sec. E the general formula for the entropy is given. In Sec. H an improved treatment of the face-centered lattice (Ising model) is given."

A considerable amount of research has simplified, formalized, and extended the ideas inherent in the original turbo code construction. Nevertheless, the nature of the relatively simple ad hoc turbo-decoding algorithm has remained something of a mystery. We present a geometric interpretation of the turbo-decoding algorithm. The geometric perspective clearly indicates the relationship between turbo-decoding and maximum-likelihood decoding. Analysis of the geometry leads to new results concerning existence of fixed points, conditions for uniqueness, conditions for stability, and proximity to maximum-likelihood decoding."

The set of all the Boltzmann machines with a fixed topology forms a geometric manifold of high dimension, where modifiable synaptic weights of connections play the role of a coordinate system to specify networks. A learning trajectory, for example, is a curve in this manifold. It is important to study the geometry of the neural manifold, rather than the behavior of a single network, in order to know the capabilities and limitations of neural networks of a fixed topology. Using the new theory of information geometry, a natural invariant Riemannian metric and a dual pair of affine connections on the Boltzmann neural network manifold are established. The meaning of geometrical structures is elucidated from the stochastic and the statistical point of view. This leads to a natural modification of the Boltzmann machine learning rule."

We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified.

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound."
