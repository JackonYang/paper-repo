The system can reliably detect upright pedestrians to a range of 40 m in lightly cluttered urban environments. The system uses range data from stereo vision to segment the scene into regions of interest, from which shape features are extracted and used to classify pedestrians. The regions are tracked using shape and appearance features. Tracking is used to temporally filter classifications to improve performance and to estimate the velocity of pedestrians for use in path planning. The end-to-end system runs at 5 Hz on 1,024 \u00d7 768 imagery using a standard 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Quad processor, and has been integrated and tested on multiple ground vehicles and environments. We show performance on a diverse set of datasets with groundtruth in outdoor environments with varying degrees of pedestrian density and clutter. In highly cluttered urban environments, the detection rates are on a par with state-of-the-art but significantly slower systems."

Dense disparity maps allow an accurate estimation of the camera height, pitch angle and vertical road profile, which in turn enables a more precise specification of the areas on the ground where pedestrians are to be expected. An experimental comparison between sparse and dense stereo approaches is carried out on image data captured in complex urban environments (i.e. undulating roads, speed bumps). The ROI generation stage, based on dense stereo and specific camera and road parameter estimation, results in a detection performance improvement of factor five over the state-of-the-art based on ROI generation by sparse stereo. Interestingly, the added processing cost of computing dense disparity maps is at least partially amortized by the fewer ROIs that need to be processed at the system level."

In recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. In particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians."

The computational bottleneck of many modern detectors is the construction of an image pyramid, typically sampled at 8-16 scales per octave, and associated feature computations at each scale. We propose a technique to avoid constructing such a finely sampled image pyramid without sacrificing performance: our key insight is that for a broad family of features, including gradient histograms, the feature responses computed at a single scale can be used to approximate feature responses at nearby scales. The approximation is accurate within an entire scale octave. This allows us to decouple the sampling of the image pyramid from the sampling of detection scales. Overall, our approximation yields a speedup of 10-100 times over competing methods with only a minor loss in detection accuracy of about 1-2% on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset across a wide range of evaluation settings. The results are confirmed on three additional datasets (INRIA, ETH, and TUD-Brussels) where our method always scores within a few percent of the state-of-the-art while being 1-2 orders of magnitude faster. The approach is general and should be widely applicable."

We develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. These motion-based descriptors are combined with our Histogram of Oriented Gradient appearance descriptors. The resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. We validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. The combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our Test Set 1."

                "text": "In recent years, interest in mobile robots and intelligent vehicles that are able to act autonomously in scenarios of daily human living has been increasing constantly. This trend has been further fostered by advances in input sensor technology such as cameras or lasers, as well as in the corresponding algorithms for data interpretation. Due to their relatively low price and similarity to human vision, cameras are an especially intriguing sensor for such tasks. This dissertation presents a purely vision-based system for the tasks of self-localization, scene analysis, and object tracking in semi-crowded urban environments, with a mobile platform as observer. Starting from a set of off-the-shelf components for object detection and stereo depth estimation, we first propose a probabilistic combination of these independent cues to simultaneously validate object hypotheses and estimate a common ground plane where these objects reside. Based on the the improved detections and self-localization from visual odometry, we then introduce a multi-object tracking system that recovers the objects\u2019 trajectories while explicitly reasoning about physical space requirements between each other. The different algorithms are closely coupled by a set of feedback channels, with failure detection mechanisms in each component to ensure robust operation in crowded scenarios. The resulting, integrated mobile vision system is then applied to the task of pedestrian and car tracking in urban environments, where we demonstrate robust and computationally efficient tracking over prolonged time spans. Taking this system as a basic component, we then explore its use for creating dynamic occupancy maps that could serve as input to a path planning module. For pedestrians, we moreover show that the system can be used as a building block for articulated multi-body tracking; and that the motion model for pedestrians can be improved when"

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Starting with a general characterization of the space of sliding-window locations that correspond to geometrically valid object detections, we derive a general algorithm for incorporating ground plane constraints directly into the detector computation. Our approach is indifferent to the choice of detection algorithm and can be applied in a wide range of scenarios. In particular, it allows to effortlessly combine multiple different detectors and to automatically compute regions-of-interest for each of them. We demonstrate its potential in a fast CUDA implementation of the HOG detector and show that our algorithm enables a factor 2-4 speed improvement on top of all other optimizations."

Stereo vision improves such detection by doubling the views of the scene and by giving indirect access to depth information. This depth information can also be used to reduce the set of candidate detection windows. Up to now, most algorithms compute a depth map to discard unpromising detection windows. We propose a novel approach where a stixel world model is computed directly from the stereo images, without computing an intermediate depth map. We experimentally demonstrate that such approach can considerably reduce the set of candidate detection windows at a fraction of the computation cost of previous approaches."

However, the cues available for recognizing a 300 pixel tall object are qualitatively different from those for recognizing a 3 pixel tall object. We argue that for sensors with finite resolution, one should instead use scale-variant, or multiresolution representations that adapt in complexity to the size of a putative detection window. We describe a multiresolution model that acts as a deformable part-based model when scoring large instances and a rigid template with scoring small instances. We also examine the interplay of resolution and context, and demonstrate that context is most helpful for detecting low-resolution instances when local models are limited in discriminative power. We demonstrate impressive results on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark, which contains object instances at a wide range of scales. Whereas recent state-of-the-art methods demonstrate missed detection rates of 86%-37% at 1 false-positive-per-image, our multiresolution model reduces the rate to 29%."

The method is based on the observation that the cost of detection is likely to be dominated by the cost of matching each part to the image, and not by the cost of computing the optimal configuration of the parts as commonly assumed. Therefore accelerating detection requires minimizing the number of part-to-image comparisons. To this end we propose a multiple-resolutions hierarchical part based model and a corresponding coarse-to-fine inference procedure that recursively eliminates from the search space unpromising part placements. The method yields a ten-fold speedup over the standard dynamic programming approach and is complementary to the cascade-of-parts approach of [9]. Compared to the latter, our method does not have parameters to be determined empirically, which simplifies its use during the training of the model. Most importantly, the two techniques can be combined to obtain a very significant speedup, of two orders of magnitude in some cases. We evaluate our method extensively on the PASCAL VOC and INRIA datasets, demonstrating a very high increase in the detection speed with little degradation of the accuracy."

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi2-distance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the resulting systems on the UIUC Cars dataset, the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset and in the PASCAL VOC 2007 competition."

We focus primarily on the case of star-structured models and show how a simple algorithm based on partial hypothesis pruning can speed up object detection by more than one order of magnitude without sacrificing detection accuracy. In our algorithm, partial hypotheses are pruned with a sequence of thresholds. In analogy to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, we introduce the notion of probably approximately admissible (PAA) thresholds. Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples. Finally, we outline a cascade detection algorithm for a general class of models defined by a grammar formalism. This class includes not only tree-structured pictorial structures but also richer models that can represent each part recursively as a mixture of other parts."

Recent progress in real-time dense stereo vision provides precise depth information for nearly every pixel of an image. This rises new questions: How can one efficiently analyze half a million disparity values of next generation imagers? And how can one find all relevant obstacles in this huge amount of data in real-time? In this paper we build a medium-level representation named \"stixel-world\". It takes into account that the free space in front of vehicles is limited by objects with almost vertical surfaces. These surfaces are approximated by adjacent rectangular sticks of a certain width and height. The stixel-world turns out to be a compact but flexible representation of the three-dimensional traffic situation that can be used as the common basis for the scene understanding tasks of driver assistance and autonomous systems."

The general idea behind integral channel features is that multiple registered image channels are computed using linear and \nnon-linear transformations of the input image, and then features such as local sums, histograms, and Haar features and their various generalizations are efficiently computed \nusing integral images. Such features have been used in recent literature for a variety of \ntasks \u2013 indeed, variations appear to have been invented independently multiple times. \nAlthough integral channel features have proven effective, little effort has been devoted to \nanalyzing or optimizing the features themselves. In this work we present a unified view \nof the relevant work in this area and perform a detailed experimental evaluation. We \ndemonstrate that when designed properly, integral channel features not only outperform \nother features including histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), they also (1) naturally \nintegrate heterogeneous sources of information, (2) have few parameters and are insensitive to exact parameter settings, (3) allow for more accurate spatial localization during \ndetection, and (4) result in fast detectors when coupled with cascade classifiers."

Driven by this success, cascade learning has been an area of active research in recent years. Nevertheless, there are still challenging technical problems during the training process of cascade detectors. In particular, determining the optimal target detection rate for each stage of the cascade remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we propose the multiple instance pruning (MIP) algorithm for soft cascades. This algorithm computes a set of thresholds which aggressively terminate computation with no reduction in detection rate or increase in false positive rate on the training dataset. The algorithm is based on two key insights: i) examples that are destined to be rejected by the complete classifier can be safely pruned early; ii) face detection is a multiple instance learning problem. The MIP process is fully automatic and requires no assumptions of probability distributions, statistical independence, or ad hoc intermediate rejection targets. Experimental results on the MIT+CMU dataset demonstrate significant performance advantages."

However, large scale problems require machine learning techniques of at most linear complexity and these are usually limited to linear kernels. This unfortunately rules out gold-standard kernels such as the generalized RBF kernels (e.g. exponential-c 2 ). Recently, Maji and Berg [13] and Vedaldi and Zisserman [20] proposed explicit feature maps to approximate the additive kernels (intersection, c 2 , etc.) by linear ones, thus enabling the use of fast machine learning technique in a non-linear context. An analogous technique was proposed by Rahimi and Recht [14] for the translation invariant RBF kernels. In this paper, we complete the construction and combine the two techniques to obtain explicit feature maps for the generalized RBF kernels. Furthermore, we investigate a learning method using l 1 regularization to encourage sparsity in the final vector representation, and thus reduce its dimension.

Objects are usually detected with less than 100 classifier evaluation, which paves the way for using strong (and thus costly) classifiers: We utilize non-linear SVMs with RBF-c 2 kernels without a cascade-like approximation. Our approach features three key components: a ranking function that operates on sets of hypotheses and a grouping of these into different tasks. Detection efficiency results from adaptively sub-dividing the object search space into decreasingly smaller sets. This is inherited from branch&bound, while the ranking function supersedes a tight bound which is often unavailable (except for too simple function classes). The grouping makes the system effective: it separates image classification from object recognition, yet combines them in a single, structured SVM formulation. A novel aspect of branch&rank is that a better ranking function is expected to decrease the number of classifier calls during detection. We demonstrate the algorithmic properties using the VOC\u201907 dataset."
