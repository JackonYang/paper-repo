Minutiae are essentially terminations and bifurcations of the ridge lines that constitute a fingerprint pattern. Automatic minutiae detection is an extremely critical process, especially in low-quality fingerprints where noise and contrast deficiency can originate pixel configurations similar to minutiae or hide real minutiae. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature; although rather different from each other, all these methods transform fingerprint images into binary images. In this work we propose an original technique, based on ridge line following, where the minutiae are extracted directly from gray scale images. The results achieved are compared with those obtained through some methods based on image binarization. In spite of a greater conceptual complexity, the method proposed performs better both in terms of efficiency and robustness."

                "text": "Distortions in fingerprint images arising from the elasticity of finger skin and the pressure and movement of fingers during image capture lead to great difficulties in establishing a match between multiple images acquired from a single finger. In a single fingerprint image depicting a finger at some given instant of time, it is difficult to get any distortion information. Further, static two-dimensional or three-dimensional (electronic) copies of fingerprints can be fabricated and used to spoof remote biometric security systems since the input required by the systems is not a function of time. This paper addresses these issues, by proposing the novel use of fingerprint video sequences to investigate and exploit dynamic behaviors manifested by fingers over time during image acquisition. In particular, we present a novel approach to detect and estimate distortion occurring in fingerprint video streams. Our approach directly works on MPEG-{1, 2} encoded fingerprint video bitstreams to estimate interfield flow without decompression, and uses flow characteristics to investigate temporal behaviour of the fingerprints. The joint temporal and motion analysis leads to a novel technique to detect and characterize distortion reliably. The proposed method has been tested on the NIST 24 database and the results are very promising."

While tracing the ridges, the fingerprint image is smoothed with an oriented smoothing filter only at selected pixels where smoothing is necessary. After tracing all the ridges, a piece-wise linear skeleton image is obtained. Each ridge in the skeleton is labeled with a number so that each minutiae is associated with one or two ridge numbers. The post-processing is based not only on the location relationship of the minutiae, but also the associated ridge relationship and the certainty level of the minutiae. The performance of this approach is objectively assessed by using two large fingerprint databases."

The local structure of a minutia describes a rotation and translation invariant feature of the minutia in its neighborhood. It is used to find the correspondence of two minutiae sets and increase the reliability of the global matching. The global structure of minutiae reliably determines the uniqueness of fingerprint. Therefore, the local and global structures of minutiae together provide a solid basis for reliable and robust minutiae matching. The proposed minutiae matching scheme is suitable for an online processing due to its high processing speed. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed technique."

But what if the actual performance of these systems falls short of the estimates? The authors designed this article to provide sufficient information to know what questions to ask when evaluating a biometric system, and to assist in determining whether performance levels meet the requirements of an application. For example, a low-performance biometric is probably sufficient for reducing-as opposed to eliminating-fraud. Likewise, completely replacing an existing security system with a biometric-based one may require a high-performance biometric system, or the required performance may be beyond what current technology can provide. Of the biometrics that give the user some control over data acquisition, voice, face, and fingerprint systems have undergone the most study and testing-and therefore occupy the bulk of this discussion. This article also covers the tools and techniques of biometric testing."

This methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (2) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed, and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches."

The features are computed as the local energy of the filter responses. The effect of the filtering is highlighted, keeping the local energy function and the classification algorithm identical for most approaches. For reference, comparisons with two classical nonfiltering approaches, co-occurrence (statistical) and autoregressive (model based) features, are given. We present a ranking of the tested approaches based on extensive experiments."

Two main motivations for research in computer vision are to develop algorithms to solve vision problems and to understand and model the human visual system. It turns out that finding satisfactory answers to either motivation is significantly harder than common wisdom initially assumed. Research in computer vision has actively continued to the current time. Most of the research in the computer vision and pattern recognition community is focused on developing solutions to vision problems. With three decades of research behind current efforts and with the availability of powerful, inexpensive computers, there is a common belief that computer vision is poised to deliver reliable solutions. The area of empirical evaluation of computer vision algorithms is developing the methods and tools for measuring the ability of algorithms to meet requirements to be fielded, for determining the state-of-the-art, and for pointing out future research directions. The goal of this special theme section of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) is to highlight progress in empirical evaluation and identify it as a maturing area of computer vision. Out of 18 submissions, three were accepted for this special section. In addition, one submission was accepted to appear in a regular issue, and two others are being revised for consideration as regular papers. \u201cFiltering for Supervised Texture Segmentation: A Comparative Study\u201d by T. Randen and J.H. Husoy presents a comparative study of methods for texture classification. The emphasis of the study is filtering methods from signal processing. Most major filtering approaches are evaluated. For reference, a statistical algorithm and a model-based algorithm are also evaluated. The paper presents performance results on a number of mosaic texture images. In a first for PAMI, the raw image files for these images are being made available as part of the electronic version of the paper. (The electronic version of the paper is part of the Computer Society\u2019s digital library, accessible online at www.computer.org.) It is hoped that future papers on texture segmentation will take advantage of this in order to present directly comparable experimental results. \u201cPerformance Evaluation and Analysis of Monocular Building Extraction From Aerial Imagery\u201d by J.A. Shufelt evaluates end-to-end performance of four systems on their ability to extract buildings from 83 aerial images of 18 sites. The methodology allows for an examination of traditional assumptions made in designing algorithms that extract buildings from monocular imagery. \u201cEvaluation of Methods for Ridge and Valley Detection\u201d by A.M. Lopez, F. Lumbreras, and J. Serrat evaluates ridge and valley detectors. The authors discuss what are desirable properties of ridge and valley detectors and the methods for measuring desirable properties. Then they present an evaluation using these methods. We hope the papers in this special section are interesting and present challenges for future researchers."

                "text": "Separate compilation is an important tool for coping with design complexity in large software projects. When done right it can also be used to create software libraries, thus promoting code reuse. But separate compilation comes in various flavors and has many facets: namespace management, linking, optimization, dependencies. Many programming languages identify modular units with units of compilation, while only a few extend this to permit hierarchies of language-level modules within individual compilation units. When the number of compilation units is large, then it becomes increasingly important that the mechanism of separate compilation itself can be used to control namespaces. The group model implemented in SML/NJ\u2019s compilation manager CM provides the necessary facilities to avoid unwanted interferences between unrelated parts of large programs. Compilation units are arranged into groups, and explicit export interfaces can be used to control namespaces. When there are many groups, they can be organized into supergroups, and so on, thus forming a hierarchical modular structure. CM provides automatic dependency analysis, but automatic dependency analysis is NP-hard for general SML code. We show two simple restrictions that avoid intractability. To remove the penalties for efficiency usually incurred by modularization and separate compilation, I designed an algorithm for automatic inline expansion across compilation unit boundaries that works in the presence of higher-order functions and free variables; it rearranges bindings and scopes as necessary to move non-expansive code from one module to another. I describe\u2014and implement\u2014the algorithm as transformations on \u03bb-calculus. The inliner is efficient, robust, and practical enough for everyday use in the SML/NJ compiler. It preserves separate compilation and has been integrated with CM. I briefly investigate macro systems as an alternative approach\u2014driven by programmer"
