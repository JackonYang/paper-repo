Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms."

During the optimization, the means, variances and mixing proportions in the mixture adapt to model the clusters in the weight values. Simultaneously, the weights adapt to t the current mixture model so weights get pulled towards the centers of nearby clusters. Suppose, for eaxample, that there are two Gaussians in the mixture. If one gaussian has mean 1 and low variance and the other gaussian has mean 0 and low variance it is very cheap to encode low-variance weights with values near 1 or 0. Nowlan and Hinton (1992) implicitly assumed that the posterior distribution for each weight has a xed and negligible variance so they focussed on maximizing the probability density of the mean of the weight under the coding-prior mixture distribution."

This is especially true when only a small number of di erent weight values are required. However, this more elaborate scheme still su ers from a serious weakness: It assumes that all the weights are quantized to the same tolerance, and that this tolerance is small compared with the standard deviations of the Gaussians used for modelling the weight distribution. Thus it takes into account the probability density of a weight (the height in gure 1) but it ignores the precision (the width). This is a terrible waste of bits. A network is clearly much more economical to describe if some of the weight values can be described very imprecisely without signi cantly a ecting the predictions of the network. MacKay (1992) has considered the e ects of small changes in the weights on the outputs of the network after the network has been trained."
