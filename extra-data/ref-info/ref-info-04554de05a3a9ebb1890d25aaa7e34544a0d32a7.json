A shortcoming of the method is that it assumes that little is known about the prior probabilities of the validities of the correspondences. This paper explains the consequences of that omission and describes how the algorithm's theoretical standing and practical performance can be enhanced by deriving estimates of these prior probabilities. Using the priors in guided-MLESAC is found to give an order of magnitude speed increase for problems where the correspondences are described by one image transformation and clutter. This paper describes two further modifications to guided-MLESAC. The first shows how all putative matches, rather than just the best, from a particular feature can be taken forward into the sampling stage, albeit at the expense of additional computation. The second suggests how to propagate the output from one frame forward to successive frames. The additional information makes guided-MLESAC computationally realistic at video-rates for correspondence sets modeled by two transformations and clutter."

While such priors are commonly combined with the actual measurements via Bayes' rule to calculate posterior probability distributions on model parameters, their additional value in guiding efficient image processing has almost always been overlooked. Priors tell us where to look for information in an image, how much computational effort we can expect to expend to extract it, and of how much utility to the task in hand it is likely to be. Such considerations are of importance in all practical real time vision systems, where the processing resources available at each frame in a sequence are strictly limited - and it is exactly in high frame rate real time systems such as trackers where strong priors are most likely to be available. In this paper, we use Shannon information theory to analyse the fundamental value of measurements using mutual information scores in absolute units of bits, specifically looking at the overwhelming case where uncertainty can be characterised by Gaussian probability distributions. We then compare these measurement values with the computational cost of the image processing required to obtain them. This theory puts on a firm footing for the first time principles of 'active search' for efficient guided image processing, in which candidate features of possibly different types can be compared and selected automatically for measurement."

However, their use emphasises serial attention focussing on a succession of scene features, raising the question of how this should be best achieved to provide localisation information. This paper describes a fully automatic system, able to detect, store and track suitable landmark features during goal-directed navigation. The robot chooses which of the available set of landmarks to track at a certain time to best improve its position knowledge, and decides when it is time to search for new features. Localisation performance improves on that achieved using odometry alone and shows significant advantages over passive structure-from-motion techniques. Rigorous consideration is given to the propagation of uncertainty in the estimation of the positions of the robot and scene features as the robot moves, fixates and shifts fixation. The paper shows how the estimates of these quantities are inherently coupled in any map-building system, and how features can reliably be re-found after periods of neglect, mitigating the \u201cmotion drift\u201d problem often encountered in structure-from-motion algorithms."

Our system, based on the Hierarchical Map approach [1], builds independent local maps in real-time using the EKF-SLAM technique and the inverse depth representation proposed in [2]. The main novelty in the local mapping process is the use of a data association technique that greatly improves its robustness in dynamic and complex environments. A new visual map matching algorithm stitches these maps together and is able to detect large loops automatically, taking into account the unobservability of scale intrinsic to pure monocular SLAM. The loop closing constraint is applied at the upper level of the Hierarchical Map in near real-time. We present experimental results demonstrating monocular SLAM as a human carries a camera over long walked trajectories in outdoor areas with people and other clutter, even in the more difficult case of forward-looking camera, and show the closing of loops of several hundred meters."

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited use; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal, they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hypotheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets, but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. A new, stochastic algorithm is proposed here, the Condensation algorithm \u2014 Conditional Density Propagation over time. It uses \u2018factored sampling\u2019, a method previously applied to interpretation of static images, in which the distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set of representatives. The Condensation algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion in clutter, markedly superior to what has previously been attainable from Kalman filtering. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time."

Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the \"pure vision\" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to structure from motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera"

By learning a generative model of appearance, we can compute not only the similarity of two observations, but also the probability that they originate from the same location, and hence compute a pdf over observer location. We do not limit ourselves to the kidnapped robot problem (localizing in a known map), but admit the possibility that observations may come from previously unvisited places. The principled probabilistic approach we develop allows us to explicitly account for the perceptual aliasing in the environment - identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. Our algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics."

By extending recent advances in keypoint recognition the system can quickly resume tracking - i.e. within a single frame time of 33 ms - using any of the features previously stored in the map.

This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions."

Although work has recently been done\nin distributed and decentralized data fusion, very little of it has addressed sensor management.\nIn decentralized systems, a consistent and coherent approach is essential and the ad\nhoc methods used in other systems become unsatisfactory.\nThis thesis concerns the development of a unified approach to data fusion and sensor\nmanagement in multi-sensor systems in general and decentralized systems in particular,\nwithin a single consistent information-theoretic framework. Our approach is based on considering\ninformation and its gain as the main goal of multi-sensor systems. We develop a\nprobabilistic information update paradigm from which we derive directly architectures and\nalgorithms for decentralized data fusion and, most importantly, address sensor management.\nPresented with several alternatives, the question of how to make decisions leading to\nthe best sensing configuration or actions, defines the management problem. We discuss the\nissues in decentralized decision making and present a normative method for decentralized\nsensor management based on information as expected utility. We discuss several ways of\nrealizing the solution culminating in an iterative method akin to bargaining for a general decentralized\nsystem. Underlying this is the need for a good sensor model detailing a sensor's\nphysical operation and the phenomenological nature of measurements vis-a-vis the probabilistic\ninformation the sensor provides. Also, implicit in a sensor management problem is\nthe existence of several sensing alternatives such as those provided by agile or multi-mode\nsensors. With our application in mind, we detail such a sensor model for a novel Tracking\nSonar with precisely these capabilities making it ideal for managed data fusion. As an\napplication, we consider vehicle navigation, specifically localization and map-building. Implementation\nis on the OxNav vehicle (JTR) which we are currently developing. The results\nshow, firstly, how with managed data fusion, localization is greatly speeded up compared\nto previous published work and secondly, how synergistic operation such as sensor-feature\nassignments, hand-off and cueing can be realised decentrally. This implementation provides\nnew ways of addressing vehicle navigation, while the theoretical results are applicable to a\nvariety of multi-sensing problems."
