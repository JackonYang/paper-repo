Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset of Cai and Yates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline."

This paper introduces the idea of automated reasoning applied to question answering and shows the feasibility of integrating a logic prover into a Question Answering system. The approach is to transform questions and answer passages into logic representations. World knowledge axioms as well as linguistic axioms are supplied to the prover which renders a deep understanding of the relationship between question text and answer text. Moreover, the trace of the proofs provide answer justifications. The results show that the prover boosts the performance of the QA system on TREC questions by 30%."

Providing this supervision is a major bottleneck in scaling semantic parsers. This paper presents a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision burden. We develop two novel learning algorithms capable of predicting complex structures which only rely on a binary feedback signal based on the context of an external world. In addition we reformulate the semantic parsing problem to reduce the dependency of the model on syntactic patterns, thus allowing our parser to scale better using less supervision. Our results surprisingly show that without using any annotated meaning representations learning with a weak feedback signal is capable of producing a parser that is competitive with fully supervised parsers."

Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision."

A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning representations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order."

Systems that can understand and reason over biological processes would dramatically improve the performance of semantic applications involving inference such as question answering (QA) \u2010 specifically \u201cHow?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d questions. In this paper, we present the task of process extraction, in which events within a process and the relations between the events are automatically extracted from text. We represent processes by graphs whose edges describe a set of temporal, causal and co-reference event-event relations, and characterize the structural properties of these graphs (e.g., the graphs are connected). Then, we present a method for extracting relations between the events, which exploits these structural properties by performing joint inference over the set of extracted relations. On a novel dataset containing 148 descriptions of biological processes (released with this paper), we show significant improvement comparing to baselines that disregard process structure."

                "text": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone\u2019s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today\u2019s computers and algorithms."

This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30% of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work."

The resulting resource can be thought of as shallow, in that it does not represent coreference, quantification, and many other higher-order phenomena, but also broad, in that it covers every instance of every verb in the corpus and allows representative statistics to be calculated. We discuss the criteria used to define the sets of semantic roles used in the annotation process and to analyze the frequency of syntactic/semantic alternations in the corpus. We describe an automatic system for semantic role tagging trained on the corpus and discuss the effect on its performance of various types of information, including a comparison of full syntactic parsing with a flat representation and the contribution of the empty trace categories of the treebank."

The framework combines a machine-learning technique with an integer linear programming-based inference procedure, which incorporates linguistic and structural constraints into a global decision process. Within this framework, we study the role of syntactic parsing information in semantic role labeling. We show that full syntactic parsing information is, by far, most relevant in identifying the argument, especially, in the very first stagethe pruning stage. Surprisingly, the quality of the pruning stage cannot be solely determined based on its recall and precision. Instead, it depends on the characteristics of the output candidates that determine the difficulty of the downstream problems. Motivated by this observation, we propose an effective and simple approach of combining different semantic role labeling systems through joint inference, which significantly improves its performance. Our system has been evaluated in the CoNLL-2005 shared task on semantic role labeling, and achieves the highest F1 score among 19 participants."

For example, given an image, LSP can map the statement \u201cblue mug on the table\u201d to the set of image segments showing blue mugs on tables. LSP learns physical representations for both categorical (\u201cblue,\u201d \u201cmug\u201d) and relational (\u201con\u201d) language, and also learns to compose these representations to produce the referents of entire statements. We further introduce a weakly supervised training procedure that estimates LSP\u2019s parameters using annotated referents for entire statements, without annotated referents for individual words or the parse structure of the statement. We perform experiments on two applications: scene understanding and geographical question answering. We find that LSP outperforms existing, less expressive models that cannot represent relational language. We further find that weakly supervised training is competitive with fully supervised training while requiring significantly less annotation effort."

To accomplish that, we present a novel representation of the temporal structure of a news article based on time intervals. We then present an algorithmic approach that jointly optimizes the temporal structure by coupling local classifiers that predict associations and temporal relations between pairs of temporal entities with global constraints. Moreover, we present ways to leverage knowledge provided by event coreference to further improve the system performance. Overall, our experiments show that the joint inference model significantly outperformed the local classifiers by 9.2% of relative improvement in F1. The experiments also suggest that good event coreference could make remarkable contribution to a robust event timeline construction system."

                "text": "The objective of the ACE program is to develop technology to automatically infer from human language data the entities being mentioned, the relations among these entities that are directly expressed, and the events in which these entities participate. Data sources include audio and image data in addition to pure text, and Arabic and Chinese in addition to English. The effort involves defining the research tasks in detail, collecting and annotating data needed for training, development, and evaluation, and supporting the research with evaluation tools and research workshops. This program began with a pilot study in 1999. The next evaluation is scheduled for September 2004. Introduction and Background Today\u2019s global web of electronic information, including most notably the www, provides a resource of unbounded information-bearing potential. But to fully exploit this potential requires the ability to extract content from human language automatically. That is the objective of the ACE program \u2013 to develop the capability to extract meaning from multimedia sources. These sources include text, audio and image data. The ACE program is a \u201ctechnocentric\u201d research effort, meaning that the emphasis is on developing core enabling technologies rather than solving the application needs that motivate the research. The program began in 1999 with a study intended to identify those key content extraction tasks to serve as the research targets for the remainder of the program. These tasks were identified in general as the extraction of the entities, relations and events being discussed in the language. In general objective, the ACE program is motivated by and addresses the same issues as the MUC program that preceded it (NIST 1999). The ACE program, however, attempts to take the task \u201coff the page\u201d in the sense that the research objectives are defined in terms of the target objects (i.e., the entities, the relations, and the events) rather than in terms of the words in the text. For example, the so-called \u201cnamed entity\u201d task, as defined in MUC, is to identify those words (on the page) that are names of entities. In ACE, on the other hand, the corresponding task is to identify the entity so named. This is a different task, one that is more abstract and that involves inference more explicitly in producing an answer. In a real sense, the task is to detect things that \u201caren\u2019t there\u201d. Reference resolution thus becomes an integral and critical part of solving the problem. During the period 2000-2001, the ACE effort was devoted solely to entity detection and tracking. During the period 2002-2003, relations were explored and added. 1 While the ACE program is directed toward extraction of information from audio and image sources in addition to pure text, the research effort is restricted to information extraction from text. The actual transduction of audio and image data into text is not part of the ACE research effort, although the processing of ASR and OCR output from such transducers is. Now, starting in 2004, events are being explored and added as the third of the three original tasks."

Unlike previous pipelined approaches, our model does not assume independence between each fluent or even between named entities with known connections (parent, spouse, employer, etc.). Instead, we model what makes timelines of fluents consistent by learning cross-fluent constraints, potentially spanning entities as well. For example, our model learns that someone is unlikely to start a job at age two or to marry someone who hasn't been born yet. Our system achieves a 36% error reduction over a pipelined baseline."

In particular, our model is able to learn correlations among neighboring arcs (siblings and grandparents), word valency, and tendencies toward nearly-projective parses. The model parameters are learned in a max-margin framework by employing a linear programming relaxation. We evaluate the performance of our parser on data in several natural languages, achieving improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods."

The information is used to construct a biomedical proposition bank called BioProp. Like PropBank in the newswire domain, BioProp contains annotations of predicate argument structures and semantic roles in a treebank schema. To construct BioProp, a semantic role labeling (SRL) system trained on PropBank is used to annotate BioProp. Incorrect tagging results are then corrected by human annotators. To suit the needs in the biomedical domain, we modify the PropBank annotation guidelines and characterize semantic roles as components of biological events. The method can substantially reduce annotation efforts, and we introduce a measure of an upper bound for the saving of annotation efforts. Thus far, the method has been applied experimentally to a 4,389-sentence tree-bank corpus for the construction of BioProp. Inter-annotator agreement measured by kappa statistic reaches .95 for combined decision of role identification and classification when all argument labels are considered. In addition, we show that, when trained on BioProp, our biomedical SRL system called BIOSMILE achieves an F-score of 87%."

These types of relations have mostly been identified in isolation by event pairwise comparison. However, this approach neglects logical constraints between temporal relations of different types that we believe to be helpful. We therefore propose a Markov Logic model that jointly identifies relations of all three relation types simultaneously. By evaluating our model on the TempEval data we show that this approach leads to about 2% higher accuracy for all three types of relations ---and to the best results for the task when compared to those of other machine learning based systems."

Levin starts with the hypothesis that a verb's meaning influences its syntactic behavior and develops it into a powerful tool for studying the English verb lexicon. She shows how identifying verbs with similar syntactic behavior provides an effective means of distinguishing semantically coherent verb classes, and isolates these classes by examining verb behavior with respect to a wide range of syntactic alternations that reflect verb meaning. The first part of the book sets out alternate ways in which verbs can express their arguments. The second presents classes of verbs that share a kernel of meaning and explores in detail the behavior of each class, drawing on the alternations in the first part. Levin's discussion of each class and alternation includes lists of relevant verbs, illustrative examples, comments on noteworthy properties, and bibliographic references. The result is an original, systematic picture of the organization of the verb inventory. Easy to use, \"English Verb Classes and Alternations\" sets the stage for further explorations of the interface between lexical semantics and syntax. It will prove indispensable for theoretical and computational linguists, psycholinguists, cognitive scientists, lexicographers, and teachers of English as a second language. Beth Levin is associate professor of linguistics at Northwestern University."

However, temporal ordering is the type of domain in which global constraints should be relatively easy to represent and reason over. This paper presents a framework that informs local decisions with two types of implicit global constraints: transitivity (A before B and B before C implies A before C) and time expression normalization (e.g. last month is before yesterday). We show how these constraints can be used to create a more densely-connected network of events, and how global consistency can be enforced by incorporating these constraints into an integer linear programming framework. We present results on two event ordering tasks, showing a 3.6% absolute increase in the accuracy of before/after classification over a pairwise model."

The best-performing systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-the-art. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011 Infectious Diseases task."

The two most recent fascicules that have come to hand form Nos. 18 and 19 in that series; No. 18, by M. M. G\u0153tghebuer, is concerned with midges forming the tribe Chironomariae of the family Chironomid\u00e6; and No. 19, by M. L. Borland, deals with the true wasps, together with certain related groups commonly united to form the family Bethylid\u00e6. The method of arrangement adopted in these two parts is similar to their predecessors; namely, a short introduction on structure and biology followed by generic keys: under each genus is a key to the species, while each species is separately described, its general distribution indicated, and any important facts known relative to its biology are recorded. The numerous illustrations and full bibliographic references are also noteworthy. We commend these two monographs to the notice of English entomologists, since the French fauna in cludes most of the British species in the groups concerned.Faune de France. 18: Dipt\u00e8res (N\u00e9matoc\u00e8res); Chironomid\u0153.
