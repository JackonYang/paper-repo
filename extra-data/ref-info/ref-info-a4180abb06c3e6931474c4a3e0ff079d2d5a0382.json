Both D n = maximum {S n (x) \u2013 F{x)} and D n * = maximum | S n (x) \u2013 F(x) | are random variables, independent of the special form of F(x), if F(x) is continuous. This paper contains more extensive tables of the percentage points in the distributions of D n and D n * than have been published previously. These values are obtained by empirical modification of a known asymptotic formula. * This study was supported in part by funds granted to Ohio State University by the Research Foundation for aid in fundamental research.

Classical paradigms such as inversion, rejection, guide tables, and transformations are reviewed.

The authors\u2019 research was sponsored by NSERC Grant A3456 and FCAR Grant 90-ER-0291. 1. The main paradigms The purpose of this chapter is to review the main methods for generating random variables, vectors and processes. Classical workhorses such as the inversion method, the rejection method and table methods are reviewed in section 1. In section 2, we discuss the expected time complexity of various algorithms, and give a few examples of the design of generators that are uniformly fast over entire families of distributions. In section 3, we develop a few universal generators, such as generators for all log concave distributions on the real line. Section 4 deals with random variate generation when distributions are indirectly specified, e.g, via Fourier coefficients, characteristic functions, the moments, the moment generating function, distributional identities, infinite series or Kolmogorov measures. Random processes are briefly touched upon in section 5. Finally, the latest developments in Markov chain methods are discussed in section 6. Some of this work grew from Devroye (1986a), and we are carefully documenting work that was done since 1986. More recent references can be found in the book by H\u00f6rmann, Leydold and Derflinger (2004). Non-uniform random variate generation is concerned with the generation of random variables with certain distributions. Such random variables are often discrete, taking values in a countable set, or absolutely continuous, and thus described by a density. The methods used for generating them depend upon the computational model one is working with, and upon the demands on the part of the output. For example, in a ram (random access memory) model, one accepts that real numbers can be stored and operated upon (compared, added, multiplied, and so forth) in one time unit. Furthermore, this model assumes that a source capable of producing an i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) sequence of uniform [0, 1] random variables is available. This model is of course unrealistic, but designing random variate generators based on it has several advantages: first of all, it allows one to disconnect the theory of non-uniform random variate generation from that of uniform random variate generation, and secondly, it permits one to plan for the future, as more powerful computers will be developed that permit ever better approximations of the model. Algorithms designed under finite approximation limitations will have to be redesigned when the next generation of computers arrives. For the generation of discrete or integer-valued random variables, which includes the vast area of the generation of random combinatorial structures, one can adhere to a clean model, the pure bit model, in which each bit operation takes one time unit, and storage can be reported in terms of bits. Typically, one now assumes that an i.i.d. sequence of independent perfect bits is available. In this model, an elegant information-theoretic theory can be derived. For example, Knuth and Yao (1976) showed that to generate a random integer X described by the probability distribution {X = n} = pn, n \u2265 1, any method must use an expected number of bits greater than the binary entropy of the distribution, \u2211"

It estimates Q ( t ), the expected number of customers in queue at time t , by numerically solving the sets of simultaneous, first-order differential equations that describe these systems. Empirical results have been drawn from these observations. For small values of t , the behavior of Q ( t ) is strongly influenced by the initial state of the queueing system. For systems with deterministic initial conditions, one can roughly predict which of a small set of patterns this behavior will follow. After an initial period of time and independently of initial conditions, Q ( t ) approaches Q (\u221e) in a manner that can be approximated through a decaying exponential function. On the basis of experimental evidence, we have developed an expression that provides a good approximation to the observed values of the time constant associated with this exponential function. This expression can also be used to determine an upper bound for the amount of time required until Q ( t ) is close to Q (\u221e)."

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = \\(\\theta \\left( {\\hat F} \\right) - \\theta \\left( F \\right)\\), \u03b8 some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the \u201cbootstrap\u201d, is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc."

Brief illustrative tables of the first two moments of the order statistics from a geometric distribution are included and two related dice games are discussed. The distribution of the range of a set of independent observations from a geometric distribution is presented in closed form. A system of redundant components which performs a given task repetitively at discrete times and its statistical equivalent, an inverse sampling scheme, are studied. The distribution of the number of stages until the scheme terminates or the system fails is shown to be identical to the distribution of a specific order statistic from a geometric distribution. A Markov chain formulation is presented which facilitates certain system reliability and cost analyses."

It is assumed that the arc passage times are independent and have a finite range. A method is presented for the efficient computation of the density function of the passage time from source to sink of this network, under the restriction that the arc density functions are polynomials. In particular, an algorithm is described that reduces a series-parallel network to a single arc whose density function is that of the time through the original network. The specialization of this algorithm to the class of polynomial density functions leads to a detailed examination of the convolution operation for polynomials. Finally, a method is presented whereby any directed, acyclic network can be transformed to series-parallel form, permitting application of a modified version of the series-parallel algorithm. These techniques are used to find the probability that an arc is on the critical path and a numerical example is presented."

These generalized partial autocorrelations, which are not true correlations except when p = 0, are useful in examining the relationship between the S array method of Gray, Kelley, and McIntire (1978) and the Box-Jenkins approach to ARMA model identification. Also, the generalized partial autocorrelation is shown to be a useful model identification tool to be used along with the S array. Also discussed is a reformating of the S array into a shifted S array that the authors believe is easier to use in practice than the S array. The methods of this paper are illustrated by means of examples, including an analysis of the Makridakis (1978) metals series data."

Bearing manufacturers are therefore constantly engaged in fatigue-testing operations in order to obtain information relating fatigue life to load and other factors. Several of the larger manufacturers have recently pooled their test data in a cooperative effort to set up uniform and standardized ball-bearing application formulas, which would benefit the many users of antifriction bearings. These data were compiled by the American Standards Association, which subsequently requested that the National Bureau of Standards perform the necessary analyses.
