In this paper we approach the problem from an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP). For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level search control. The details of each of the subparts and their interaction during the decoding process are discussed."

A versatile spectral analysis system, the parametrically controlled analyzer (PCA), serves as input to an hierarchically operated string transcriber (HOST). In the design of this system, controllability and modularity for developmental extensibility were primary concerns. The system, with the exception of initial high-fidelity, direct A/D conversion, is entirely implemented in software, PL/I, with appropriate JCL structures for running under OS/MVT on an IBM 360-91. As an adjunct for obtaining training data, a grayscale interactive system using an IBM 1800 process-control computer has also been implemented. PCA signal processing features parametric selection of several analysis methods, including discrete Fourier transform (DFT), linear predictive coding (LPC), and chirp z-transform (CZT). Also, selection may be made among various smoothing, normalization, interpolation, and F 0 estimation methods. PCA develops high-quality spectrographic representations of speech for standard line printers, CRT display, and subsequent processing. PCA also performs spectral-similarity matching and training. HOST consists of a number of processes for performing segmentation, classification, and prosody analysis. Provision is made for complete commutability at the module level as well as at the algorithm level. The segmentation/classification output of HOST is augmented by estimates of confidence. PCA is a packaged, debugged, running system. A first version of HOST is operational."

The configuration of the average vowels in the factor space appeared to be highly correlated with their configuration in the F1\u2212F2 formant plane. After matching to maximal congruence, correlation coefficients along corresponding axes were 0.997 and 0.979. Machine vowel identification, based upon the position of the individual vowels in the four\u2010dimensional factor space, resulted (after three pairs of related vowels were grouped together) in 98% correct identifications if correction was applied for personal timbre of the speakers' voices.

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
