This paper introduces a new perspective toward relaxation-that of considering it as a process for reordering labels attached to nodes in a graph. This new perspective is used to establish the formal equivalence between relaxation and another widely used algorithm, local maxima selection. The equivalence specifies conditions under which a family of cooperative relaxation algorithms, which generalize the well-known ones, decompose into purely local ones. Since these conditions are also sufficient for guaranteeing the convergence of relaxation processes, they serve as stopping criteria. We feel that equivalences such as these are necessary for the proper application of relaxation and maxima selection in complex speech and vision understanding systems."

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

We use a stereographic space rather than the more commonly used gradient space in order to express occluding boundary information. Further, we use \"average\" smoothness constraints rather than the more obvious \"closed loop\" smoothness constraints. We develop alternate constraints from the definition of surface smoothness. since the closed loop constraints do not work in the stereographic space. We solve the image irradiance equation iteratively using a Gauss-Seidel method applied to the the constraints and boundary information. Numerical experiments show that the method is effective. Finally, we analyze SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) pictures using this method. Other applications are also proposed."
