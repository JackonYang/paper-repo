The interface performs elementary image processing functions, such as noise filtering and thresholding of the video image from the scanner. The processor receives a binary image of the document, formats the image into individual character patterns, and classifies the patterns one-by-one. A CPU implementation is highly flexible and avoids much of the development and manufacturing costs for special-purpose, parallel circuitry typically used in commercial OCR. A processor-based recognition system has been investigated for reading documents printed in fixed-pitch conventional type fonts, such as occur in routine office typing. Novel, efficient methods for tracking a print line, resolving it into individual character patterns, detecting underscores, and eliminating noise have been devised. A previously developed classification technique, based on decision trees, has been extended in order to improve reading accuracy in an environment of considerable character variation, including the possibility that documents in the same font style may be produced using quite different print technologies. The system has been tested on typical office documents, and also on artificial stress documents, obtained from a variety of typewriters."

This paper describes the design of a multifont character recognizer which uses a binary decision tree to classify a character on the basis of 197 geometric features. The algorithm for designing the decision tree is based upon an entropy minimization procedure, and makes no assumptions on the distribution or independence of the binary features. The decision tree classifier provides confidence measures which may be used to reduce the substitution error rate at the expense of higher rejection rates. Methods of reducing the overall error rate by combining the decision tree classifier with other classifiers were examined. In particular, the paper evaluates the performance of a classifier using a combination of multiple decision trees, template matching and contextual post-processing. Error rates were highly sensitive to typeface and varied between 10 percent and 0.1 percent. Computer processing times for the various stages of the system are presented."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

The function, called Intelligent Forms Processing (IFP), accepts conventional forms that call for information to be printed in designated blank areas, but in which the information may exceed boundaries due to poor registration during printing. The human eye easily accommodates data that impinge on form boundaries or on background text; however, the same powers of discrimination applied to machine processing pose a technical challenge. The IFP system uses a setup phase to create a model of each form that is to be read. Scanned forms containing data are compared against the matching form model. Special algorithms are employed to extract data fields while removing background printing (e.g., form lines) intersecting the data. The extracted data images are interpreted by an OCR process that reads typical monospace fonts. New fonts may be added easily in a separate design mode. If the data are alphabetic, a lexicon may be assembled to define the possible entries."

Although carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching, and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from what was achievable through shape analysis alone. Several computer vision systems integration issues suggested by this experience are discussed. >"

Previous techniques that utilized context involved letter transition probabilities of digrams and trigrams. This research introduces the concept of binary digrams which overcomes some of the problems of past approaches. They can be used to extract offectively the \"syntax\" of the dictionary while requiring very modest amounts of storage. A computationally feasible procedure is described which allows the accuracy requirements of the character recognizer to be relaxed if it is followed by a contextual postprocessor. The modified recognition system is allowed to output several alternatives for each character, while the postprocessor selects the proper string of characters by having access to both the dictionary and the dictionary syntax. A theoretical estimate of the recognition rate is derived, and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the system to achieve low error and rejection rates."

Recognition of handwritten arabic numerals requires sufficient system flexibility to cope with both unlimited variations in character shape and a large number of writing instruments. This flexibility has been achieved by combining the use of a stored recognition table and a hardware microprogram. The recognition logic obtained by computer simulation is immediately stored in the core memory as a table. The numerals are recognized by extracting a sequence of the geometrical features in horizontal zones of the character after normalization of the height of the character and the width of the strokes. The use of sequential recognition logic helps reduce the capacity of core memory required to obtain the desired high rate of recognition. The correct recognition rate of a single digit for a large sample of letters averaged 95 percent. For a three-digit sorting with 13 stackers the sorter incorrectly recognized approximately 0.1 percent, a rate of error consistent with manual sorting."

                "text": "eyes are everywhere, scrutinizing documents, blood slides, even pizza crusts. With this potpourri of applications, scanners may become as commonplace as today's photographic camera. Optical scanners, or scanning digitizers, are used to convert a picture into an array of numbers representing the positional distribution of optical density within the picture. The relation between the computer-readable output of the optical scanner and the original image is critical to automatic pattern recognition and digital image processing. Optical scanners can be thought of as eyes for computers. They are used in optical character recognition; computer-aided design and drafting; biomedical applications ; geographic data processing, including remote sensing ; facsimile communications; printing and publishing; and experimental physical science. (See center insert on applications.) Commercially, the most widespread application of optical scanners is optical character recognition. Virtually all earlier products were based on mechanical scanners, but the current trend is solid-state transducers. At the same time, the implementation of recognition algorithms is shifting from special-purpose, hard-wired logic to microprocessor-based software. Consequently, large, high-speed OCR systems designed to displace several hundred data entry specialists are gradually giving way to devices that can be cost-justified even in organizations employing only a few data entry personnel. OCR input devices may eventually be attached to even the smallest computer systems, complementing the standard keyboard for alphanumeric entry. To recognize a single character, we need only examine a 30 x 30 picture element array; the exact spatial relation between successive characters is unimportant. Optical scanners designed for character recognition are, therefore , generally not suitable for image input. Image scanners are, however, finding their way into OCR systems designed for less restrictive applications, such as the processing of documents containing gray-scale illustrations, line drawings, and a mix of type fonts. I Engineering applications require the digitization of line drawings with predominantly straight-line segments, such as detail, assembly, structural, and architectural drawings; logic, circuit, and wiring diagrams; printed circuit , wafer, and chip layouts; and utility maps (in-plant and crosscountry cabling, piping and pipelines, conduits , ducts, transmission lines). Ink on mylar has sufficient contrast to allow use of a scanner with only binary (black and white) amplitude output, but variations in re-flectance make pencil drawings difficult to scan. Many engineering applications require a scanner capable of handling a wide range of drawing sizes and a mix of line and alphabetic information.

As a problem in cryptography, the substitution cipher is of limited interest, but it has an important application in optical character recognition. Recent advances render it quite feasible to scan documents with a fairly complex layout and to classify (cluster) the printed characters into distinct groups according to their shape. However, given the immense variety of type styles and forms in current use, it is not possible to assign alphabetical identities to characters of arbitrary size and typeface. This gap can be bridged by solving the equivalent of a substitution cipher problem, thereby opening up the possibility of automatic translation of a scanned document into a standard character code, such as ASCII. Earlier methods relying on letter n-gram frequencies require a substantial amount of ciphertext for accurate n-gram estimates. A dictionary-based approach solves the problem using relatively small ciphertext samples and a dictionary of fewer than 500 words. Our heuristic backtrack algorithm typically visits only a few hundred among the 26! possible nodes on sample texts ranging from 100 to 600 words."

An automatic equalizer was shown which used this algorithm during a training period of test pulse transmission prior to actual data transmission. The present paper extends the utility of this automatic equalization system by permitting it to change settings during the data transmission period in response to changes in transmission channel characteristics. Three schemes for accomplishing this adaptive equalization without the use of test signals are described and evaluated analytically. The first such scheme uses periodic estimates of channel response based on the received data signal to adjust or update the transversal filter settings. The second system is entirely digital and employs a sequential testing procedure to make adjustments aperiodically as they are required by changing conditions. The third system uses information obtained from a forward-acting error correction system for the purposes of adaptive equalization. Of the three systems described, the second is not only theoretically superior, but is practically the simplest. Experimental results for this second system are described."
