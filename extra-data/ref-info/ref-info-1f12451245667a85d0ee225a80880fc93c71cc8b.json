However, a whole-sentence exponential language model is particularly suitable for MCE training, because it can use a relatively small number of powerful features to capture global sentential phenomena. We review the model, discuss feature induction, find features in both the Broadcast News and Switchboard domains, and build an MCE-trained model for the latter. Our experiments show that even models with relatively few features are prone to overfitting and are sensitive to initial parameter setting, leading us to examine alternative weight optimization criteria and search algorithms. 1.

Unfortunately, evaluation has not been a very powerful tool in machine translation (MT) research because it requires human judgments and is thus expensive and time-consuming and not easily factored into the MT research agenda. However, at the July 2001 TIDES PI meeting in Philadelphia, IBM described an automatic MT evaluation technique that can provide immediate feedback and guidance in MT research. Their idea, which they call an \"evaluation understudy\", compares MT output with expert reference translations in terms of the statistics of short sequences of words (word N-grams). The more of these N-grams that a translation shares with the reference translations, the better the translation is judged to be. The idea is elegant in its simplicity. But far more important, IBM showed a strong correlation between these automatically generated scores and human judgments of translation quality. As a result, DARPA commissioned NIST to develop an MT evaluation facility based on the IBM work. This utility is now available from NIST and serves as the primary evaluation measure for TIDES MT research."

The approach is based on the assumption that the word alignment is monotone with respect to the word order in both languages. To reduce the search e ort for this approach, we introduce two methods: an acceleration technique to e ciently compute the dynamic programming recursion equation and a beam search strategy as used in speech recognition. The experimental tests carried out on the Verbmobil corpus showed that the search space, measured by the number of translation hypotheses, is reduced by a factor of about 230 without a ecting the translation performance."

The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical and an alignment model. We describe two different approaches for statistical translation and present experimental results. The first approach is based on dependencies between single words, the second approach explicitly takes shallow phrase structures into account, using two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words. We present results using the Verbmobil task (German-English, 6000word vocabulary) which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output. 1 S t a t i s t i c a l M a c h i n e T r a n s l a t i o n The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.

However, most parsing algorithms, including the Viterbi algorithm, attempt to optimize the same metric, namely the probability of getting the correct labelled tree. By choosing a parsing algorithm appropriate for the evaluation metric, better performance can be achieved. We present two new algorithms: the \"Labelled Recall Algorithm,\" which maximizes the expected Labelled Recall Rate, and the \"Bracketed Recall Algorithm,\" which maximizes the Bracketed Recall Rate. Experimental results are given, showing that the two new algorithms have improved performance over the Viterbi algorithm on many criteria, especially the ones that they optimize."

In this chapter, we discuss the issue of speech recognizer training from a broad perspective with root in the classical Bayes decision theory. We differentiate the method of classifier design by way of distribution estimation and the method of discriminative training based on the fact that in many realistic applications, such as speech recognition, the real signal distribution form is rarely known precisely. We argue that traditional methods relying on distribution estimation are suboptimal when the assumed distribution form is not the true one, and that \u201coptimality\u201d in distribution estimation does not automatically translate into \u201coptimality\u201d in classifier design. We compare the two different methods in the context of hidden Markov modeling for speech recognition. We show the superiority of the discriminative method over the distribution estimation method by providing the results of several key speech recognition experiments."

We consider maximizing discrimination on a parametric family of exponential models that arises naturally in the maximum entropy framework. We show that this optimization problem is globally convex in R/sup n/, and is moreover piecewise linear on R/sup n/. We propose a solution that involves solving a series of linear programming problems. We provide a characterization of global optimizers.

In developing stochastic methods, it is crucial to be able to quickly assess the relative merits of different approaches or models. In this paper, we present several types of intrinsic (system internal) metrics which we have used for baseline quantitative assessment. This quantitative assessment should then be augmented to a fuller evaluation that examines qualitative aspects. To this end, we describe an experiment that tests correlation between the quantitative metrics and human qualitative judgment. The experiment confirms that intrinsic metrics cannot replace human evaluation, but some correlate significantly with human judgments of quality and understandability and can be used for evaluation during development."
