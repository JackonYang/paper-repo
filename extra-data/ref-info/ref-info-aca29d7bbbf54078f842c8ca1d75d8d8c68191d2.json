This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

A video sequence is represented by a bag of spatiotemporal features called video-words by quantizing the extracted 3D interest points (cuboids) from the videos. Our proposed approach is able to automatically discover the optimal number of video-word clusters by utilizing maximization of mutual information(MMI). Unlike the k-means algorithm, which is typically used to cluster spatiotemporal cuboids into video words based on their appearance similarity, MMI clustering further groups the video-words, which are highly correlated to some group of actions. To capture the structural information of the learnt optimal video-word clusters, we explore the correlation of the compact video-word clusters. We use the modified correlogram, which is not only translation and rotation invariant, but also somewhat scale invariant. We extensively test our proposed approach on two publicly available challenging datasets: the KTH dataset and IXMAS multiview dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try the bag of video-words related approach on the multiview dataset. We have obtained very impressive results on both datasets."

The fusion of multiple features is important for recognizing actions as often a single feature based representation is not enough to capture the imaging variations (view-point, illumination etc.) and attributes of individuals (size, age, gender etc.). Hence, we use two types of features: i) a quantized vocabulary of local spatio-temporal (ST) volumes (or cuboids), and ii) a quantized vocabulary of spin-images, which aims to capture the shape deformation of the actor by considering actions as 3D objects (x, y, t). To optimally combine these features, we treat different features as nodes in a graph, where weighted edges between the nodes represent the strength of the relationship between entities. The graph is then embedded into a k-dimensional space subject to the criteria that similar nodes have Euclidian coordinates which are closer to each other. This is achieved by converting this constraint into a minimization problem whose solution is the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. This procedure is known as Fiedler embedding. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on publicly available data sets. The results demonstrate that fusion of multiple features helps in achieving improved performance, and allows retrieval of meaningful features and videos from the embedding space."

Large numbers of features with associated motion vectors are extracted from action data and are represented by many vocabulary trees. Features from a query sequence are matched to the trees and vote for action categories and their locations. Large number of trees make the process efficient and robust. The system is capable of simultaneous categorization and localization of actions using only a few frames per sequence. The approach obtains excellent performance on standard action recognition sequences. We perform large scale experiments on 17 challenging real action categories from Olympic Games1 . We demonstrate the robustness of our method to appearance variations, camera motion, scale change, asymmetric actions, background clutter and occlusion."

However, features are often \"engineered\" to be both sparse and invariant to transformation and it is assumed that they provide the greatest discriminative information. To tackle activity recognition, we propose learning compound features that are assembled from simple 2D corners in both space and time. Each corner is encoded in relation to its neighbours and from an over complete set (in excess of 1 million possible features), compound features are extracted using data mining. The final classifier, consisting of sets of compound features, can then be applied to recognise and localise an activity in real-time while providing superior performance to other state-of-the-art approaches (including those based upon sparse feature detectors). Furthermore, the approach requires only weak supervision in the form of class labels for each training sequence. No ground truth position or temporal alignment is required during training."

To this aim, we propose a new framework where we model actions using three dimensional occupancy grids, built from multiple viewpoints, in an exemplar-based HMM. The novelty is, that a 3D reconstruction is not required during the recognition phase, instead learned 3D exemplars are used to produce 2D image information that is compared to the observations. Parameters that describe image projections are added as latent variables in the recognition process. In addition, the temporal Markov dependency applied to view parameters allows them to evolve during recognition as with a smoothly moving camera. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with experiments on real datasets and with challenging recognition scenarios."

However, in the vision task of continuous action recognition, the observations of visual features have dimensions as high as hundreds or even thousands. This might pose severe difficulties on parameter estimation and even degrade the performance. To bridge the gap between the high dimensional observations and the random fields, we propose a novel model that replace the observation layer of a traditional random fields model with a latent pose estimator. In training stage, the human pose is not observed in the action data, and the latent pose estimator is learned under the supervision of the labeled action data, instead of image-to-pose data. The advantage of this model is twofold. First, it learns to convert the high dimensional observations into more compact and informative representations. Second, it enables transfer learning to fully utilize the existing knowledge and data on image-to-pose relationship. The parameters of the latent pose estimator and the random fields are jointly optimized through a gradient ascent algorithm. Our approach is tested on HumanEva [1] --- a publicly available dataset. The experiments show that our approach can improve recognition accuracy over standard CRF model and its variations. The performance can be further significantly improved by using additional image-to-pose data for training. Our experiments also show that the model trained on HumanEva can generalize to different environment and human subjects."

In previous work, the visual words are learned by unsupervised clustering algorithms. They capture the most common patterns and are good features for coarse-grain recognition tasks like object classification. But for those tasks which deal with subtle differences such as pose estimation, such representation may lack the needed discriminative power. In this paper, we propose to jointly learn the visual words and the pose regressors in a supervised manner. More specifically, we learn an individual distance metric for each visual word to optimize the pose estimation performance. The learned metrics rescale the visual words to suppress unimportant dimensions such as those corresponding to background. Another contribution is that we design an appearance and position context (APC) local descriptor that achieves both selectivity and invariance while requiring no background subtraction. We test our approach on both a quasi-synthetic dataset and a real dataset (HumanEva) to verify its effectiveness. Our approach also achieves fast computational speed thanks to the integral histograms used in APC descriptor extraction and fast inference of pose regressors."

A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial and spatial-temporal features by extracting static and dynamic interest points. We propose a hierarchical model that can be characterized as a constellation of bags-of-features and that is able to combine both spatial and spatial-temporal features. Given a novel video sequence, the model is able to categorize human actions in a frame-by-frame basis. We test the model on a publicly available human action dataset [2] and show that our new method performs well on the classification task. We also conducted control experiments to show that the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification performance over bag of feature models. An additional experiment shows that using both dynamic and static features provides a richer representation of human actions when compared to the use of a single feature type, as demonstrated by our evaluation in the classification task."

Holistic approaches tend to be more sensitive to noise e.g. geometric variations, while part-based approaches usually ignore structural dependencies between parts. This paper presents a novel generative model, which extends probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), to capture both semantic (content of parts) and structural (connection between parts) information for motion category recognition. The structural information learnt can also be used to infer the location of motion for the purpose of motion detection. We test our algorithm on challenging datasets involving human actions, facial expressions and hand gestures and show its performance is better than existing unsupervised methods in both tasks of motion localisation and recognition."

Detection of actions is to find the re-occurrences (e.g. through pattern matching) of such spatio-temporal patterns. This paper addresses two critical issues in pattern matching-based action detection: (1) efficiency of pattern search in 3D videos and (2) tolerance of intra-pattern variations of actions. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a discriminative pattern matching called naive-Bayes based mutual information maximization (NBMIM) for multi-class action categorization. It improves the state-of-the-art results on standard KTH dataset. Second, a novel search algorithm is proposed to locate the optimal subvolume in the 3D video space for efficient action detection. Our method is purely data-driven and does not rely on object detection, tracking or background subtraction. It can well handle the intra-pattern variations of actions such as scale and speed variations, and is insensitive to dynamic and clutter backgrounds and even partial occlusions. The experiments on versatile datasets including KTH and CMU action datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."

In particular we focus on methods which represent the human motion model as a triangulated graph. Previous approaches learned models based just on positions and velocities of the body parts while ignoring their appearance. Moreover, a heuristic approach was commonly used to obtain translation invariance. In this paper we suggest an improved approach for learning such models and using them for human motion recognition. The suggested approach combines multiple cues, i.e., positions, velocities and appearance into both the learning and detection phases. Furthermore, we introduce global variables in the model, which can represent global properties such as translation, scale or view-point. The model is learned in an unsupervised manner from unlabelled data. We show that the suggested hybrid probabilistic model (which combines global variables, like translation, with local variables, like relative positions and appearances of body parts), leads to: (i) faster convergence of learning phase, (it) robustness to occlusions, and, (Hi) higher recognition rate."

It has been established previously that there exist no invariants for 3D to 2D projection. However, there exist a wealth of techniques in 2D invariance that can be used to advantage in 3D to 2D projection. We exploit these techniques and model actions in terms of view-invariant canonical body poses and trajectories in 2D invariance space, leading to a simple and effective way to represent and recognize human actions from a general viewpoint. We first evaluate the approach theoretically and show why a straightforward application of the 2D invariance idea will not work. We describe strategies designed to overcome inherent problems in the straightforward approach and outline the recognition algorithm. We then present results on 2D projections of publicly available human motion capture data as well on manually segmented real image sequences. In addition to robustness to viewpoint change, the approach is robust enough to handle different people, minor variabilities in a given action, and the speed of aciton (and hence, frame-rate) while encoding sufficient distinction among actions."

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

The use of such features makes the problem more manageable while providing increased robustness to noise and pose variation. In this work we develop an extension of these ideas to the spatio-temporal case. For this purpose, we show that the direct 3D counterparts to commonly used 2D interest point detectors are inadequate, and we propose an alternative. Anchoring off of these interest points, we devise a recognition algorithm based on spatio-temporally windowed data. We present recognition results on a variety of datasets including both human and rodent behavior."

We propose to extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for its interpretation. To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points. For the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how the proposed method allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic backgrounds."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

This is achieved by creating a discriminative dictionary tailored to the task by following the information bottleneck principle. Second, we perform feature-based categorization efficiently on a dense grid by extending the concept of integral images to the computation of local histograms. Third, we compute SIFT descriptors densely in linear time. We compare our method to the state of the art and find that it excels in accuracy and simplicity, performing better while assuming less."

The performance is measured against changes in viewpoint, scale, illumination, defocus and image compression.The objective of this paper is also to establish a reference test set of images and performance software, so that future detectors can be evaluated in the same framework."

The link analysis techniques are based on well-established graph mining techniques used in diverse applications such as WWW, bioinformatics, and social networks. The techniques operate directly on the patterns of connections between features in the graph rather than on statistical properties, e.g., from clustering in feature space. We argue that the resulting techniques are simpler, and we show that they perform similarly or better compared to state of the art techniques on common data sets. We also show results on more challenging data sets than those that have been used in prior work on unsupervised modeling."

We build the adjacency matrix M of a graph whose nodes represent the potential correspondences and the weights on the links represent pairwise agreements between potential correspondences. Correct assignments are likely to establish links among each other and thus form a strongly connected cluster. Incorrect correspondences establish links with the other correspondences only accidentally, so they are unlikely to belong to strongly connected clusters. We recover the correct assignments based on how strongly they belong to the main cluster of M, by using the principal eigenvector of M and imposing the mapping constraints required by the overall correspondence mapping (one-to-one or one-to-many). The experimental evaluation shows that our method is robust to outliers, accurate in terms of matching rate, while being much faster than existing methods"

Feature clustering is a powerful alternative to feature selection for reducing the dimensionality of text data. In this paper we propose a new information-theoretic divisive algorithm for feature/word clustering and apply it to text classification. Existing techniques for such \"distributional clustering\" of words are agglomerative in nature and result in (i) sub-optimal word clusters and (ii) high computational cost. In order to explicitly capture the optimality of word clusters in an information theoretic framework, we first derive a global criterion for feature clustering. We then present a fast, divisive algorithm that monotonically decreases this objective function value. We show that our algorithm minimizes the \"within-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\" while simultaneously maximizing the \"between-cluster Jensen-Shannon divergence\". In comparison to the previously proposed agglomerative strategies our divisive algorithm is much faster and achieves comparable or higher classification accuracies. We further show that feature clustering is an effective technique for building smaller class models in hierarchical classification. We present detailed experimental results using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines on the 20Newsgroups data set and a 3-level hierarchy of HTML documents collected from the Open Directory project (www.dmoz.org)."

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine to define the values and traditional techniques of data in hypertext. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want."
