The augmented system approach is seen to avoid difficulties of numerical instability and inefficiency associated with free variables and with dense columns in the normal equations approach. Solving the indefinite systems does incur an extra overhead, whose median is about 40% in our tests; but the augmented system approach proves to be faster for a minority of cases in which the normal equations have relatively dense Cholesky factors. A detailed analysis shows that the augmented system factorization is reliable over a fairly large range of the parameter settings that control the tradeoff between sparsity and numerical stability."

Report 90-03, Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 1990] recently described a predictor\u2013corrector variant of the primal\u2013dual interior-point algorithm for linear programming. This paper describes a full implementation of this algorithm, with extensions for solving problems with free variables and problems with bounds on primal variables. Computational results on the NETLIB test set are given to show that this new method almost always improves the performance of the primal\u2013dual algorithm and that the improvement increases dramatically as the size and complexity of the problem increases. A numerical instability in using Schur complements to remove dense columns is identified, and a numerical remedy is given."

After a preliminary discussion of the convergence of the (primal) projected Newton barrier method, three types of barrier method are analyzed. These methods may be categorized as primal, dual and primal\u2014dual, and may be derived from the application of Newton's method to different variants of the same system of nonlinear equations. A fourth variant of the same equations leads to a new primal\u2014dual method.In each of the methods discussed, convergence is demonstrated without the need for a nondegeneracy assumption or a transformation that makes the provision of a feasible point trivial. In particular, convergence is established for a primal\u2014dual algorithm that allows a different step in the primal and dual variables and does not require primal and dual feasibility.Finally, a new method for treating free variables is proposed."

The algorithm is based on the path following idea. We show that the duality gap is reduced at each iteration by a factor of (1 $-$ $\\delta$/$\\sqrt{n}$) where 0.1 $\\leq$ $\\delta$ $<$ 1. As a consequence, an optimal solution for our problem can be found in at most O($\\sqrt{n}$L) iterations. \nWe also describe how the primal-dual algorithm can be extended to solve a class of convex separable programming problems subject to linear constraints.

The research community is somewhat troubled by the lack of a standard format for defining a QP problem and also by the lack of a standard reference set of problems for purposes similar to that of LP. In the paper we propose a standard format and announce the availability of a test set of collected 138 QP problems."

Computations in this approach do not require that primal and dual solutions be feasible. Expressions are given to compute all the higher-order derivatives of the trajectory of interest. The implementation ensures that a suitable potential function is reduced by a constant amount at each iteration.There are several salient features of this approach. An adaptive heuristic for estimating the centering parameter is given. The approach used to compute the step length is also adaptive. A new practical approach to compute the starting point is given. This approach treats primal and dual problems symmetrically.Computational results on a subset of problems available from netlib are given. On mutually tested problems the results show..."

The paper is well organized and thoughtful. The results of their experiments clearly indicate that for large problems interior-point methods offer a serious alternative to the simplex method. In these comments, we will try to clarify the relation among some of the algorithms discussed in LMS. In addition, we will compare the implementation strategy described in LMS, which is based on solving the so-called normal equations, to an alternative implementation strategy based on solving the so-called reduced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system. We will show that for many problems the two approaches yield virtually identical results but, for certain classes of challenging problems, the reduced KKT approach yields a much more efficient code. Also, we will a..."

Although such matrices are indefinite, it is shown that any symmetric permutation of a quasidefinite matrix yields a factorization $LDL^T $.This result is applied to obtain a new approach for solving the symmetric indefinite systems arising in interior-point methods for linear and quadratic programming. These systems are typically solved either by reducing to a positive definite system or by performing a Bunch\u2013Parlett factorization of the full indefinite system at every iteration. This is an intermediate approach based on reducing to a quasidefinite system. This approach entails less fill-in than further reducing to a positive definite system, but is based on a static ordering and is therefore more efficient than performing Bunch\u2013Parlett factorizations of the original indefinite system."

Although many of these facilities were originally produced by the authors in conjunction with the software package LANCELOT, we believe that they will be useful in their own right and should be available to researchers for their development of optimization software. The tools can be obtained by anonymous ftp from a number of sources and may, in many cases, be installed automatically. The scope of a major collection of test problems written in the standard input format (SIF) used by the LANCELOT software package is described. Recognizing that most software was not written with the SIF in mind, we provide tools to assist in building an interface between this input format and other optimization packages. These tools provide a link between the SIF and a number of existing packages, including MINOS and OSL. Additionally, as each problem includes a specific classification that is designed to be useful in identifying particular classes of problems, facilities are provided to build and manage a database of this information. There is a Unix and C shell bias to many of the descriptions in the article, since, for the sake of simplicity, we do not illustrate everything in its fullest generality. We trust that the majority of potential users are sufficiently familiar with Unix that these examples will not lead to undue confusion."

This paper describes these various enhancements, their historical development, and some experiments showing how very effective they are in improving the execution time of the algorithm. A shortcoming is also presented that exists in all of the widely used implementations of the algorithm, namely, that the quality of the ordering provided by the implementations is surprisingly sensitive to the initial ordering. For example, changing the input ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as much as a factor of three in the cost of the subsequent numerical factorization. This sensitivity is caused by the lack of an effective tie-breaking strategy, and the authors\u2019 experiments illustrate the importance of developing such a strategy"
