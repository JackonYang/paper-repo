This includes information about the logical document structure of use to downstream components, such as search, navigation, and summarization. In this paper, the authors describe SectLabel, a module that further develops existing software to detect the logical structure of a document from existing PDF files, using the formalism of conditional random fields. While previous work has assumed access only to the raw text representation of the document, a key aspect of this work is to integrate the use of a richer representation of the document that includes features from optical character recognition OCR, such as font size and text position. Experiments reveal that using such rich features improves logical structure detection by a significant 9 F1 points, over a suitable baseline, motivating the use of richer document representations in other digital library applications."

The paper discusses a new system for table structure recognition in untagged PDF documents. It is formulated as a set of configurable parameters and ad-hoc heuristics for recovering table cells. We consider two different configurations for the system and demonstrate experimental results based on the existing competition dataset for both of them."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel end-to-end system for table understanding in document images called DeepDeSRT. In particular, the contribution of DeepDeSRT is two-fold. First, it presents a deep learning-based solution for table detection in document images. Secondly, it proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for table structure recognition, i.e. identifying rows, columns, and cell positions in the detected tables. In contrast to existing rule-based methods, which rely on heuristics or additional PDF metadata (like, for example, print instructions, character bounding boxes, or line segments), the presented system is data-driven and does not need any heuristics or metadata to detect as well as to recognize tabular structures in document images. Furthermore, in contrast to most existing table detection and structure recognition methods, which are applicable only to PDFs, DeepDeSRT processes document images, which makes it equally suitable for born-digital PDFs (as they can automatically be converted into images) as well as even harder problems, e.g. scanned documents. To gauge the performance of DeepDeSRT, the system is evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 table competition dataset containing 67 documents with 238 pages overall. Evaluation results reveal that DeepDeSRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods for table detection and structure recognition and achieves F1-measures of 96.77% and 91.44% for table detection and structure recognition, respectively. Additionally, DeepDeSRT is evaluated on a closed dataset from a real use case of a major European aviation company comprising documents which are highly unlike those in ICDAR 2013. Tested on a randomly selected sample from this dataset, DeepDeSRT achieves high detection accuracy for tables which demonstrates the sound generalization capabilities of our system."

PaperXML has been initially developed for the ACL Anthology Searchbench. The main purpose was to robustly provide uniform access to sentences in ACL Anthology papers from the past 46 years, ranging from scanned, typewriter-written conference and workshop proceedings papers, up to recent high-quality typeset, born-digital journal articles, with varying layouts. PaperXML markup includes information on page and paragraph breaks, section headings, footnotes, tables, captions, boldface and italics character styles as well as bibliographic and publication metadata. The role of paperXML in the ACL Contributed Task Rediscovering 50 Years of Discoveries is to serve as fall-back source (1) for older, scanned papers (mostly published before the year 2000), for which born-digital PDF sources are not available, (2) for born-digital PDF papers on which the PDFExtract method failed, (3) for document parts where PDFExtract does not output useful markup such as currently for tables. We sketch transformation of paperXML into the ACL Contributed Task's TEI P5 XML."

We integrate the paradigm into our latest developed system ({\\it PdfExtra}) to detect the region of tables by means of 9,466 academic articles from the entire repository of {\\it ACL Anthology}, where almost all papers are archived by PDF format without annotation for tables. The paradigm first designs heuristics to automatically construct weakly labeled data. It then feeds diverse evidences, such as layouts of documents and linguistic features, which are extracted by {\\it Apache PDFBox} and processed by {\\it Stanford NLP} toolkit, into different canonical classifiers. We finally use these classifiers, i.e. {\\it Naive Bayes}, {\\it Logistic Regression} and {\\it Support Vector Machine}, to collaboratively vote on the region of tables. Experimental results show that {\\it PdfExtra} achieves a great leap forward, compared with the state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, we discuss the factors of different features, learning models and even domains of documents that may impact the performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our paradigm is compatible enough to leverage various features and learning models for open-domain table region detection within PDF files."

This paper presents a new dataset (and the methodology used to create it) based on a wide range of contemporary documents. Strong emphasis is placed on comprehensive and detailed representation of both complex and simple layouts, and on colour originals. In-depth information is recorded both at the page and region level. Ground truth is efficiently created using a new semi-automated tool and stored in a new comprehensive XML representation, the PAGE format. The dataset can be browsed and searched via a web-based front end to the underlying database and suitable subsets (relevant to specific evaluation goals) can be selected and downloaded."

In this paper, we propose a hybrid method combining deep structured prediction and supervised clustering to detect formulas, tables and figures in PDF document images within a unified framework. The primitive region proposals extracted from each column region are classified and clustered with conditional random field (CRF) based graphical models which can integrate both local and contextual information. Both the unary and pairwise potentials of CRFs are formulated as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to better exploit spatial contextual information. The CRF for clustering predicts the linked/cut label of between-region links. After CRF inference, the line regions of same class within a cluster are grouped into a page object. The state-of-the-art performance obtained on the public available ICDAR2017 POD competition dataset demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the nronosed method."

While everyone seems to know what a table is, a precise, analytical definition of \u201ctabularity\u201d remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Most past research has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from raster images of tables scanned from printed documents, although there is growing interest in the processing of tables in electronic form as well. Recent research on table composition and table analysis has improved our understanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. This review, which is structured in terms of generalized paradigms for table processing, indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display."

First, a large search space of potential programs needs to be explored at training time to find a correct program. Second, spurious programs that accidentally lead to a correct denotation add noise to training. In this work we propose that in closed worlds with clear semantic types, one can substantially alleviate these problems by utilizing an abstract representation, where tokens in both the language utterance and program are lifted to an abstract form. We show that these abstractions can be defined with a handful of lexical rules and that they result in sharing between different examples that alleviates the difficulties in training. To test our approach, we develop the first semantic parser for CNLVR, a challenging visual reasoning dataset, where the search space is large and overcoming spuriousness is critical, because denotations are either TRUE or FALSE, and thus random programs are likely to lead to a correct denotation. Our method substantially improves performance, and reaches 82.5% accuracy, a 14.7% absolute accuracy improvement compared to the best reported accuracy so far."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

Knowledge-based weak supervision, using structured data to heuristically label a training corpus, works towards this goal by enabling the automated learning of a potentially unbounded number of relation extractors. Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). \n \nThis paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

The discussed recognition process differs significantly from existing approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments, whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page from the top-down. The following analysis of the recognized layout elements is based on the construction of a tile structure and detects row- and/or column spanning cells as well as sparse tables with a high degree of confidence. \n \nThe overall system is completely domain independent, optionally neglects textual contents and can thus be applied to arbitrary mixed-mode documents (with or without tables) of any language and even operates on low quality OCR documents (e.g. facsimiles)."

In contrast to most of the existing methods relying on either labelled corpora for classifier training or linguistic pattern extraction for subjectivity classification, we view the problem as weakly-supervised generative model learning, where the only input to the model is a small set of domain independent subjectivity lexical clues. A mechanism is introduced to incorporate the prior information about the subjectivity lexical clues into model learning by modifying the Dirichlet priors of topic-word distributions. The subjLDA model has been evaluated on the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) dataset and promising results have been observed in the preliminary experiments. We have also explored adding neutral words as prior information for model learning. It was found that while incorporating subjectivity clues bearing positive or negative polarity can achieve a significant performance gain, the prior lexical information from neutral words is less effective."

It is a hard problem due to varying layouts and encodings of the tables. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for table detection based on layout analysis of documents. Most of these techniques fail to generalize because they rely on hand engineered features which are not robust to layout variations. In this paper, we have presented a deep learning based method for table detection. In the proposed method, document images are first pre-processed. These images are then fed to a Region Proposal Network followed by a fully connected neural network for table detection. The proposed method works with high precision on document images with varying layouts that include documents, research papers, and magazines. We have done our evaluations on publicly available UNLV dataset where it beats Tesseract's state of the art table detection system by a significant margin."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of tables present in documents, leveraging the potential of deep neural networks. Conventional approaches for table detection rely on heuristics that are error prone and specific to a dataset. In contrast, the presented approach harvests the potential of data to recognize tables of arbitrary layout. Most of the prior approaches for table detection are only applicable to PDFs, whereas, the presented approach directly works on images making it generally applicable to any format. The presented approach is based on a novel combination of deformable CNN with faster R-CNN/FPN. Conventional CNN has a fixed receptive field which is problematic for table detection since tables can be present at arbitrary scales along with arbitrary transformations (orientation). Deformable convolution conditions its receptive field on the input itself allowing it to mold its receptive field according to its input. This adaptation of the receptive field enables the network to cater for tables of arbitrary layout. We evaluated the proposed approach on two major publicly available table detection datasets: ICDAR-2013 and ICDAR-2017 POD. The presented approach was able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance on both ICDAR-2013 and ICDAR-2017 POD datasets with a F-measure of 0.994 and 0.968, respectively, indicating its effectiveness and superiority for the task of table detection."

The application provides search in both its bibliographic metadata and semantically analyzed full textual content. By combining these two features, very efficient and focused queries are possible. At the same time, the application serves as a showcase for the recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) research and language technology. The system currently indexes the textual content of 7,500 anthology papers from 2002--2009 with predicate-argument-like semantic structures. It also provides useful search filters based on bibliographic metadata. It will be extended to provide the full anthology content and enhanced functionality based on further NLP techniques."

Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined.

But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available."

It is a difficult problem due to the variety of table layouts, encoding techniques and the similarity of tabular regions with non-tabular document elements. Earlier approaches of table detection are based on heuristic rules or require additional PDF metadata. Recently proposed methods based on machine learning have shown good results. This paper demonstrates performance improvement to these table detection techniques. The proposed solution is based on the observation that tables tend to contain more numeric data and hence it applies color coding/coloration as a signal for telling apart numeric and textual data. Deep learning based Faster R-CNN is used for detection of tabular regions from document images. To gauge the performance of our proposed solution, publicly available UNLV dataset is used. Performance measures indicate improvement when compared with best in-class strategies."

We then use this weak supervision to \u201csprinkle\u201d artificial words to the training documents to identify topics in accordance with the underlying class structure of the corpus based on the higher order word associations. We evaluate this approach to improve performance of text classification on three real world datasets."

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\u00d7 deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation."

                "text": "Negation scope detection is widely performed as a supervised learning task which relies upon negation labels at word level. This suffers from two key drawbacks: (1) such granular annotations are costly and (2) highly subjective, since, due to the absence of explicit linguistic resolution rules, human annotators often disagree in the perceived negation scopes. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first approach that eliminates the need for world-level negation labels, replacing it instead with document-level sentiment annotations. For this, we present a novel strategy for learning fully interpretable negation rules via weak supervision: we apply reinforcement learning to find a policy that reconstructs negation rules from sentiment predictions at document level. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach for weak supervision can effectively learn negation rules. Furthermore, an out-of-sample evaluation via sentiment analysis reveals consistent improvements (of up to 4.66%) over both a sentiment analysis with (i) no negation handling and (ii) the use of word-level annotations from humans. Moreover, the inferred negation rules are fully interpretable."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.
