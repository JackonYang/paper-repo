The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence of classification performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets."

If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values."

We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \u201cpyramid match\u201d computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels.

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

We use a local linear discriminant analysis to estimate an effective metric for computing neighborhoods. We determine the local decision boundaries from centroid information, and then shrink neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to these local decision boundaries, and elongate them parallel to the boundaries. Thereafter, any neighborhood-based classifier can be employed, using the modified neighborhoods. The posterior probabilities tend to be more homogeneous in the modified neighborhoods.

The approachis similar in spirit to Tangent Distance, but with invariances inferred from the local neighborhood rather than prior knowledge.

While discriminative approaches to learning and classification have, in principle, superior performance, generative approaches provide many useful features, one of which is the ability to naturally establish explicit correspondence between model components and scene features - this, in turn, allows for the handling of missing data and unsupervised learning in clutter. We explore a hybrid generative/discriminative approach using 'Fisher kernels' by Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) which retains most of the desirable properties of generative methods, while increasing the classification performance through a discriminative setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this kernel framework can be used to combine different types of features and models into a single classifier. Our experiments, conducted on a number of popular benchmarks, show strong performance improvements over the corresponding generative approach and are competitive with the best results reported in the literature."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Local learning algorithms attempt to locally adjust the capacity of the training system to the properties of the training set in each area of the input space. The family of local learning algorithms contains known methods, like the k-nearest neighbors method (kNN) or the radial basis function networks (RBF), as well as new algorithms. A single analysis models some aspects of these algorithms. In particular, it suggests that neither kNN or RBF, nor nonlocal classifiers, achieve the best compromise between locality and capacity. A careful control of these parameters in a simple local learning algorithm has provided a performance breakthrough for an optical character recognition problem. Both the error rate and the rejection performance have been significantly improved."

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion."

A statistical approach is developed where textures are modelled by the joint probability distribution of filter responses. This distribution is represented by the frequency histogram of filter response cluster centres (textons). Recognition proceeds from single, uncalibrated images and the novelty here is that rotationally invariant filters are used and the filter response space is low dimensional.Classification performance is compared with the filter banks and methods of Leung and Malik [IJCV, 2001], Schmid [CVPR, 2001] and Cula and Dana [IJCV, 2004] and it is demonstrated that superior performance is achieved here. Classification results are presented for all 61 materials in the Columbia-Utrecht texture database.We also discuss the effects of various parameters on our classification algorithm--such as the choice of filter bank and rotational invariance, the size of the texton dictionary as well as the number of training images used. Finally, we present a method of reliably measuring relative orientation co-occurrence statistics in a rotationally invariant manner, and discuss whether incorporating such information can enhance the classifier\u2019s performance."

Our starting point is a generalized notion of the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy."

As in that work, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results strengthen the case for using this class of model in computer vision."

For an N-class problem, the DDAG contains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, one for each pair of classes. We present a VC analysis of the case when the node classifiers are hyperplanes; the resulting bound on the test error depends on N and on the margin achieved at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. This motivates an algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision-node of the DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evaluate than either the standard algorithm or Max Wins, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms."

                "text": "This contribution proposes a compositional approach to visual object categorization of scenes. Compositions are learned from the Caltech 101 database and form intermediate abstractions of images that are semantically situated between low-level representations and the high-level categorization. Salient regions, which are described by localized feature histograms, are detected as image parts. Subsequently compositions are formed as bags of parts with a locality constraint. After performing a spatial binding of compositions by means of a shape model, coupled probabilistic kernel classifiers are applied thereupon to establish the final image categorization. In contrast to the discriminative training of the categorizer, intermediate compositions are learned in a generative manner yielding relevant part agglomerations, i.e. groupings which are frequently appearing in the dataset while simultaneously supporting the discrimination between sets of categories. Consequently, compositionality simplifies the learning of a complex categorization model for complete scenes by splitting it up into simpler, sharable compositions. The architecture is evaluated on the highly challenging Caltech 101 database which exhibits large intra-category variations. Our compositional approach shows competitive retrieval rates in the range of 53.6 \u00b1 0.88% or, with a multi-scale feature set, rates of 57.8 \u00b1 0.79%."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the 3D texton model can be used to predict the appearance of materials under novel conditions."

In most of these works, local patches are modeled as basic building blocks of an image, analogous to words in text documents. In most previous works using the \"bag of words\" models (e.g. [4, 20, 7]), the local patches are assumed to be independent with each other. In this paper, we relax the independence assumption and model explicitly the inter-dependency of the local regions. Similarly to previous work , we represent images as a collection of patches, each of which belongs to a latent \"theme\" that is shared across images as well as categories. We learn the theme distributions and patch distributions over the themes in a hierarchical structure [22]. In particular, we introduce a linkage structure over the latent themes to encode the dependencies of the patches. This structure enforces the semantic connections among the patches by facilitating better clustering of the themes. As a result, our models for object categories tend to be more discriminative than the ones obtained under the independent patch assumption. We show highly competitive categorization results on both the Caltech 4 and Caltech 101 object category datasets. By examining the distributions of the latent themes for each object category, we construct an object taxonomy using the 101 object classes from the Caltech 101 datasets."

At the heart of this is the notion of an alignment between the shapes to be matched. The transformation necessary for alignment and the remaining differences after alignment are then used to make a comparison. \nA model determines what kind of deformations or alignments are acceptable, and what variation in appearance should remain after alignment. This ties strongly with the idea that the difference in shape is the residual difference, after some family of transformations has been applied for alignment. \nFinding an alignment of a model to a novel object involves search through the space of possible alignments. In many settings this search is quite difficult. This work shows that the search can be approximated by an easier discrete matching problem between key points on a model and a novel object. This is a departure from traditional approaches to deformable template matching that concentrate on analyzing differential models. This thesis presents theories and experiments on searching for, identifying, and using alignments found via discrete matchings. \nIn particular we present a mathematical and ecological motivation for a medium scale descriptor of shape, geometric blur. Geometric blur is an average over transformations of a sparse signal or feature channel, and can be computed using a spatially varying convolution. The resulting shape descriptors are useful for evaluating local shape similarity. Experiments demonstrate their efficacy for image classification and shape correspondence. \nFinding alignments between shapes is formulated as an optimization problem over discrete matchings between feature points in images. Similarity between putative correspondences is measured using geometric blur, and the deformation in the configuration of points is measured by summing over deformations in pairwise relationships. The snatching problem is formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem and approximated with a simple technique. Experimental results indicate that this generic model of local shape and deformation is applicable across a wide variety of object categories, providing good (currently the best known) performance for object recognition and localization on a difficult object recognition benchmark. \nFurthermore this generic object alignment strategy can be used to model variation in images of an object category, identifying the repeated object structures and providing automatic localization of the objects."

We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples.

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

If the amount of data and computational resources are near infinite, many algorithmes will probably converge to the optimal solution. When this is not the case, one has to introduce regularizers and a-priori knowledge to supplement the available data in order to boost the performance. Invariance (or known dependance) with respect to transformation of the input is a frequent occurrence of such an a-priori knowledge. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of tangent vectors, which compactly represent the essence of these transformation invariances, and two classes of algorithms, \u201cTangent distance\u201d and \u2018Tangent propagation\u201d, which make use of these invariances to improve performance."

Consider the problem in which the only knowledge of F is that which can be inferred from samples (x_{1},\\theta_{1}),(x_{2},\\theta_{2}), \\cdots ,(x_{n}, \\theta_{n}) , where the (x_{i}, \\theta_{i})'s are independently identically distributed according to F . Let the nearest neighbor estimate of the parameter \\theta associated with an observation x be defined to be the parameter \\theta_{n}^{'} associated with the nearest neighbor x_{n}^{'} to x . Let R be the large sample risk of the nearest neighbor rule. It will be shown, for a wide range of probability distributions, that R \\leq 2R^{\\ast} for metric loss functions and R = 2R^{\\ast} for squared-error loss functions. A simple estimator using the nearest k neighbors yields R = R^{\\ast} (1 + 1/k) in the squared-error loss case. In this sense, it can be said that at least haft the information in the infinite training set is contained in the nearest neighbor. This paper is an extension of earlier work[q from the problem of classification by the nearest neighbor rule to that of estimation. However, the unbounded loss functions in the estimation problem introduce additional problems concerning the convergence of the unconditional risk. Thus some work is devoted to the investigation of natural conditions on the underlying distribution assuring the desired convergence."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of datasets."

All growths were performed in an MOVPE reactor operating at a pressure of 200 mBar and temperature of 630 degrees C. Typical growth rates ranged from 4-7 AA/sec.
