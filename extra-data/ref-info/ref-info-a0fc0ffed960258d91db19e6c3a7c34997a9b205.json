                "text": "Much of one\u2019s knowledge of a task domain is in the form of simple facts and procedures. While these facts and procedures may vary from domain to domain, there is often substantial &nilarity in the \u201cabstract structure\u201d of the knowledge. For example, the notion of a hierarchy is \u2018found in biological taxonomy, the geological classification of time, and the organization chart of a corporation. One advantage of recognizing such abstractions is that they can be used in selecting metaphors and models that are computationally very powerful and efficient. This power and efficiency can be used in evaluating plausible hypotheses about new domains and can thereby motivate the induction of abstractions even in the face of partial or inconsistent data. Furthermore, there is a seductive argument for how such information processing criteria can be used in characterizing \u201cintuitive\u201d thought and in explaining the cogency of causal arguments. The idea of large-scale, unified knowledge structures like abstractions is not a new one. The gestalt psychologists (e.g. [Kohler]) had the intuition decades ago, and recently Kuhn [Kuhn], Minsky [Minsky], and Schank [Schank & Abelson] have embodied similar intuitions in their notions of paradigms, frames, and scripts. (See also [Bobrow & Norman] and [Moore & Newell] for related ideas.) The novelty hcrc lies in the use of such structures to select g6od metaphoa and models and in the effects of the resulting power and efficiency on cognitive behavior."

                "text": "Harpy is a speech understanding system that attained (in 1976) a set of highly demanding specifications laid down in 1971 for the recognition of continuous speech (902 accuracy, 1000 words, several speakers, but restricted syntax and semantics). Harpy is an achievement in artificial intelligence, without regard to psychology. Its success, however, makes it worthwhile to ask for its implications for the psychology of speech perception. This paper explores that issue by performing a sufficiency analysis, ie, by constructing a psychological model of speech perception that is faithful to Harpy and then inquiring whether it is acceptable given what we know about human processing capabilities. The strategy for accomplishing this is to select a specific model of basic human cognitive architecture, a production system architecture called HPSA77 that is under investigation independently as a model of cognition; and then to map Harpy into this structure in a way that maintains performance plausibility. The paper (1) presents the production system architecture; (2) presents Harpy; (3) performs the mapping; (4) detours into a consideration of intensity encoding in production systems to solve a problem in the mapping; (5) does the sufficiency analysis; (6) examines what the model says about some human speech phenomena; (7) attempts to state what has been achieved. It seems to the author that a viable and interesting theory of human speech perception has been generated by this exercise, though it has several major difficulties (as noted)."

Neither history, nor philosophy, nor common sense will tell us how these machines will affect us, for they do not do \"work\" as did machines of the Industrial Revolution. Instead of dealing with materials or energy, we are told that they handle \"control\" and \"information\" and even \"intellectual processes.\" There are very few individuals today who doubt that the computer and its relatives are developing rapidly in capability and complexity, and that these machines are destined to play important (though not as yet fully understood) roles in society's future. Though only some of us deal directly with computers, all of us are falling under the shadow of their ever-growing sphere of influence, and thus we all need to understand their capabilities and their limitations. \n \nIt would indeed be reassuring to have a book that categorically and systematically described what all these machines can do and what they cannot do, giving sound theoretical or practical grounds for each judgment. However, although some books have purported to do this, it cannot be done for the following reasons: a) Computer-like devices are utterly unlike anything which science has ever considered---we still lack the tools necessary to fully analyze, synthesize, or even think about them; and b) The methods discovered so far are effective in certain areas, but are developing much too rapidly to allow a useful interpretation and interpolation of results. The abstract theory---as described in this book---tells us in no uncertain terms that the machines' potential range is enormous, and that its theoretical limitations are of the subtlest and most elusive sort. There is no reason to suppose machines have any limitations not shared by man."

                "text": "This book makes a serious effort to cover almost every area of cognitive psychology. There are content chapters on: reaction time, attention, episodic memory, multistore models, semantic memory, psycholinguistics, comprehension, discourse processing, and (by James F. Juola) pattern reception. In addition, there are four chapters on metatheoretical matters and on the various fields that have contributed to information-processing psychology. There is a brief epilogue, terminal bibliography, author index, and subject index. Overall, the book is high level (perhaps a bit too much so) and excellent. It is clearly the best single-volume book I have seen that would serve as a graduate text. Undergraduates would find some of it heavy going. Every chapter is outlined and well organized. The writing is clear. Each chapter begins with a 2-3 page outlined abstract of the chapter. These abstracts are superb. They are so helpful that the reader may feel he can skip reading the chapter! I have one minor and one major criticism. The minor one is that the pattern recognition chapter seems out of place. The major one concerns the first four chapters (over 125 pages). In these chapters a great deal is said about philosophy of science, metatheoretical issues, and the importance of paradigms in science in general as well as in psychology in particular. Obeisance is made to Kuhn. This theme of the importance of paradigms, and especially of changes in paradigms, is carried to some extent throughout the content chapters. I totally disagree. I see no relevance at all of the Kuhnian approach to what psychology was, is now, or will become. This book could have been shortened by almost 100 pages (which would improve it) if the first four chapters were reduced to one, a brief one. Other than that, this is an excellent book."

                "text": "Some scholars believe thot Cognitive Science is the attempt to achieve in artificial systems what has already been achieved in the brain. Others, by contrast, argue that the study of ideal adaptive mechanisms could go on without reference to the brain. The author points out that the brain may not be the ideal cognitive device because of biological limitotions on its capacity. Although it may not be ideal, it is still of major interest to cognitive scientists because of the great interest in the human mind, and, in addition, because at this moment the brain is the most important single reservoir of odoptive mechanisms. \n \n \n \nThe paper discusses several areas of neuroscience which are likely to shed light on mechanisms of adaptation. The study of simple nervous systems is likely to reveal important design principles of cognitive devices. The study of complex nervous systems will, of course, exert a major influence. The study of such systems leads to certain general principles concerning the neural circuits involved in complex odoptive behaviors: (1) There exist innate specialized systems for the learning of many specific behaviors that at first might appeor to be purely cultural. (2) There is no evidence for the existence of any all-purpose computer in the brain. (3) There are many surprising dissociations manifested by the specialized systems in the brain, e.g., a special system for recognition of faces as against other visual patterns. (4) The study of the nervous system enables one to formulate more precise mechanisms for the role of emotion in cognitive function.(5) Some human behoviors con probably be understood poorly or not at all if the neural substrate is not considered. (6) The cognitive systems designed for dealing with ottentionol processes may be among the most complex neural structures which underlie behavior. \n \n \n \nThere are certain other properties of brains that should be kept in mind by the cognitive scientists who are studying human behovior: (1) Brains differ from each other in structure, and it is very likely that the strategy for the solution of certain problems differs from person to person. (2) The presence of certain innate cognitive strategies in the brain may prevent that organism from employing other strategies which might be optimal for other problems. (3) Any theory about a particular cognitive strategy will have implications as to the particular mode of breakdown that might be expected after brain lesions. The study of disordered function from brain disease may thus be a valuable way to test certain cognitive theories."

Many fundamental results in mathematical logic and algorithm theory are presented in summary form, without detailed proofs, and in some cases without any proof. The book is intended for a broad audience of mathematicians and scientists of many specialties who wish to acquaint themselves with the problems of modern cybernetics."

QA4 integrates an omega-order logic language with canonical composition, associative retrieval, and pattern matching of expressions; process structure programming; goal-directed searching; and demons. Thus it provides many useful programming aids. More importantly, however, it provides a semantic framework for common sense reasoning about these problem domains. The interpreter for the language is extraordinarily general, and is therefore an adaptable tool for developing the specialized techniques of intuitive, symbolic reasoning used by the intelligent systems."

The formalism is built out of a number of problem-solving primitives together with a hierarchical multiprocess backtrack control structure.

Under BACKTRACK control structure, the hierarchy of activations of functions previously executed is maintained so that it is possible to revert to any previous state. Thus programs can easily manipulate elaborate hypothetical tentative states. In addition PLANNER uses multiprocessing so that there can be multiple loci of control over the problem-solving."

                "text": "Chapter 6 puts the information covered to that point into direct application. The authors first discuss in some detail a crop identification and acreage estimation case study. This is followed by rather brief discussions of five selected management problems: large area land use inventory and forest, snow-cover, geologic, and water-temperature mapping. Serious students will wish to supplement these with studies of problems pertinent to their own areas of special interest. While much of the information presented is valuable, I see little justification for the final chapter since most of the material in it could well have been worked into other parts of the text. A few imperfections merit comment. Reproduction of some of the aerial-photographs and images does not meet the standards which were imposed on the drawings. For example, the images in Fig. 5-39 are difficult to interpret, although that problem may relate more to the small size of each wave band illustrated than to the quality of photographic reproduction. The areas shown in Fig. 1-7 to illustrate the three spectral regions are not the same scale; further, the same areas (with the same scale problem) are shown in Fig. 5-41. Fig. 6-13 contributes the little to an understanding of the selection or appearance of training areas; nor does Fig.-6-15 to-the selection of test areas. Three chapters have brief but useful summary sections. The other four would have benefited by a similar procedure. While the selection of terms to include in a glossary is a difficult task, a few which are encountered frequently in quantitative remote sensing were omitted, e.g., band ratioing, minimum Euclidean distance elassifier, maximum likelihood classifier smoothing, vector, etc. While there are savings in printing costs to have all color plates grouped on four pages, I found this system awkward to use and disruptive of comprehension. I was surprised, too, that answers to the questions posed after the various sections are not given. Individuals using the text on a self-study basis probably would not have a background adequate to verify their answers without such assistance. These, though, are relatively minor criticisms. Overall, this is one of the best sources of information that I have encountered on the subject of quantitative remote sensing. It would serve well as the textbook for courses at various levels and for students with a wide range of backgrounds. Professionals in the field of remote sensing will wish to add this volume \u2026"
