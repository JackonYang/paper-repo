This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance 's position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256."

We submitted two recognition methods sharing the same underlying image representations defined by a choice of image sampler, local descriptor and global spatial grid. The submitted methods also share the classifier, which is a one-against-rest non-linear Support Vector Machine with chi-square kernel. The methods differ in the way they combine multiple representations (channels). The first method is based on the approach of Zhang et al., where the final similarity measure is the sum of per-channel similarities. The second method employs a genetic algorithm, which is used to determine (on per-class basis) the parameters of the generalized RBF kernel incorporating all the channels, i.e., to estimate the importance of each sampling/description/spatial method for the recognition and to optimize the required level of generalization. Both methods showed superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art submissions."

                "text": "Kernel classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have recently achieved state-of-the art results on several popular datasets like Caltech or Pascal. This was possible by combining the advantages of SVM - convexity and the availability of efficient optimizers, with 'hyperkernels' - linear combinations of kernels computed at multiple levels of image encoding. The use of hyperkernels faces the challenge of choosing the kernel weights, the use of possibly irrelevant, poorly performing kernels, and an increased number of parameters that can lead to overfitting. In this paper we advocate the transition from SVMs to Support Kernel Machines (SKM) - models that estimate both the parameters of a sparse linear combination of kernels, and the parameters of a discriminative classifier. We exploit recent kernel learning techniques, not previously used in computer vision, that show how learning SKMs can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently using Sequential Minimal Optimization. We study kernel learning for several multi-level image encodings for supervised object recognition and report competitive results on several datasets, including INRIA pedestrian, Caltech 101 and the newly created Caltech 256."

We use patch-based feature vectors common in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions. Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions\u00bfa different parameterized function for every image of our training set\u00bfwhereas typically a single global distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome, Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered. We train and test using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

In this paper we examine the feasibility of a data- independent approach to construct such a visual vocabulary, where the feature space is discretized using a regular lattice. Using hashing techniques, only non-empty bins are stored, and fine-grained grids become possible in spite of the high dimensionality of typical feature spaces. Based on this representation, we can explore the structure of the feature space, and obtain state-of-the-art pixelwise classification results. In the case of image classification, we introduce a class-specific feature selection step, which takes the spatial structure of SIFT-like descriptors into account. Results are reported on the Graz02 dataset."

Due to the possibly large intraclass feature variations, using only a single unified kernel-based classifier may not satisfactorily solve the problem. Our approach is to carry out the recognition task with adaptive ensemble kernel machines, each of which is derived from proper localization and regularization. Specifically, for each training sample, we learn a distinct ensemble kernel constructed in a way to give good classification performance for data falling within the corresponding neighborhood. We achieve this effect by aligning each ensemble kernel with a locally adapted target kernel, followed by smoothing out the discrepancies among kernels of nearby data. Our experimental results on various image databases manifest that the technique to optimize local ensemble kernels is effective and consistent for object recognition."

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets."

This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images.

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection."

First, we introduce a descriptor that represents local image shape and its spatial layout, together with a spatial pyramid kernel. These are designed so that the shape correspondence between two images can be measured by the distance between their descriptors using the kernel. Second, we generalize the spatial pyramid kernel, and learn its level weighting parameters (on a validation set). This significantly improves classification performance. Third, we show that shape and appearance kernels may be combined (again by learning parameters on a validation set).\n Results are reported for classification on Caltech-101 and retrieval on the TRECVID 2006 data sets. For Caltech-101 it is shown that the class specific optimization that we introduce exceeds the state of the art performance by more than 10%."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

In most of these works, local patches are modeled as basic building blocks of an image, analogous to words in text documents. In most previous works using the \"bag of words\" models (e.g. [4, 20, 7]), the local patches are assumed to be independent with each other. In this paper, we relax the independence assumption and model explicitly the inter-dependency of the local regions. Similarly to previous work , we represent images as a collection of patches, each of which belongs to a latent \"theme\" that is shared across images as well as categories. We learn the theme distributions and patch distributions over the themes in a hierarchical structure [22]. In particular, we introduce a linkage structure over the latent themes to encode the dependencies of the patches. This structure enforces the semantic connections among the patches by facilitating better clustering of the themes. As a result, our models for object categories tend to be more discriminative than the ones obtained under the independent patch assumption. We show highly competitive categorization results on both the Caltech 4 and Caltech 101 object category datasets. By examining the distributions of the latent themes for each object category, we construct an object taxonomy using the 101 object classes from the Caltech 101 datasets."

In nearest neighbor searching, we are given a set of data points S in real d-dimensional space, R d , and are to build a data structure such that, given any query point q 2 R d , the nearest data point to q can be found eeciently. In general, we are given k 1, and are asked to return the k-nearest neighbors to q in S. In approximate nearest neighbor searching, an error bound 0 is also given. The search algorithm returns k distinct points of S, such that the ratio between the distance to the ith point reported and the true ith nearest neighbor is at most 1 +. Among the features of ANN are the following. It supports k-nearest neighbor searching, by specifying k with the query. It supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching, by specifying an approximation factor 0 with the query. It supports all Minkowski distance metrics, including the L 1 (Manhattan), L 2 (Eu-clidean), and L 1 (Max) metrics. There are no exponential factors in space, implying that the data structure is practical even for very large data sets in high dimensional spaces, irrespective of. ANN is written as a testbed for a class of nearest neighbor searching algorithms, particularly those based on orthogonal decompositions of space. These include k-d trees 3, 4], balanced box-decomposition trees 2] and other related spatial data structures (see Samet 5]). The library supports a number of diierent methods for building search structures. It also supports two methods for searching these structures: standard tree-ordered search 1] and priority search 2]. In priority search, the cells of the data structure are visited in increasing order of distance from the query point. In addition to the library there are two programs provided for testing and evaluating the performance of various search methods. The rst, called ann test, provides a primitive script language that allows the user to generate data sets and query sets, either by reading from a le or randomly through the use of a number of built-in point distributions.

At the heart of this is the notion of an alignment between the shapes to be matched. The transformation necessary for alignment and the remaining differences after alignment are then used to make a comparison. \nA model determines what kind of deformations or alignments are acceptable, and what variation in appearance should remain after alignment. This ties strongly with the idea that the difference in shape is the residual difference, after some family of transformations has been applied for alignment. \nFinding an alignment of a model to a novel object involves search through the space of possible alignments. In many settings this search is quite difficult. This work shows that the search can be approximated by an easier discrete matching problem between key points on a model and a novel object. This is a departure from traditional approaches to deformable template matching that concentrate on analyzing differential models. This thesis presents theories and experiments on searching for, identifying, and using alignments found via discrete matchings. \nIn particular we present a mathematical and ecological motivation for a medium scale descriptor of shape, geometric blur. Geometric blur is an average over transformations of a sparse signal or feature channel, and can be computed using a spatially varying convolution. The resulting shape descriptors are useful for evaluating local shape similarity. Experiments demonstrate their efficacy for image classification and shape correspondence. \nFinding alignments between shapes is formulated as an optimization problem over discrete matchings between feature points in images. Similarity between putative correspondences is measured using geometric blur, and the deformation in the configuration of points is measured by summing over deformations in pairwise relationships. The snatching problem is formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem and approximated with a simple technique. Experimental results indicate that this generic model of local shape and deformation is applicable across a wide variety of object categories, providing good (currently the best known) performance for object recognition and localization on a difficult object recognition benchmark. \nFurthermore this generic object alignment strategy can be used to model variation in images of an object category, identifying the repeated object structures and providing automatic localization of the objects."

Given a set of images of objects from a given class under different viewing conditions, the algorithm identifies corresponding regions depicting the same object part in different images. The technique is based on using the equivalence of corresponding features in different viewing conditions. This equivalence-based matching scheme is not restricted to planar components or affine transformations. As a result, it identifies corresponding parts more accurately and under more general conditions than previous methods. The scheme is general and works for a variety of natural object classes. We demonstrate that using the proposed methods, a dense set of accurate correspondences can be obtained. Experimental comparisons to several known techniques are presented. An application to the problem of invariant object recognition is shown, and additional applications to wide-baseline stereo are discussed."

We say that a signal S1 is \"similar\" to a signal S2 if it is \"easy\" to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2. Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2. This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2. \"Similarity by Composition\" can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between different portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classification, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples."

However, when information on the query distribution is available, the alternative paradigm of designing and analyzing algorithms from the perspective of expected-case performance appears more attractive. We study the approximate nearest neighbor problem from this perspective. As a first stepin this direction, we assume that the query p oints are samp led uniformly from a hypercube that encloses all the data points; however, we make no assumption on the distribution of the data points. We show that with a simple partition tree, called the sliding-midpoint tree, it is possible to achieve linear space and logarithmic query time in the expected case; in contrast, the data structures known to achieve linear space and logarithmic query time in the worst case are complex, and algorithms on them run more slowly in practice. Moreover, we prove that the sliding-midpoint tree achieves optimal expected query time in a certain class of algorithms."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."
