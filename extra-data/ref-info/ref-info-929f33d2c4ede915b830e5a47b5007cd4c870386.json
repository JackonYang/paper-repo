These wave forms when applied to an oscilloscope furnish a display capable of showing rapid changes in the frequency of an electrical signal. Unlike conventional counting\u2010rate meters response to sudden changes in frequency is immediate so that averaging over several cycles is not required. The instrument as constructed operates in the lower audio\u2010frequency range and is being used in the study of the electrical discharge of single fibers of the optic nerve."

At about the same time Rose (1942, 1948) and de Vries (1943) suggested that the inescapable variability in the number of quanta absorbed from a constant light limits the accuracy with which its intensity can be judged, and that the differential threshold is set at as low a level as is compatible with this limit. If this suggestion is correct, one's concept of the nature of a psycho-physical threshold needs to be altered considerably; instead of recalling the all-or-nothing behaviour of a nerve fibre, one should consider the 'threshold' of sensitivity of a galvanometer which is constantly perturbed by noise, or some other example of a limit which is set in accordance with statistical criteria. It has been shown that such a view of the nature of threshold is entirely compatible with the data for the absolute sensitivity of the eye if it is assumed that there is a certain low level of intrinsic retinal noise, even in complete darkness (Barlow, 1956). In the present paper an attempt is made to determine the value of this retinal noise, and to test whether the idea that thresholds are efficient statistical judgements of constant fallibility can be applied to the differential threshold of the human eye at low intensities."

A large region of the mammalian fundus can be surveyed, the eye being in the center of a spherical coordinate system.The design provides measured adaptive and stimulating parameters over the photopic range, sufficient to study intensity, color, timing, and spatial interaction in the retinal mechanisms. Extension to mesopia and scotopia is possible.Associated optically and mechanically are devices for locating, holding, and directing the eye and head of anaesthetized cats (or monkeys). The eye holder carries a small micromanipulator to control the direction and feed of microelectrodes. This arrangement provides stable electrical contact with single optic ganglion cells for long periods.The method does not interfere with normal metabolism and optical functioning of the eye."

                "text": "DR. SELIG HECHT, professor of biophysics at Columbia University, has recently made a tour of American colleges and universities, during which he has lectured to fifteen different Chapters of the Society of the Sigma Xi. His lecture gave some interesting data, arising from his own researches, on the sensitivity of the eye. Under the most favourable conditions, the smallest amount of light which the human eye can detect is 58\u2013148 quanta, representing an energy of 2\u20136 \u00d7 10-10 ergs. This 58\u2013148 quanta is the amount of light falling on the cornea, but only about 10 per cent (5\u201314 quanta) of this is actually absorbed by the retina; the rest is lost by corneal reflexion (4 per cent), absorption by ocular media (50 per cent) and passing on beyond the retina (36 per cent). In the particular experiments described, this 5\u201314 quanta were absorbed by an area of retina which contained about five hundred receptor cells (rods). It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore, that each quantum was absorbed by a separate receptor cell. Chemical studies have shown that one quantum of light changes (bleaches) one molecule of visual purple. The conclusion reached is that we can see a light when the energy from it is sufficient to bleach one molecule of visual purple in each of 5\u201314 separate receptor cells."

The importance of this work makes it especially desirable to define as precisely as possible the actual retinal structures responsible for the spikes recorded, for such questions as the following come to mind in attempting to interpret and evaluate the full significance of Granit's results. How is it possible to get such good insulation in a packed structure like the retina using a 25-\u00b5 electrode? Why are large isolated spikes only found in some spots and not elsewhere? Is it because some typical structure happens to be exceptionally favourably placed for recording, or is the structure a comparatively rare one? Or are the spikes due to the synchronous firing of a patch of retinal cells, and if so, is this normal or pathological?"

The drop in threshold was rather small compared to that found in human dark adaptation, and the final threshold reached was not nearly as low as one would expect in an eye adapted for nocturnal vision. Pirenne (1954) has emphasized that there is a big discrepancy (a factor of 103-106) between the lowest threshold obtained by electro-physiological methods and the much lower thresholds found by psychophysical methods in humans (Hecht, Shlaer & Pirenne, 1942). In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made."

In the past, du Tour (1760) and other scientists found that there was no fusion of the two images, but that always one of a pair of corresponding points suppressed the other. Another view was that of Heine (1900), who held that there was a single common centre which could be stimulated simultaneously by pathways originating from the two retinae. A third view is that of Sherrington (1906), who held that a single sensation arose from the fusion of two sensations which originated separately, one from each visual pathway. Du Tour's theory was put forward before there was any knowledge of depth perception due to disparity of the retinal images. It was considered by both Wheatstone (1838) and Panum (1858), but was thought to be incompatible with data from experiments with stereoscopes, and not to fit in with the idea of disparity as a clue to depth perception. It is proposed here to reconsider du Tour's opinion in relation to the problem of depth perception.

                "text": "Appreciation of the form of the retinal image depends upon a correspondence between the distribution of light on the retina and the distribution of activity among the fibers of the optic nerve. This correspondence may be studied directly by recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers in response to illuminating various parts of the retina. A given optic nerve fiber responds to light only if a particular region of the retina receives illumination. This region is termed the receptive field of that fiber. In a previous paper describing the responses in single optic nerve fibers from the cold-blooded vertebrate eye (Hartline, 1938) it was noted that the receptive fields of the optic nerve fibers are of small but appreciable extent, and that their locations on the retina are fixed. It is the purpose of the present paper to describe further the characteristics of receptive fields, and to discuss some of the spatial factors involved in the excitation of the fibers of the optic nerve. METHOD. The method for recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers from the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates has been described in the previous paper (lot. cit.). An eye is excised, cut open, and small bundles of optic nerve fibers are dissected from the anterior surface of the exposed retina. The action potentials in these bundles are amplified and recorded with an oscillograph. When such a bundle has been split successfully , until only a single active fiber remains, the retina must be searched with a small spot of light to determine the region supplying that fiber. This search is aided by noting the direction, on the retina, from which the nerve fibers in the small bundle come, and by using large spots of light at first to locate the approximate position of the sensitive region. The optical system employed in these experiments has likewise been described. A spot of light of suitable size is projected upon the exposed retina; the coordinates of its position, referred to an arbitrary point of origin on the retina, are obtained from readings of crossed micrometers which control its location.

                "text": "1. Visual acuity varies in a definite manner with the illumination. At low intensities visual acuity increases slowly in proportion to log I; at higher intensities it increases nearly ten times more rapidly in relation to log I; at the highest illuminations it remains constant regardless of the changes in log I. 2. These variations in visual acuity measure the variations in the resolving power of the retina. The retina is a surface composed of discrete rods and cones. Therefore its resolving power depends on the number of elements present in a unit area. The changes in visual acuity then presuppose that the number of elements in the retina is variable. This cannot be true anatomically; therefore it must be assumed functionally. 3. To explain on such a basis the variations of visual acuity, it is postulated that the thresholds of the cones and of the rods are distributed in relation to the illumination in a statistical manner similar to that of other populations. In addition the rods as a whole have thresholds lower than the cones. Then at low intensities the increase in visual acuity depends on the augmentation of the functional rod population which accompanies intensity increase; and at higher intensities the increase in visual acuity depends on the augmentation of the functional cone population. The number of cones per unit foveal area is much greater than the number of rods per unit peripheral area, which accounts for the relative rates of increase of rod and cone visual acuity with intensity. At the highest illuminations all the cones are functional and no increase in visual acuity is possible. 4. If this division into rod visual acuity and cone visual acuity is correct, a completely color-blind person should have only rod visual acuity. It is shown by a study of the data of two such individuals that this is true. 5. The rod and cone threshold distribution has been presented as a purely statistical assumption. It can be shown, however, that it is really a necessary consequence of a photochemical system which has already been used to describe other properties of vision. This system consists of a photosensitive material in reversible relation with its precursors which are its products of decomposition as well. 6. On the basis of these and other data it is shown that a minimal retinal area in the fovea, which can mediate all the steps in such functions as visual acuity, intensity discrimination, and color vision, contains about 540 cones. Certain suggestions with regard to a quantitative mechanism for color vision are then correlated with these findings, and are shown to be in harmony with accurately known phenomena in related fields of physiology."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

                "text": "Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between \u20130.10 and \u20130.24, with a mean value of \u20130.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed."
