Using image sequences acquired simultaneously from multiple views, we recover the 3-D body pose at each time instant without the use of markers. The pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails finding the pose parameters of a graphical human model whose synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. The models used for this purpose are acquired from the images. We use a decomposition approach and a best-first technique to search through the high dimensional pose parameter space. A robust variant of chamfer matching is used as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. We present initial tracking results from a large new Humans-in-Action (HIA) database containing more than 2500 frames in each of four orthogonal views. They contain subjects involved in a variety of activities, of various degrees of complexity, ranging from the more simple one-person hand waving to the challenging two-person close interaction in the Argentine Tango."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

The task is to decide whether or not one or more people are in the scene (detection), to count them, and to label their visible body parts (labeling). \n \nIt is assumed that a motion-tracking front end is supplied: a number of moving features, some belonging to the body and some to the background are tracked for two frames and their position and velocity is supplied (Johansson display). It is not guaranteed that all the body parts are visible, nor that the only motion present is the one of the body. \n \nThe algorithm is based on our previous work [12]; we learn a probabilistic model of the position and motion of body features, and calculate maximum-likelihood labels efficiently using dynamic programming on a triangulated approximation of the probabilistic model. We extend those results by allowing an arbitrary number of body parts to be undetected (e.g. because of occlusion) and by allowing an arbitrary number of noise features to be present. We train and test on walking and dancing sequences for a total of approximately 104 frames. The algorithm is demonstrated to be accurate and efficient."

Our representation for a shape is a discrete set of n points sampled from its internal and external contours. For each of these points, the shape context is a histogram of the relative positions of the n - 1 remaining points. We present two methods for rapid shape retrieval: one that does comparisons based on a small number of shape contexts and another that uses vector quantization in the space of shape contexts. We verify the discriminative power of these methods with tests on the Columbia (COIL-100) 3D object database and the Snodgrass and Vanderwart line drawings. The shape context-based methods are shown to quickly produce an accurate shortlist of candidates suitable for a more exact matching engine in spite of pose variation and occlusion."

In this paper we demonstrate that specific actions can be recognized in long video sequence by matching shape information extracted from individual frames to stored prototypes representing key frames of the action. The matching algorithm is tolerant to substantial deformation between image and prototype and recognizes qualitatively similar image shapes produced by the body postures. The algorithm is applied to the recognition of specific tennis strokes in up to 2 min long video sequences. Using key-frames within the sequence all (1015) forehand strokes are found with no false positives. The backhand strokes are detected with somewhat lower performance. We conclude that this type of approach to action recognition has large potential for application to automatic video analysis and editing."

The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques."

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models and problems with changes of topology. Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \"Metric Mixture\" (M/sup 2/) approach. The M/sup 2/ model has several valuable properties. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M/sup 2/ model in two domains tracking walking people using chamfer distances on binary edge images and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

Unlike previous approaches, the proposed reconstruction method does not assume that the imagery was acquired with a calibrated camera. An analysis is presented which demonstrates that there are a family of solutions to this reconstruction problem parameterized by a single variable. A simple and effective algorithm is proposed for recovering the entire set of solutions by considering the foreshortening of the segments of the model in the image. Results obtained by applying this algorithm to real images are presented."

As a measure of shape equivalence we will use the concept of order structure which in principle can be defined for arbitrary geometric configurations such as points lines and curves. The order structure equivalence of subsets of points and tangent directions of a shape is will be used to establish pointwise correspondence.

We show how to learn a function between paths in the two systems, resolving ambiguities by integrating information over the entire length of a sequence. The basis of this function is a configural and dynamical manifold that summarizes the target system's behaviour. This manifold can be modeled from data with a hidden Markov model having special topological properties that we obtain via entropy minimization. Inference is then a matter of solving for the geodesic on the manifold that best explains the evidence in the cue sequence. We give a closed-form maximum a posteriori solution for geodesics through the learned density space, thereby obtaining optimal paths over the dynamical manifold. These methods give a completely general way to perform inference over time-series; in vision they support analysis, recognition, classification and synthesis of behaviours in linear time. We demonstrate with a prototype that infers 3D from monocular monochromatic sequences (e.g., back-subtractions), without using any articulatory body model. The framework readily accommodates multiple cameras and other sources of evidence such as optical flow or feature tracking."

This survey identifies a number of promising applications and provides an overview of recent developments in this domain. The scope of this survey is limited to work on whole-body or hand motion; it does not include work on human faces. The emphasis is on discussing the various methodologies; they are grouped in 2-D approaches with or without explicit shape models and 3-D approaches. Where appropriate, systems are reviewed. We conclude with some thoughts about future directions."

One of the drawbacks of this approach to date is that the training data is acquired with human intervention where fixed points must be selected by eye from example images. A method is described for generating a similar flexible shape model automatically from real image data. A cubic B-spline is used as the shape vector for training the model. Large training sets are used to generate a robust model of the human profile for use in the labelling and tracking of pedestrians in real-world scenes. Furthermore, an extended model is described which incorporates direction of motion, allowing the extrapolation of direction from shape."

In contrast to 3-D kinematic models, the SPM has fewer singularity problems and does not require detailed knowledge of the 3-D kinematics. We fully characterize the singularities in the SPM and illustrate tracking through singularities using synthetic and real examples with 3-D and 2-D models. Our results demonstrate the significant benefits of the SPM in tracking with a single source of video."

The system is structured as a feedback loop between high and low levels: predictions are made at the semantic level and verifications are sought at the image level. The domain of human motion lends itself to a model-driven analysis, and the system includes a detailed model of the human body. All information extracted from the image is interpreted through a constraint network based on the structure of the human model. A constraint propagation operator is defined and its theoretical properties outlined. An implementation of this operator is described, and results of the analysis system for short image sequences are presented."

We describe a new probability model that can jointly cluster data and learn mixtures of nonuniform, smooth deformation fields. Our fields are based on low-frequency wavelets, so they use very few parameters to model a wide range of smooth deformations (unlike, e.g., factor analysis, which uses a large number of parameters to model deformations). In spirit, our ideas are most similar to the idea of separating content from style published by Tenenbaum and Freeman. However, our models do not need labeled data for training, and thus allow for unsupervised separation of appearance from deformation. We give results on handwritten digit recognition and face recognition."

We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."
