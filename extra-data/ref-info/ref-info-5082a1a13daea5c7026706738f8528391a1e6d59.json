An ideal summarization system would understand each document and generate an appropriate summary directly from the results of that understanding. A more practical approach to this problem results in the use of an approximation: viewing summarization as a problem analogous to statistical machine translation. The issue then becomes one of generating a target document in a more concise language from a source document in a more verbose language. This paper presents results on experiments using this approach, in which statistical models of the term selection and term ordering are jointly applied to produce summaries in a style learned from a training corpus."

The task of summary sentence decomposition is to deduce whether a summary sentence is constructed by reusing the original text and to identify reused phrases. Specifically, the decomposition program needs to answer three questions for a given summary sentence: (1) Is this summary sentence constructed by reusing the text in the original document? (2) If so, what phrases in the sentence come from the original document? and (3) From where in the document do the phrases come? Solving the decomposition problem can lead to better text generation techniques for summarization. Decomposition can also provide large training and testing corpora for extraction-based summarizers. We propose a hidden Markov model solution to the decomposition problem. Evaluations show that the proposed algorithm performs well."

We demonstrate that even the most basic version of the system, which is given no syntactic information (no PoS or NE tags, or dependencies) or desired compression length, performs surprisingly well: around 30% of the compressions from a large test set could be regenerated. We compare the LSTM system with a competitive baseline which is trained on the same amount of data but is additionally provided with all kinds of linguistic features. In an experiment with human raters the LSTMbased model outperforms the baseline achieving 4.5 in readability and 3.8 in informativeness."

We address this problem and present a method to automatically build a compression corpus with hundreds of thousands of instances on which deletion-based algorithms can be trained. In our corpus, the syntactic trees of the compressions are subtrees of their uncompressed counterparts, and hence supervised systems which require a structural alignment between the input and output can be successfully trained. We also extend an existing unsupervised compression method with a learning module. The new system uses structured prediction to learn from lexical, syntactic and other features. An evaluation with human raters shows that the presented data harvesting method indeed produces a parallel corpus of high quality. Also, the supervised system trained on this corpus gets high scores both from human raters and in an automatic evaluation setting, significantly outperforming a strong baseline."

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier."

The models have a generation and a conditioning aspect. The generation of the translation is modelled with a target Recurrent Language Model, whereas the conditioning on the source sentence is modelled with a Convolutional Sentence Model. Through various experiments, we show first that our models obtain a perplexity with respect to gold translations that is > 43% lower than that of stateof-the-art alignment-based translation models. Secondly, we show that they are remarkably sensitive to the word order, syntax, and meaning of the source sentence despite lacking alignments. Finally we show that they match a state-of-the-art system when rescoring n-best lists of translations."

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT\u201914 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT\u201914 contest task."

The system then uses a statistical hierarchical model of text production in order to drop non-important syntactic and discourse constituents so as to generate coherent, grammatical document compressions of arbitrary length. The system outperforms both a baseline and a sentence-based compression system that operates by simplifying sequentially all sentences in a text.

                "text": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder\u2010Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases."

The measures count the number of overlapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, and word pairs between the computer-generated summary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries created by humans. This paper introduces four different ROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summarization evaluation package and their evaluations. Three of them have been used in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scale summarization evaluation sponsored by NIST."

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure."

                "text": "A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

In addition to being an open source tool that is extremely easy to compile and run, Z-MERT is also agnostic regarding the evaluation metric, fully configurable, and requires no modification to work with any decoder. We describe Z-MERT and review its features, and report the results of a series of experiments that examine the tool's runtime. We establish that Z-MERT is extremely efficient, making it well-suited for time-sensitive pipelines. The experiments also provide an insight into the tool's runtime in terms of several variables (size of the development set, size of produced N-best lists, etc)."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."
