This paper presents a computer assisted document synthesis system based on the grammar-based structure analysis. The system is designed to accomplish the analysis and synthesis of table form documents cooperatively by a user and computer; namely, the user interprets the document meaning and gives the entry data to be filled in, while the computer detects the boxes formed by horizontal and vertical rules and determines the logical relations of adjacent boxes. First, the document is decomposed into a set of boxes and they are classified semi-automatically into four types: blank, insertion, indication and explanation. Then the box relations between the indication box and its associated entry one are analyzed based on the semantic and geometric knowledge defined in the document structure grammar. Finally, the system generates LATEX codes of the synthesized documents whose blank and insertion boxes are filled with the text and image data given by user. Experimental results have shown that the system analyzed successfully several kinds of table forms and yielded synthesized documents as expected."

A precise definition of \"tabularity\" remains elusive because some bureaucratic forms, multicolumn text layouts, and schematic drawings share many characteristics of tables. There are significant differences between typeset tables, electronic files designed for display of tables, and tables in symbolic form intended for information retrieval. Although most research to date has addressed the extraction of low-level geometric information from scanned raster images of paper tables, the recent trend toward the analysis of tables in electronic form may pave the way to a higherl evel of table understanding. \n \nRecent research on table composition and table analysis has improved ourunde rstanding of the distinction between the logical and physical structures of tables, and has led to improved formalisms for modeling tables. The present study indicates that progress on half-a-dozen specific research issues would open the door to using existing paper and electronic tables for database update, tabular browsing, structured information retrieval through graphical and audio interfaces, multimedia table editing, and platform-independent display. \n \nAlthough tables are not a conventional format for conveying the primary content of technical papers, here we attempt to subdue our natural garrulity by adopting this genre to communicate what we have to say about tables entirely in tabular form."

First, the document image is transformed into a layout graph whose nodes and edges represent document entities and their interrelations respectively. This graph is subsequently rewritten using a set of rules designed based on a priori document knowledge and general formatting conventions. The resulting graph provides a logical view of the document content. It can be parsed to provide general format analysis information."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

A new method for the logical structure extraction of form document is proposed in this paper. The algorithm of it consists of three phases: global division of the whole document, local logical structure analysis and global re- division of the whole document. GLG method emphasizes the global layout structure analysis and has higher accuracy. It is robust for treating with the accidental direct adjacent relationship between two irrelated cells. In addition, a logical structure tree is proposed to represent the logical structure of a form document."
