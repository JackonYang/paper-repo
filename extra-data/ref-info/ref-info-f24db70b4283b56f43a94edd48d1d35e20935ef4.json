How do we accomplish this visual-cognitive feat? The commonly held explanation is known as the schema hypothesis, according to which a visual scene is rapidly identified as a member of a semantic category, and predictions generated from the scene category are then used to aid subsequent object identification. In this paper I will first outline and offer a critique of the evidence that has been taken to support the schema hypothesis. I will then offer an alternative framework for understanding scene processing, which I will call the local-processing hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes a modular, informationally-encapsulated architecture, and explicitly includes the role of covert visual attention in scene processing."

Depending on the roles they play in organizing the perception of a scene, different visual properties may require different amounts of attention to be incorporated into a mental representation of the scene. The goal of this study was to compare how three visual properties of scenes, colour, object position, and object presence, are encoded in visual memory. We used a variation on the change detection \u201cflicker\u201d task and measured the time to detect scene changes when: (1) a cue was provided regarding the type of change; and, (2) no cue was provided. We hypothesized that cueing would enhance the processing of visual properties that require more attention to be encoded into scene representations, whereas cueing would not have an effect for properties that are readily or automatically encoded in visual memory. In Experiment 1, we found that there was a cueing advantage for colour changes, but not for position or presence changes. In Experiment 2, we found the same cueing effect regardless of whether the colour change altered the configuration of the scene or not. These results are consistent with the idea that properties that typically help determine the configuration of the scene, for example, position and presence, are better encoded in scene representations than are surface properties such as colour."

However, the question remains of how processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment 1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale. The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations."

Participants decided whether a briefly presented and masked picture matched a test name. For pictures and words referring to similarly shaped objects, semantic color similarity (SCS) was present when picture and word shared the same prototypical color (e.g., purple apple followed by cherry). Perceptual color similarity (PCS) was present when the surface color of the picture matched the prototypical color of the named object (e.g., purple apple followed by blueberry). Response interference was primarily due to SCS, despite the fact that participants based similarity ratings on PCS. When uncolored objects were used, SCS interference still occurred, implying that the influence of SCS did not depend on the presence of surface color. The results indicate that, relative to surface color, stored color knowledge was more influential in object recognition."

Object identification, at least at fine levels of discrimination, may require the application of top-down knowledge to resolve ambiguous image information. Utilizing top-down knowledge, however, may require the initial rapid access of abstract object categories based on low-level image cues. Does object localization require a different set of operating principles than object identification or is category determination also part of the perception of depth and spatial layout? Three-dimensional graphics movies of objects and their cast shadows are used to argue that identifying perceptual categories is important for determining the relative depths of objects. Processes that can identify the causal class (e.g. the kind of material) that generates the image data can provide information to determine the spatial relationships between surfaces. Changes in the blurriness of an edge may be characteristically associated with shadows caused by relative motion between two surfaces. The early identification of abstract events such as moving object/shadow pairs may also be important for depth from shadows. Knowledge of how correlated motion in the image relates to an object and its shadow may provide a reliable cue to access such event categories."

Do people with low visual acuity benefit more from color? Three experiments measured reaction time (RT) and accuracy for naming food objects displayed in 4 types of images: gray scale or color, and high or low spatial resolution (produced by blur). Normally sighted Ss had faster RTs with color, but the improvement was not significantly greater for images with low spatial resolution. Low vision subjects were also faster with color, but the difference did not depend significantly on acuity. In 2 additional experiments, it was found that the faster RTs for color stimuli were related to objects' prototypicality but not to their color diagnosticity. It was concluded that color does improve object recognition, and the mechanism is probably sensory rather than cognitive in origin."

Here we explore whether this observed difference in contrast sensitivity reflects a real difference in the components of chrominance and luminance in natural scenes. For this purpose a digital set of 29 hyperspectral images of natural scenes was acquired and its spatial frequency content analyzed in terms of chrominance and luminance defined according to existing models of the human cone responses and visual signal processing. The statistical 1/f amplitude spatial-frequency distribution is confirmed for a variety of chromatic conditions across the visible spectrum. Our analysis suggests that natural scenes are relatively rich in high-spatial-frequency chrominance information that does not appear to be transmitted by the human visual system. This result is unlikely to have arisen from errors in the original measurements. Several reasons may combine to explain a failure to transmit high-spatial-frequency chrominance: (a) its minor importance for primate visual tasks, (b) its removal by filtering applied to compensate for chromatic aberration of the eye's optics, and (c) a biological bottleneck blocking its transmission. In addition, we graphically compare the ratios of luminance to chrominance measured by our hyperspectral camera and those measured psychophysically over an equivalent spatial-frequency range."

These target images were preceded by prime images of the same scene sans critical objects, or by control primes or different-scene primes. Reaction times were faster following same-scene primes than following the various control and different-scene primes. Same-scene facilitation was obtained with color primes, line-drawing primes, and primes with shifted views. The effect occurred with natural scenes having gist and simple artificial scenes having little or no gist. The results indicate that prime-induced representations influence the perception of spatial layout in pictures."

Using a feature listing and typicality measure, objects were identified as either high in color diagnosticity or low in color diagnosticity. According to the color diagnosticity hypothesis, color should more strongly influence the recognition of high color diagnostic (HCD) objects (e.g., a banana) than the recognition of low color diagnostic (LCD) objects (e.g., a lamp). This prediction was supported by results from classification, naming, and verification experiments, in which subjects were faster to identify color versions of HCD objects than they were to identify achromatic versions and incongruent color versions. In contrast, subjects were no faster to identify color versions of LCD objects than they were to identify achromatic and incongruent color versions. Moreover, when shape information was degraded but color information preserved, subjects were less impaired in their recognition of degraded HCD objects than of degraded LCD objects, relative to their nondegraded versions. Collectively, these results suggest that color plays a role in the recognition of HCD objects."

Of interest is whether the identification of the target object depends on the identification of the scene or the identification of other diagnostic objects in the scene. Experiment 1 indicated objects are more difficult to identify when located in an \"episodically\" inconsistent background even when the same diagnostic objects are present in both inconsistent and consistent backgrounds. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the degree to which noncued (cohort) objects are consistent with the target object has no effect on the object identification task. Experiment 3 showed consistent episodic background information facilitated object identification and inconsistent episodic background information did not interfere relative to \"nonsense\" backgrounds roughly equated on visual characteristics.

We found that color had no effect on object recognition but did facilitate object naming, even when color was redundant for discrimination. This did not apply to naming abstract shapes.

However, when the paradigm was modified to control for response bias (Experiments 2 and 3) or when response bias was eliminated by means of a forced-choice procedure (Experiment 4), no such advantage obtained. When an additional source of biasing information was eliminated by presenting the object label after the scene (Experiments 3 and 4), there was either no effect of consistency (Experiment 4) or an inconsistent object advantage (Experiment 3).

A series of high-pass and low-pass spatially filtered versions of a visual scene were generated. Observers' ratings of these filtered versions of the scene for perceived image quality indicated that quality was determined both by the bandwidth of spatial information and the presence of high-spatial-frequency edge information. When sequences of three different versions of the scene were presented over an interval of 120 ms the perceived quality of the resulting composite image was determined both from the ratings of the individual components of that sequence and from the order in which these components were presented. When the order of spatial information in a sequence moved from coarse to fine detail the perceived quality of the composite image was significantly better than when the order moved from fine to coarse. This evidence of a coarse-to-fine bias in pattern integration was further investigated with a detection paradigm. The pattern of errors once again indicated that temporal integration of spatial information was superior when a coarse-to-fine mode of information delivery was employed. Taken together the data indicate that the pattern-integration mechanism has an inherent order bias and does not accumulate spatial information so efficiently when the \u2018natural\u2019 coarse-to-fine order is violated."

How do processes of object and scene categorisation use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales? One scenario suggests that recognition should use coarse blobs before fine-scale edges because scale usage is perceptually determined. However, perceptual determination neglects one important aspect of any recognition task: the information demands of the considered classification of the input. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that scale usage could be flexibly determined by the diagnosticity of scale-specific cues for different categorisations of scenes and faces."

Objects were drawn from classes with either structurally similar or structurally dissimilar exemplars. In Experiment 1a, object naming was facilitated by both congruent surface colour and photographic detail, with the effects of these two variables combining under-additively. In addition incongruent colour disrupted naming accuracy. These effects tended to be larger on objects from structurally similar classes than on objects from structurally dissimilar classes. Experiment 1b examined superordinate classification. There were again advantages due to congruent colour and photographic detail on responses to objects from both structurally similar and structurally dissimilar classes. Incongruent colour disrupted classification accuracy on structurally distinct but not structurally similar items. For structurally similar items, the advantages of congruent surface attributes on classification were smaller than on naming, but this was not the case for structurally dissimilar items. Experiment 2 examined subordinate classification of structurally similar objects. Now effects of congruent and incongruent colour, but not of photographic detail, were found. Experiment 3 showed that congruent and incongruent colour effects occur only when the colours occupy the internal surfaces of objects. The results suggest that surface details can affect object recognition and naming, depending upon: (1) the degree to which objects must be differentiated for a correct response to be made, and (2) the nature of the rate-limiting process determining performance."

Edges have sometimes been operationalized as line drawings, which can be an invalid and misleading practice. A new method for evaluating the utility of edge information, operationalized as the outputs of a local, signal-based edge extractor, is introduced. With 1-s exposures, the accuracy of identifying objects in the edge images was found to be less than half that wit h color photographs. Therefore, edge s are far from bein g sufficient fo r object recognition. Alternative approaches to the problem of interpreting stimulus informatio n are discussed. As with any complex process, initial research on object recognition ha s bee n conducte d withi n framework s that simplify som e aspect s o f th e process . Simplificatio n is important and necessary during initial stages of research. However, simplified frameworks must be elaborated upon or replaced on the road to a fuller understanding. In this article, we argue that the current concept of edge-based representations should be replaced because it is a simplification that obscures significant problems involved in the interpretation of stimulus information during object recognition. We will use Biederman's (1987) recognition-by-components (RBC ) model t o introduce ou r arguments because edge-based representations are central to it and because it has bee n a n importan t mode l o f objec t recognitio n i n psychology.

                "text": "It has recently become apparent that if face images are degraded by spatial quantisation, or block averaging, there is a nonlinear acceleration of the decline in accuracy of recognition as block size increases. This suggests recognition requires a critical minimum range of object spatial frequencies. Two experiments were performed to clarify the phenomenon. In experiment 1, the speed and accuracy of recognition for six frontoparallel photographs of faces were measured. After familiarisation training sessions, the images were shown for 100 ms with 11, 21, and 42 pixels per face, horizontally measured. Transformations calculated to remove the same range of spatial frequencies were performed by means of quantisation, a Fourier low-pass filter, and Gaussian blurring. Although accuracy declined and speed increased in a significant, nonlinear manner in all cases as the image quality was reduced, it did so at a faster rate for the quantised images. In experiment 2, faces rated as being typical were shown at 9, 12, 23, and 45 pixels per face and with appropriate Fourier low-pass versions. The nonlinear decline was confirmed and it was shown that it could not be attributed to a ceiling effect. A further condition allowed quantised and Fourier low-pass conditions to be compared with an unstructured-noise condition of equal strength to that of the quantised images. These gave comparable, but slightly less impaired, recognition than the quantised images. It can be inferred from these results that the removal of a critical range of at least 8\u201316 cycles per face of information explains the step decline in recognition seen with quantised images. However, the decline found with quantised images is reinforced by internal masking from pixelisation."

                "text": "In general, frame theories are theories about the representation and use of knowledge for pattern recognition. In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the \u2018parahippocampal place area\u2019 (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment."

We report here that observers reliably distinguish the direction of motion of a colour pattern presented for only 17 milliseconds, provided that the contrast is several times the threshold value (the contrast needed to detect the presence of the pattern). A control experiment, in which a static luminance 'mask' is added to the moving colour pattern, proves that discrimination of the direction of motion of these brief stimuli is colour-specific. The mask drastically impairs discrimination of the direction of motion of a luminance pattern, but it has little effect on a colour pattern. We conclude that the human visual system contains colour-specific motion-detection mechanisms that are capable of analysing very brief signals."

Texture perception, assumed to be carried by the color-opponent system, and motion and depth perception, ascribed to the broad-band pathway, were all found to be compromised but not abolished at isoluminance. Correspondingly, both the color-opponent and the broad-band systems were affected at isoluminance, but the activity of the neurons in neither system was abolished. These results suggest that impairment of visual capacities at isoluminance cannot be uniquely attributed to either of these systems and that isoluminant stimuli are inappropriate for the psychophysical isolation of these pathways."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue\u2010yellow and red\u2010green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low\u2010pass characteristics, with no low\u2010frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red\u2010green and blue\u2010yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings."

The highest resolvable spatial frequency was set at 15 cycles per face width (cycles fw\u22121). Recognition was much less accurate for images that contained only the low spatial frequencies (up to 5 cycles fw\u22121) than for images that contained only spatial frequencies higher than 5 cycles fw\u22121. For faces HP filtered above 8 cycles fw\u22121, recognition was almost as accurate as for faces LP filtered below 8 cycles fw\u22121, although the energy content of the latter greatly exceeded that of the former. These findings show that information conveyed by the higher spatial frequencies is not redundant. Rather, it is sufficient by itself to ensure recognition."

                "text": "One basic principle of science, which typically applies to psychology, suggests that one should never seek to explain a psychological fact by a mechanism at a higher level if it can be explained by one at a lower level (Morgan, 1894). This seems to be a reasonable principle, and it compels us to attempt to specify and understand the nature of the preliminary operations that underlie a given process. Such a principle is quite relevant to the problem of face perception, and it is with early visual processes, as well as their implications for later operations, that the present chapter will be concerned. It would be misleading, however, to begin with the idea that one can account for most of the processes underlying perception by considering only these early processes, and this is especially true of face perception. For one thing, perception is a process resulting from the interaction of the incoming information and mental states or cerebral structures, and it is therefore necessary to understand the nature and characteristics of this interaction to explain perceptual processes. For another, the human face is an extremely familiar multidimensional pattern, and our frequent exposure to such a stimulus has enabled us to develop certain processing mechanisms, which some authors (e.g, Goldstein & Chance, 1981) have referred to as \u201cschemata,\u201d that allow access to consistent dimensions which facilitate perception and memory."
