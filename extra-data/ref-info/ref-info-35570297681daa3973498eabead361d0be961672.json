Our basic premise is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature alone. Instead, we present an algorithm that integrates evidence in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part of our method is the combination of local and global cues via probabilistic top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows examining and comparing object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other. In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate on very small training sets."

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

Our basic assumption is that people tend to take on certain canonical poses, even when performing unusual activities like throwing a baseball or figure skating. We build a person detector that quite accurately detects and localizes limbs of people in lateral walking poses. We use the estimated limbs from a detection to build a discriminative appearance model; we assume the features that discriminate a figure in one frame will discriminate the figure in other frames. We then use the models as limb detectors in a pictorial structure framework, detecting figures in unrestricted poses in both previous and successive frames. We have run our tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames, and present and apply a methodology for evaluating tracking on such a large scale. We test our tracker on real sequences including a feature-length film, an hour of footage from a public park, and various sports sequences. We find that we can quite accurately automatically find and track multiple people interacting with each other while performing fast and unusual motions."

The proposed model employs a Boltzmann distribution to capture the prior of local deformation, and embeds it into a Markov network which can be learned from data. A mean field variational analysis of this model provides computationally efficient algorithms for computing the likelihood of image observations and facilitate fast model training. Based on that, effective detection and tracking algorithms for deformable objects are proposed and applied to pedestrian detection and tracking. The proposed method has several advantages. Firstly, it captures local deformation well and thus is robust to occlusions and clutter. In addition, it is computationally tractable. Moreover, it divides deformation into local deformation and global deformation, then conquers them by combining bottom-up and top-down methodologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for deformable objects."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

The face, torso, legs and hands are detected in cluttered scenes using boosted body part detectors trained by AdaBoost. Body configurations are assembled from the detected parts using RANSAC, and a coarse heuristic is applied to eliminate obvious outliers. An a priori mixture model of upper-body configurations is used to provide a pose likelihood for each configuration. A joint-likelihood model is then determined by combining the pose, part detector and corresponding skin model likelihoods. The assembly with the highest likelihood is selected by RANSAC, and the elbow positions are inferred. This paper also illustrates the combination of skin colour likelihood and detection likelihood to further reduce false hand and face detections."

There is significant overhead needed in the development of such systems as well as the a priori assumption that the object dynamics can be described with such a dynamical model. This paper describes a new pattern classification technique for object detection in video sequences that uses a rich, overcomplete dictionary of wavelet features to describe an object class. Unlike previous work where a small subset of features was selected from the dictionary, this system does no feature selection and learns the model in the full 1,326 dimensional feature space. Comparisons using different sized sets of several types of features are given. We extend this representation into the time domain without assuming any explicit model of dynamics. This data driven approach produces a model of the physical structure and short-time dynamical characteristics of people from a training set of examples; no assumptions are made about the motion of people, just that short sequences characterize their dynamics sufficiently for the purposes of detection. One of the main benefits of this approach is that transient false positives are reduced. This technique compares favorably with the static detection approach and could be applied to other object classes. We also present a real-time version of one of our static people detection systems."

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

The video sequence need not have any form of special background. Animals are modeled as a 2D kinematic chain of rectangular segments, where the number of segments and the topology of the chain are unknown. The system detects possible segments, clusters segments whose appearance is coherent over time, and then builds a spatial model of such segment clusters. The resulting representation of the spatial configuration of the animal in each frame can be seen either as a track - in which case the system described should be viewed as a generalized tracker, that is capable of modeling objects while tracking them - or as the source of an appearance model which can be used to build detectors for the particular animal. This is because knowing a video sequence is temporally coherent - i.e. that a particular animal is present through the sequence - is a strong supervisory signal. The method is shown to be successful as a tracker on video sequences of real scenes showing three different animals. For the same reason it is successful as a tracker, the method results in detectors that can be used to find each animal fairly reliably within the Corel collection of images."

To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

The review is part of a projected book that is intended to cross-fertilize ideas about motion representation between the animation and computer vision communities. The review confines itself to the earlier stages of motion, focusing on tracking and motion synthesis; future material will cover activity representation and motion generation. In general, we take the position that tracking does not necessarily involve (as is usually thought) complex multimodal inference problems. Instead, there are two key problems, both easy to state. The first is lifting, where one must infer the configuration of the body in three dimensions from image data. Ambiguities in lifting can result in multimodal inference problem, and we review what little is known about the extent to which a lift is ambiguous. The second is data association, where one must determine which pixels in an image Full text available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0600000005"

We formulate the estimation problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem and apply the extragradient method, yielding an algorithm with linear convergence using simple gradient and projection calculations. The projection step can be solved using combinatorial algorithms for min-cost quadratic flow. This makes the approach an efficient alternative to formulations based on reductions to a quadratic program (QP). We present experiments on two very different structured prediction tasks: 3D image segmentation and word alignment, illustrating the favorable scaling properties of our algorithm."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

                "text": "Maximum margin structured learning (MMSL) has recently gained recognition within the machine learning community as a tractable method for large scale learning. However, most current methods are limited in terms of scalability, convergence, or memory requirements. The original Structured SMO method proposed in (Taskar et al., 2003) is slow to converge, particularly for Markov networks of even medium treewidth. Similarly, dual exponentiated gradient techniques suffer from sublinear convergence as well as often large memory requirements. Recently, (Taskar et al., 2006) have looked into saddle-point methods for optimization and have succeeded in efficiently solving several problems that would have otherwise had intractable memory requirements. We propose an alternative gradient based approach using a regularized risk formulation of MMSL derived by placing the constraints into the objective to create a convex function in w. This objective is then optimized by a direct generalization of gradient descent, popular in convex optimization, called the subgradient method (Shor, 1985). The abundance of literature on subgradient methods makes this algorithm a decidedly convenient choice. In this case, it is well known that the subgradient method is guaranteed linear convergence when the stepsize is chosen to be constant. Furthermore, this algorithm becomes the well-studied Greedy Projection algorithm of (Zinkevich, 2003) in the online setting. Using tools developed in (Hazan et al., 2006), we can show that the risk of this online algorithm with respect to the prediction loss grows only sublinearly in time. Perhaps more importantly, the implementation of this algorithm is simple and has intuitive appeal since an integral part of the computation comes from running the inference algorithm being trained in the inner loop. In what follows, we review the basic formulation of maximum margin structured learning as a convex programming problem before deriving the convex objective and showing how its subgradients can be computed utilizing the specialized inference algorithm inherent to the problem. We finish with theoretical guarantees and some experimental results in two domains: sequence labeling for optical character recognition; and imitation learning for path planning in mobile robot navigation. The former problem is well known to MMSL, but the latter is new to this domain. Indeed, although there is a tractable polynomial sized quadratic programming representation for the problem (Ratliff et al., 2006), solving it directly using one of the previously proposed methods would be intractable practically for reasons similar to those that arise in directly solving the linear programming formulation of Markov Decision Processes."
