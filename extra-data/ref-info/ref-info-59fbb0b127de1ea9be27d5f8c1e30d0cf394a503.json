Recently it has been shown that their algorithm is related to neural networks of Hopfield and Tank, and that they both can be understood as the semiclassical approximation to statistical mechanics of related physical models. The main point of the elastic net algorithm is seen to be in the way one deals with the constraints when evaluating the effective cost function (free energy in the thermodynamic analogy), and not in its geometric foundation emphasized originally by Durbin and Willshaw. As a consequence, the elastic net algorithm is a special case of the more general physically based computations and can be generalized to a large class of nongeometric problems. In this paper we further elaborate on this observation, and generalize the elastic net to the quadratic assignment problem. We work out in detail its special case, the graph matching problem, because it is an important problem with many applications in computational vision and neural modeling. Simulation results on random graphs, and on structured (hand-designed) graphs of moderate size (20-100 nodes) are discussed."

They can be applied for example in the output of the visual processes to reconstruct surfaces from sparse and noisy depth data, or to integrate early vision processes to label physical discontinuities. Drawbacks of MRFs models have been the computational complexity of the implementation and the difficulty in estimating the parameters of the model. This paper derives deterministic approximations to MRFs models. One of the considered models is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non convexity (GNC) algorithm. This model can be applied to smooth a field preserving its discontinuities. A new model is then proposed: it allows the gradient of the field to be enhanced at the discontinuities and smoothed elsewhere. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the mean field theory, that is a well known statistical mechanics technique. A fast, parallel, and iterative algorithm to solve the deterministic equations of the two models is presented, together with experiments on synthetic and real images. The algorithm is applied to the problem of surface reconstruction is in the case of sparse data. A fast algorithm ismore\u00a0\u00bb also described that solves the problem of aligning the discontinuities of different visual models with intensity edges via integration.\u00ab\u00a0less"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The feature of interest can described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image content, by evaluating the energy function and accordingly altering its parameter values. A gradient maximization technique is used to optimize the placement and shape of the deformable template to fit the desired anatomical feature. The final parameter values can be used as descriptors for the feature. Measurements of intensity values within a region of the template can be used as inputs to a medical diagnostic system. We have developed a Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) based image analysis program which employs the technique of deformable templates to localize features in dual energy CT images. Measurements can then be automatically made which can be used for maintenance of patients suffering from bone loss and abnormal marrow fat content. This system has been successfully tested on 552 (69 \u00d7 8) images and is currently in use at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Statistical comparisons between the system and previously used manual techniques show that their performances are practically equivalent and that the system has several advantages over the human operator, for example, consistency, accuracy and cost."

We consider the graph partition and the travelling salesman problems. The key new ingredient is a reduction of solution space by one dimension by using graded neurons, thereby avoiding the destructive redundancy that has plagued these problems when using straightforward neural network techniques. This approach maps the problems onto Potts glass rather than spin glass theories. A systematic prescription is given for estimating the phase transition temperatures in advance, which facilitates the choice of optimal parameters. This analysis, which is performed for both serial and synchronous updating of the mean field theory equations, makes it possible to consistently avoid chaotic behavior.When exploring this new technique numerically we find the results very encouraging; the quality of the solutions are in parity with those obtained by using optimally tuned simulated annealing heuristics. Our numerical study, which for TSP extends to 200-city problems, exhibits an impressive level of parameter insensitivity. (Less)"

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The rapidity with which we can discriminate the inside from the outside of a figure suggests that at least this step in the process may be performed in visual cortex by a large number of neurons in several different areas working together in parallel. We have attempted to simulate this collective computation by designing a network of simple processing units that receives two types of information: bottom-up input from the image containing the outlines of a figure, which may be incomplete, and a top-down attentional input that biases one part of the image to be the inside of the figure. No presegmentation of the image was assumed. Two methods for performing the computation were explored: gradient descent, which seeks locally optimal states, and simulated annealing, which attempts to find globally optimal states by introducing noise into the computation. For complete outlines, gradient descent was faster, but the range of input parameters leading to successful performance was very narrow. In contrast, simulated annealing was more robust: it worked over a wider range of attention parameters and a wider range of outlines, including incomplete ones. Our network model is too simplified to serve as a model of human performance, but it does demonstrate that one global property of outlines can be computed through local interactions in a parallel network. Some features of the model, such as the role of noise in escaping from nonglobal optima, may generalize to more realistic models."

This type of deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learns much faster than the equivalent stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM), but since the learning procedure for DBM's is only based on an analogy with SBM's, there is no existing proof that it performs gradient descent in any function, and it has only been justified by simulations. By using the appropriate interpretation for the way in which a DBM represents the probability of an output vector given an input vector, it is shown that the DBM performs steepest descent in the same function as the original SBM, except at rare discontinuities. A very simple way of forcing the weights to become symmetrical is also described, and this makes the DBM more biologically plausible than back-propagation (Werbos 1974; Parker 1985; Rumelhart et al. 1986)."

The volume is calculated explicitly as a function of the storage ratio, alpha =p/N, of the value kappa (>0) of the product of the spin and the magnetic field at each site and of the magnetisation, m. Here m may vary between 0 (no correlation) and 1 (completely correlated). The capacity increases with the correlation between patterns from alpha =2 for correlated patterns with kappa =0 and tends to infinity as m tends to 1. The calculations use a saddle-point method and the order parameters at the saddle point are assumed to be replica symmetric. This solution is shown to be locally stable. A local iterative learning algorithm for updating the interactions is given which will converge to a solution of given kappa provided such solutions exist."

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

The most important of these come from the fact that this equation is equivalent to a certain gradient flow on the space of orthogonal matrices. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of this equation as an analog computer. For example, it is shown how to map the data associated with a linear programming problem into H(0) and N in such a way as to have H=(H(H,N)) evolve to a solution of the linear programming problem. This result can be applied to find systems that solve a variety of generic combinatorial optimization problems, and it also provides an algorithm for diagonalizing symmetric matrices.<<ETX>>"

GRBF networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines, but are also closely related to several pattern recognition methods and neural network algorithms.

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces."

                "text": "A winner-take-all mechanism is a device that determines the identity and amplitude of its largest input (Feldman and Ballard 1982). Such mechanisms have been proposed for various brain functions. For example, a theory for visual velocity estimate (Grzywacz and Yuille 1989) postulates that a winner-take-all selects the strongest responding cell in the cortex's middle temporal area (MT). This theory proposes a circuitry that links the directionally selective cells in the primary visual cortex to MT cells, making them velocity selective. Generally, several velocity cells would respond, but only the winner would determine the perception. In another theory, a winner-take-all guides the spotlight of attention to the most salient image part (Koch and Ullman 1985). Also, such mechanisms improve the signal-to-noise ratios of VLSI emulations of brain functions (Lazzaro and Mead 1989). Although computer algorithms for winner-take-all mechanisms exist (Feldman and Ballard 1982; Koch and Ullman 1985), good biologically motivated models do not. A candidate for a biological mechanism is lateral (mutual) inhibition (Hartline and Ratliff 1957). In some theoretical mutual-inhibition networks, the inhibition sums linearly to the excitatory inputs and the result is passed through a threshold non linearity (Hadeler 1974). However, these networks work only if the difference between winner and losers is large (Koch and Ullman 1985). We propose an alternative network, in which the output of each element feeds back to inhibit the inputs to other elements. The action of this presynaptic inhibition is nonlinear with a possible biophysical substrate. This paper shows that the new network converges stably to a solution that both relays the winner's identity and amplitude and suppresses information on the losers with arbitrary precision. We prove these results mathematically and illustrate the effectiveness of the network and some of its variants by computer simulations."

Given the positions of N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

In this paper, a simple neuronal wiring diagram is proposed that can reproduce both simple and higher-order behavioral paradigms seen in invertebrate classical conditioning experiments. Learning in this model does not take place by modification of synaptic strength values. Instead, the model uses a layer of interneurons with modifiable thresholds for spike initiation, as suggested by the plasticity mechanisms thought to operate in Hermissenda [Alkon, D. L. (1983) Sci. Am. 249, 70-84]. The model therefore has an advantage in plausibility compared with more standard models using Hebb synapses or their functional equivalents, which have not yet been demonstrated in any invertebrate organism."

The elastic net approach jointly minimizes the length of an arbitrary path in the plane and the distance between the path points and the cities. The tradeoff between these two requirements is controlled by a scale parameter K. A global minimum is found for large K, and is then tracked to a small value. In this paper, we show that (1) in the small K limit the elastic path passes arbitrarily close to all the cities, but that only one path point is attracted to each city, (2) in the large K limit the net lies at the center of the set of cities, and (3) at a critical value of K the energy function bifurcates. We also show that this method can be interpreted in terms of extremizing a probability distribution controlled by K. The minimum at a given K corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimate of the tour under a natural statistical interpretation.

We describe a \"parts\" representation that is fairly general purpose, despite having only a small number of parameters. Having this expressive power captured by a small number of parameters allows us to approach the problem of recovering an object's part structure by use of minimal length encoding. We present several examples of recovering part structure using various types of range imagery to show that the recovery procedure is robust."

The purpose of this paper is to point out that for certain ranges of parameter values, the algorithm converges into local minima that do not correspond to valid tours. The key parameter is the ratio governing the relative strengths of the two competing terms in the elastic net energy function. Based on recent work by Durbin, Szeliski and Yuille, the parameter regime in which the net may visit some cities twice is examined. Further analysis predicts the regime in which the net may fail to visit some cities at all. Understanding these limitations allows one to select the parameter value most likely to avoid either type of problem. Simulation data support the theoretical work."

They provide an attractive means of investigating striate cortex, where important response properties are organized in two dimensions. In the present study, patterns of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity were obtained repeatedly from the same patch of cortex using the dye merocyanine oxazolone, together with current image-processing techniques. The patterns observed agree with most established features of monkey striate cortex and suggest a new unit of cortical organization; one that is modular in structure and which appears to link the organization of orientation selectivity with that of ocular dominance."

It corresponds to the best match of a structure {y,} with a priori constraints (minimal squared length) to the set of cities {x,}.

However, many of the results for long-range motion can be directly adapted to stereo. In his seminal work Ullman (1979) formulated long-range motion as a correspondence problem between features in adjacent image time frames and proposed a minimal mapping theory, which could account for a number of psychophysical experiments."

Moreover, this effective energy was shown to be closely related (and exactly equivalent for some parameter values) to that used by Blake (1983, 1989) in his weak constraint approach to image segmentation. Eliminating the I field in this way can be thought of (Wyatt, private communication) as computing the marginal probability distribution pm( f ) = CE p(f, I ) , where p ( f , 1 ) is defined by the Gibbs distribution p(f, I ) = e-aEcf,E)/Z with Z a normalization constant (the partition function). This yields p,( f = e-fiEeff/Zeff, where Zeff is a normalization constant. It was then realized that using the partition function gave another important advantage since global constraints over the set of possible fields could be enforced during the evaluation of the partition function. This was emphasized by Geiger and Yuille (1989) in their analysis of the winner-take-all problem, discussed in detail in the next section. The constraint that there is only one winner can be imposed either by (1) adding a term in the energy function to bias toward final states with a single winner, or (2) evaluating the partition function for the system by evaluating it only over configurations with a single winner. For this problem method (2) is definitely prefFrable since it leads directly to a formula for the minimum variance estimators. On the other hand, (1) only leads to an algorithm that might converge to the minimum variance estimators, but that might also get trapped in a local minimum. This suggested that it was preferable to impose global constraints while evaluating the partition function since the alternative led to unnecessary local minima and increased computation. This conclusion was reinforced by applications to the correspondence problem in stereo (Yuille et ul. 1989a) and long-range motion (see Section 3). Both these problems can be posed as matching problems with some prior expectations on the outcome. Further support for the importance of imposing global constraints in this manner came from work on the traveling salesman problem (TSP). It has long been suspected that the greater empirical success (Wilson and Pawley 1988; Peterson 1990) of the elastic net algorithm (Durbin and Willshaw 1987; Durbin et al. 1989) compared to the original Hopfield and Tank (1985) algorithm was due to the way the elastic net imposed its constraints."
