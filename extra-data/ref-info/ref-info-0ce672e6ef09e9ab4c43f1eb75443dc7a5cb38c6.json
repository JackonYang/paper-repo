A central cue directed the subjects\u2019 attention to either a right or a left spatial location where a detection task was performed. The cue was either a high/low or neutral-validity indicator of the position in which an event was likely to occur. A rating-scale response scheme in conjunction with the subjects\u2019 target signal locational judgments allowed for the construction of ROC curves for each condition. Significant benefits were found for all subjects, supporting the hypothesis that selective attention can enhance perceptual sensitivity. Deallocation of attention resulted in an inhibition of sensitivity in unattended spatial locations. Subjects were consistently most sensitive in the right spatial location. There were no significant differences in overall response bias among the three conditions or in spatial locations. The results support theories of attention, such as \u201cperceptual tuning, \u201d that suggest very early selective control."

                "text": "that area 7 of posterior parietal cortex plays a role in visual attention and eye movements. We have operationally defined attention as a stimulus-selection process independent of the specific movement used to respond to the stimulus. We trained monkeys to make various hand or eye movements and recorded from single neurons in area 7 while the monkeys were performing these tasks. 2. As demonstrated previously ( 19, 20, 46, 47, 63), many cells in area 7 respond to visual stimuli independent of any behavior. The discharge to a stimulus may be enhanced when the animal makes an eye movement to the stimulus. 3. We used two paradigms to study the modulation of visual responses when the animal used a stimulus without making an eye movement. The first was a peripheral-attention task in which the animal had to signal the occurrence of a peripheral stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Half of the cells studied gave an enhanced response in this task. In the second task, the animal had to reach out and touch a stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Visually responsive parietal neurons also yielded enhanced responses in this task. 4. The enhancements demonstrable in the saccade, peripheral-attention, and handreach tasks probably represent the same underlying process because their frequency of occurrence in our sample is almost identical, the intensities are quite similar, and cells that give an enhanced response on one task give an enhanced response in the others. 5. These results show that in posterior parietal cortex, the behavioral enhancement of a visual response is independent of the specific movement used to respond to the stimulus. The physiological mechanism of enhancement, which is movement independent and spatially selective, resembles the psychological phenomenon of selective spatial attention. We suggest that the role of area 7 in visual attention may be mediated by the enhancement of visual responses to selected stimuli."

Treisman and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions, subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups, each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration."

The shift of attention appears to take place within 50 msec following a cue indicating the most likely position of the target. The present study reports that these shifts of attention can be time locked to a central cue. Moreover, they show that a probe event located between the cue and the target receives maximal facilitation from attention at a time prior to maximal facilitation at the target.

                "text": "In the Color Vision Symposium at the Academy in April 1958, we showed a series of experiments which demonstrated that \"4whereas in color-mixing theory the wavelengths of the stimuli and the energy content at each wavelength are significant in determining the sense of color . . . in images neither the wavelength of the stimulus nor the energy at each wavelength determines the color. This departure from what we expect on the basis of colorimetry is not a small effect, but is complete . .. .' (1, 2). The initial and most engaging experiment comprised taking two black-and-white photographs of the same scene, one through a red filter and one through a green filter, and projecting these two black-and-white pictures in superposition on the screen to yield a single black-and-white panchromatic image of the scene. When a red filter was placed in the path of the light from the projector that contained the picture taken through a red filter, the whole scene became dramatically colored as if in many respects it were a standard full-color photograph. The first paradox was that the radiation coming to the eye of the observer consisted only of various ratios of red light to white light which should have yielded only a variety of pinks. The second paradox was that the overall ratio of light from the one projector to light from the other projector could be changed markedly without changing the color names of the objects in the colored picture: the colors of the individual objects must be determined by the ratio of red light to white light, but a change in the overall ratio of red light to white light did not change the colors. In light of the understanding which we now have, this simple experiment, which was a shock to the intuitive understanding of all of us, turns out to be the most sophisticated experiment we could have undertaken. For the flavor of the many experiments described at the Symposium, I refer you to the two papers (1, 2) at that time. Here, I want to turn to the quantitative procedures which we now use. We prepared a laboratory display which we dubbed a \"Mondrian\" (although it actually is closer to a van Doesburg), utilizing about 100 colored papers. A paper of a given color would appear many times in different parts of the display, each time having a different size and shape and each time being surrounded by a different set of other colored papers. One reason for the design was to prohibit the superposition of afterimages of areas onto other areas (3), and another reason for the design was to obviate explanations of results in terms of the size or shape or surrounding of any given paper. The Mondrian is illuminated by using three 35-mm slide projectors with no slides in the slide holder. The output of each projector/illuminator is controlled independently. An interference filter passing long waves is placed in the path of one projector, a middle wave filter, in the path of the second, and a short-wave filter, in the path of the third (Fig. 1). One may think of these as relating roughly to the three visual pigments. A telescopic photometer (Spectra Pritchard photometer, model 1980A), placed roughly where the observers will be, receives and measures radiation from about 1/16th of a square inch on each chosen area of the Mondrian when it is pointed at that area. The instrument is calibrated so that at any wavelength it reports directly in watts per steradian per square meter. Let me call your attention to these four papers: yellow, white, green, and blue. The telescope is pointed at a yellow paper. The short-wave and middle-wave illuminators are turned off, and the whole Mondrian is illuminated with the long-wave illuminator. The output of this projector is then changed until the meter reads exactly \"one\" (0.1 W per Sr2 per m2). The longwave illuminator is turned off and the middle-wave illuminator is turned on. Its output is adjusted until the meter reads one. This ensures that the amount of middle-wave energy now reaching the meter from that small patch is equal to the amount of long-wave energy. Finally, after the middle-wave illuminator is turned off, the short-wave illuminator is turned on, and its output is set so that the meter (which we must remember is reading the radiation to our eyes) reads one. All three illuminators are now turned on. While looking at the Mondrian as a whole, we note that the yellow paper looks yellow. We now turn our attention to the white paper, pointing the telephotometer at it. We go through the same procedure of illuminating with one illuminator at a time and of setting each illuminator so that the light coming this time from the white paper to the meter, and hence to our eyes, measures one for the long wave and one for the middle wave and one for the short wave. Thus, we have arranged to have coming to our eye from the piece of white paper exactly the same flux-the same wavelength composition, the same energy composition-which a moment earlier we had arranged to have coming to our eye from the piece of yellow paper. The somewhat indigestible question is \"what color will the piece of paper be which was white in the Mondrian previously?\" Keep in mind that the information now coming to our eye from that piece of paper dictates classically that, if one, one, and one coming to our eye gave yellow, then one, one, and one must again be yellow. This conviction dates back to Newton's proposition V (4):"

We have studied the time course and the effects of mid-brain and cortical damage on these components of orienting. The facilitation arises from shifts in covert attention. In cases of mid-brain degeneration due to progressive supranuclear palsy, saccadic movements were abolished, while covert orienting still occurs. However, covert orienting was found to be delayed in directions in which eye movements were most affected, suggesting a role for mid-brain pathways in covert orienting. Parietal lesions can cause massive loss in detection contralateral to the lesion. This is especially true when attention has been directed to the opposite side. These findings relate aspects of covert orienting of attention to neural control systems."

Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system."

Identification reaction times increased on the order of 100 msec as targets were located 3 deg from the fovea center, and results under convergent operations in the design suggested that these reaction time increases were a manifestation of peripheral stimulus degradation factors (such as acuity, masking, and luminance) rather than more central cognitive processes."

Other kinds of evidence should, however, give us pause. Why is it proving so difficult to programme scene analysis? What do we make of physiological and anatomical discoveries suggesting the existence of specialized feature detectors and even of spatially segregated areas of the brain responding selectively to different dimensions such as colour, orientation, stereoscopic depth, and movement [1]? The immediacy and directness of conscious experience are no guarantee that it reflects an early stage of information-processing in the nervous system."

These features, called \u201ctextons\u201d, are elongated blobs (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, or line segments) with specific properties, including color, angular orientation, width, length, binocular and movement disparity, and flicker rate. The ends-of-lines (terminators) and crossings of line segments are also textons. Only differences in the textons or in their density (or number) can be preattentively detected while the positional relationship between neighboring textons passes unnoticed. This kind of positional information is the essence of form perception, and can be extracted only by a time-consuming and spatially restricted process that we call \u201cfocal attention\u201d. The aperture of focal attention can be very narrow, even restricted to a minute portion of the fovea, and shifting its locus requires about 50 ms. Thus preattentive vision serves as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d by pointing out those loci of texton differences that should be attended to. According to this theory, at any given instant the visual information intake is relatively modest."

It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence mnuch of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."

A central arrow cued the most likely target location. The direction of attention was inferred from reaction times to expected, unexpected, and neutral locations. The development of a spatial attentional set with time was examined by presenting target probes at varying times after the cue. There were no effects of distance on the time course of the attentional set. Reaction times for far locations were slower than for near, but the effects of attention were evident by 150 msec in both cases. Spatial attention does not shift with a characteristic, fixed velocity. Rather, velocity is proportional to distance, resulting in a movement time that is invariant over the distances tested."

This colour constancy can be explained by the retinex theory, which predicts the colour of a point on any object from a computed relationship between the radiation from that point and the radiation from all the other points in the field of view (Fig. 1). Thus the computations for colour perception occur across large distances in the visual field. It has not been clear, however, whether these long-range interactions take place in the retina or the cortex. Reports that long-range colour interactions can be reproduced binocularly when one band of wavelengths enters one eye and a different band enters the other2 might seem to establish the cortex as the site of the computation. Many observers, however, see very unsatisfactory colour or no colour at all in this binocular situation, suggesting that the cortex may not be the only site at which the computation is carried out, or even the most important site. We have now tested the role of the cortex in a human subject in whom the nerve fibres connecting cortical areas subserving two separate parts of the visual field had been severed, and find that the cortex is necessary for long-range colour computations."

                "text": "The main factors limiting the performance of the peripheral parts of the visual system can be specified, and doing this clarifies the nature of the interpretive tasks that must be performed by the central parts of the system. It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence much of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation ; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

The responses of parietal LS neurons to visual stimuli are facilitated during the state of attentive fixation of a target light as compared to their responses to physically and retinotopically identical test stimuli delivered during the eye pauses of alert wakefulness. Seventy percent of the neurons tested (n = 55) showed significant increments in responses in the state of attentive fixation; the median value of the increments was 3.5 times. Only 4 of the 55 cells examined completely showed the reverse relation. Three sets of control experiments were done. The facilitation occurred when the responses evoked during the trials of a reaction task with attentive fixation of a target were compared with those evoked by identical stimuli delivered to the same retinotopic locations at the end of each intertrial interval: the facilitation of attentive fixation is not due to a shift in the general level of arousal. The facilitation occurred when the animal maintained attentive fixation of a spot of the tangent screen without a target light or when an additional light mimicking the target light was presented along with testing stimuli in the state of alert wakefulness without attentive fixation: the facilitation is not produced by a sensory-sensory interaction between target and testing lights. Finally, the facilitation was observed whether or not the test stimuli were behaviorally relevant. We conclude that the act of attentive fixation exerts a specific and powerful effect upon the excitability of the neural systems linking the retinae and the inferior parietal lobule and that the facilitation plays an important role in visually guided behavior."

This paper explores one aspect of cognition through the use of a simple model task in which human subjects are asked to commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation. This instruction is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field in terms of momentary changes in the efficiency of detecting stimuli. A comparison of results obtained with alert monkeys, brain injured and normal human subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. In accordance with Bartlett's insight, the possibility is explored that similar principles apply to orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures used in thinking."

Labelled cells occurred in all layers of the l. g. n., distributed in a roughly columnar fashion. The large scatter in cell distribution indicated a lower retinotopic precision for this projection than for the one to area 17. Labelled cells are of a medium to large size and, in each section, a few were located near the laminar border or in interlaminar zones. The functional significance of this projection is discussed."

The targets were preceded by a cue, and the time interval between the cue and the target (stimulus-onset asynchrony; SOA) was varied. For each peripheral distance, the reaction time function initially declined as SOA was increased and then reached asymptote. The further the target from fixation, the longer the SOA at which the function reached asymptote. The asymptotic SOA values were taken as a measure of the time it takes attention to reach a given target. Comparisons of these values for the three peripheral distances permitted estimating the velocity of attention movements. These measurements suggest that when summoned by a peripheral cue, attention travels through space at a constant velocity of about 1 degree per 8 msec. Language: en"

Automatic processing is activation of a learned sequence of elements in long-term memory that is initiated by appropriate inputs and then proceeds automatically\u2014without subject control, without stressing the capacity limitations of the system, and without necessarily demanding attention. Controlled processing is a temporary activation of a sequence of elements that can be set up quickly and easily but requires attention, is capacity-limited (usually serial in nature), and is controlled by the subject. A series of studies using both reaction time and accuracy measures is presented, which traces these concepts in the form of automatic detection and controlled, search through the areas of detection, search, and attention. Results in these areas are shown to arise from common mechanisms. Automatic detection is shown to develop following consistent mapping of stimuli to responses over trials. Controlled search is utilized in varied-mapping paradigms, and in our studies, it takes the form of serial, terminating search. The approach resolves a number of apparent conflicts in the literature."

In contrast, adjacent sections stained with the Fink\u2010Heimer method showed fine dust like degeneration throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus.

When you get an idea and want to remember it, you create a K-line for it. When later activated, the K-line induces a partial mental state resembling the one that created it. A partial mental state is a subset of those mental agencies operating at one moment. This view leads to many ideas about the development, structure and physiology of memory, and about how to implement framelike representations in a distributed processor."

The results showed that changes in shape or orientation which leave the component lines of the figures vertical and horizontal do not facilitate grouping as readily as changes which alter the direction of the component lines to 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0. These results corroborate and extend the findings of Beck (l966a, 1966b) and are discussed in relation to the problem of specifying the properties of line figures that produce grouping by similarity."
