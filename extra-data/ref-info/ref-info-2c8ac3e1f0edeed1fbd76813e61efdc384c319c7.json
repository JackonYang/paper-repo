A unified learning approach is used to develop a part-of-speech tagger, a shallow parser, a named entity recognizer and a module for identifying a question's target. These components are used in analyzing questions, as well as in the analysis of selected passages that may contain the sought after answer. The performance of the learned modules seems to be very high, (e.g., mid 90% for identifying noun phrases in sentences), though evaluating those on a large number of passages proved to be time consuming. Other components of the system, a passage retrieval module and an answer selection module, were put together in an ad-hoc fashion and significantly affected the overall performance. We ran the system only over about 60% of questions, answering a third of them correctly."

We carry out three types of analysis: inherent properties of the data, feature analysis, and performance bounds. Based on these analyses we explain some of the performance results of the current generation of Q/A systems and make predictions on future work. In particular, we present four findings: (1) Q/A system performance is correlated with answer repetition; (2) relative overlap scores are more effective than absolute overlap scores; (3) equivalence classes on scoring functions can be used to quantify performance bounds; and (4) perfect answer typing still leaves a great deal of ambiguity for a Q/A system because sentences often contain several items of the same type."

Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem.We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes.In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably to the best."

The first is a Markovian approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We develop efficient combination algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing."

These tasks, however, are not handled well by general purpose learning methods and are usually addressed in an ad-hoc fashion. We suggest a general approach -- a sequential learning model that utilizes classifiers to sequentially restrict the number of competing classes while maintaining, with high probability, the presence of the true outcome in the candidates set. Some theoretical and computational properties of the model are discussed and we argue that these are important in NLP-like domains. The advantages of the model are illustrated in an experiment in part-of-speech tagging."

In this work we set out to evaluate whether this direction is worthwhile by comparing a learned shallow parser to one of the best learned full parsers on tasks both can perform --- identifying phrases in sentences. We conclude that directly learning to perform these tasks as shallow parsers do is advantageous over full parsers both in terms of performance and robustness to new and lower quality texts."

Two characteristic properties of such problems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their target concepts depend on only a small subset of the features in the space. Under such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow have been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. In the work reported here, we present an algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and apply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. We evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a statistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We find: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves accuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the pruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the literature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) While several aspects of WinSpell's architecture contribute to its superiority over BaySpell, the primary factor is that it is able to learn a better linear separator than BaySpell learns; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the training set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt, using a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set."

Mammone Dept. of Ele tri al Engineering, Rutgers University, Pis ataway, NJ 08854 mammone aip.rutgers.edu Abstra t We des ribe the IBM Statisti al Question Answering for TREC-9 system in detail and look at several examples and errors. The system is an appli ation of maximum entropy lassi ation for question/answer type predi tion and named entity marking. We des ribe our system for information retrieval whi h in the rst step did do ument retrieval from a lo al en y lopedia, and in the se ond step performed an expansion of the query words and nally did passage retrieval from the TREC olle tion. We will also dis uss the answer sele tion algorithm whi h determines the best senten e given both the question and the o urren e of a phrase belonging to the answer lass desired by the question. Results at the 250 byte and 50 byte levels for the overall system as well as results on ea h sub omponent are presented. 1 System Des ription Systems that perform question answering automati ally by omputer have been around for some time as des ribed by (Green et al., 1963). Only re ently though have systems been developed to handle huge databases and a slightly ri her set of questions. The types of questions that an be dealt with today are restri ted to be short answer fa t based questions. In TREC-8, a number of sites parti ipated in the rst question-answering evaluation (Voorhees and Ti e, 1999) and the best systems identi ed four major subomponents: Question/Answer Type Classi ation Query expansion/Information Retrieval Named Entity Marking Answer Sele tion Our system ar hite ture for this year was built around these four major omponents as shown in Fig. 1. Here, the question is input and lassi ed as asking for an answer whose ategory is one of the named entity lasses to be des ribed below. Additionally, the question is presented to the information retrieval (IR) engine for query expansion and do ument retrieval. This engine, given the query, looks at the database of do uments and outputs the best do uments or passages annotated with the named entities. The nal stage is to sele t the exa t answer, given the information about the answer lass and the top s oring passages. Minimizing various distan e metri s applied over phrases or windows of text results in the best s oring se tion that has a phrase belonging to answer lass. This then represents the best s oring answer."

For example, the previous sentence breaks up something like this: \n \n(1) \n \n[I begin] [with an intuition]: [when I read] [a sentence], [I read it] [a chunk] [at a time] \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese chunks correspond in some way to prosodic patterns. It appears, for instance, that the strongest stresses in the sentence fall one to a chunk, and pauses are most likely to fall between chunks. Chunks also represent a grammatical watershed of sorts. The typical chunk consists of a single content word surrounded by a constellation of function words, matching a fixed template. A simple context-free grammar is quite adequate to describe the structure of chunks. By contrast, the relationships between chunks are mediated more by lexical selection than by rigid templates. Co-occurrence of chunks is determined not just by their syntactic categories, but is sensitive to the precise words that head them; and the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks."

These definitions might be quite complex and, inevitably, might require the use of quantified expressions. Attempts to use first order languages for these purposes are hampered by the fact that relational inference is intractable and, consequently, so is the problem of learning relational definitions. This work develops an expressive relational representation language that allows the use of propositional learning algorithms when learning relational definitions. The representation serves as an intermediate level between a raw description of observations in the world and a propositional learning system that attempts to learn definitions for concepts and relations. It allows for hierarchical composition of relational expressions that can be evaluated efficiently on the observations and thus supports learning complex definitions by learning simple functions of the intermediate representations. The approach is illustrated using examples from natural language and visual processing."
