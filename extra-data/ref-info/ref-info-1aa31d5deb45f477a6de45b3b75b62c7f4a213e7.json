Knowledge is represented in the Hearsay- 1 system as procedures and in the Dragon system as a Markov network with a- priori transition probabilities between states. Systematic performance analysis of various design choices of these two systems resulted in the HARPY system, in which knowledge is represented as a finite state transition network but without the a-priori transition probabilities. Harpy searches only a few 'best' syntactic (and acoustic) paths in parallel to determine the optimal path, and uses segmentation to effectively reduce the utterance length, thereby reducing the number of state probability updates that must be done. Several new heuristics have been added to the HARPY system to improve its performance and speed: detection of common sub-nets and collapsing them to reduce overall network size and complexity, eliminating the need for doing an acoustic match for all phonemic types at every time sample, and semi-automatic techniques for learning the lexical representations (that are needed for a steady-state system of this type) and the phonemic templates from training data, thus automatically accounting for the commonly occurring intra-word coarticulation and juncture phenomena. Inter-word phenomena are handled by the use of juncture rules which are applied at network generation time, thereby eliminating the need for repetitive and time consuming application of phonological rules during the recognition phase."

Providing these samples to the system can be a long and tedious process for users. One way to attack this problem is to make use of extra information from a data bank representing a large population of speakers. In this paper we demonstrate that by using Bayesian techniques, prior knowledge derived from speaker-independent data can be combined with speaker-dependent training data to improve system performance."

                "text": "In this paper, we describe efforts to improve the performance of FEATURE, the Carnegie-Mellon University speaker-independent speech recognition system that classifies isolated letters of the English alphabet by enabling the system to learn the acoustical characteristics of individual speakers. Even when features are designed to be speaker-independent, it is frequently observed that feature values may vary more from speaker to speaker for a single letter than they vary from letter to letter. In these cases, it is necessary to adjust the system's statistical description of the features of individual speakers to obtain improved recognition performance. This paper describes a set of dynamic adaptation procedures for updating expected feature values during recognition. The algorithm uses maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation techniques to update the mean vectors of sets of feature values on a speaker-by-speaker basis. The MAP estimation algorithm makes use of both knowledge of the observations input to the system from an individual speaker and the relative variability of the features' means within and across all speakers. In addition, knowledge of the covariance of the features' mean vectors across the various letters enables the system to adapt its representation of similar-sounding letters after any one of them is presented to the classifier. The use of dynamic speaker adaptation improves classification performance of FEATURE by 49 percent after four presentations of the alphabet, when the system is provided with supervised training indicating which specific utterance had been presented to the classifier from a particular user. Performance can be improved by as much as 31 percent when the system is allowed to adapt passively in an unsupervised learning mode. without any information from individual users."

Recently, attention has been focused on the application of these models to talker-independent, isolated-word recognition. Initial results using models with discrete output densities for isolated-digit recognition were later improved using models based on continuous output densities. In a series of experiments on isolated-word recognition, we applied hidden Markov models with multivariate Gaussian output densities to the problem. Speech data was represented by feature vectors consisting of eight log area ratios and the log LPC error. A weak measure of vocal-tract dynamics was included in the observations by appending to the feature vector observed at time t, the vector observed at time t-\u03b4, for some fixed offset \u03b4. The best models were obtained with offsets of 75 or 90 msecs. When a comparison is made on a common data base, the resulting error rate of 0.2% for isolated-digit recognition improves on previous algorithms."

In many vocabularies, each word has a highly distinctive sequence. Some vocabularies have confusable words with very similar sequences, leading to poor recognition performance. Improvements in discriminability among similar words may be achieved by altering the matching algorithm, or by improving the reference template set. Both techniques are instances of multi-exemplar learning techniques which improve recognition performance through automatic evaluation of training data. This paper examines several such techniques using isolated utterances and highly ambiguous vocabularies (e.g., the \"E\" set; 3 B C D E G P V T Z) in a speaker-dependent recognition system. A system which combined both featural and template information led to the best performance for six out of eight speakers. Using this technique, E-set error rates improved from 37% to 10%."

The total log prediction residual of an input signal is minimized by optimally registering the reference LPC onto the input autocorrelation coefficients using the dynamic programming algorithm (DP). The input signal is recognized as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction residual. A sequential decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in DP. A frequency normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections. The system has been implemented on a DDP-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment.

We have previously described how the system uses MAP techniques to update its estimates of the mean values of features used by the classifier in recognizing the letters of the English alphabet on the basis of a priori information and labelled observations. In the first of the new procedures described in this paper the system assumes a correct decision every time it classifies a new utterance with a sufficiently high confidence level. In the second new procedure the system adjusts its estimates of the means on the basis of their correlation with the average values of the features over all utterances. Experiments were conducted on two confusable sets of letters using both speaker adaptation procedures. In each case classification performance using the unsupervised estimation procedures could equal that obtained using speaker adaptation with feedback from the user, although which method provided the better performance depended on which set of letters was being classified."

The algorithm, based on maximum a posteriori probability estimation techniques, uses the labelled observations input thus far to the classifier, as well as the a priori correlations of the features within and across the various letters or sets of letters (classes). The probability density functions (pdf) of all the classes are updated simultaneously rather than on a class-by-class basis so that the pdf of a given class is updated before any observation from that class has been input. A significant improvement in the recognition performance was observed for different vocabularies as the system tuned to the the characteristics of a new speaker. Finally, the algorithm was compared to simpler forms of dynamic adaptation. It produced a faster decrease of the error rate than the other tuning procedures. After a small number of iterations, however, the various procedures yielded similar results."

The enrollment period for a new user is approximately 20 minutes. The basic vocabulary is chosen from the most common words in several collections of documents such as office memoranda and business letters. The system supports spelling and interactive personalization to augment this vocabulary. Signal processing, vector quantization, and acoustic matching algorithms are programmed on the IBM Signal Processors which fit into the PC AT chassis. The PC AT controls the Processors and implements the decoder stack search and the language model, as well as the application-specific interface. The modular architecture of the design is expandable to a 20,000-word vocabulary system by the addition of two more IBM Signal Processors housed in a PC Expansion Unit."

They are: 1) the choice of a warping algorithm among the Itakura asymmetric, the Sakoe and Chiba symmetric, and the Sakoe and Chiba asymmetric, and 2) the size of the warping window to reduce computation time. Two vocabularies were used: the digits (zero, one,..., nine) and a highly confusable subset of the alphabet (b, c, d, e, g, p, t, v, z). The Itakura asymmetric warping algorithm appears to be slightly better than the other two for the confusable vocabulary. We discuss the reasons why the performance of the algorithms is vocabulary dependent. Finally, for the data used in our experiments, a warping window of about 100 ms appears to be optimal."

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given."

                "text": "One of the major drawbacks of the standard pattern recognition approach to isolated word recognition is that poor performance is generally achieved for word vocabularies with acoustically similar words. This poor performance is related to the pattern similarity (distance) algorithms that are generally used in which a global distance between the test pattern and each reference pattern is computed. Since acoustically similar words are, by definition, globally similar, it is difficult to reliably discriminate such words, and a high error rate is obtained. By modifying the pattern similarity algorithm so that the recognition decision is made in two passes, improvements in discriminability among similar words can be achieved. In particular, on the first pass the recognizer provides a set of global distance scores which are used to decide a class (or a set of possible classes) in which the spoken word is estimated to belong. On the second pass a locally weighted distance is used to provide optimal separation among words in the chosen class (or classes) and the recognition decision is made on the basis of these local distance scores. For a highly complex vocabulary (letters of the alphabet, digits, and 3 command words) recognition improvements of from 3 to 7 percent were obtained using the two-pass recognition strategy."

This segmenter is presented in sufficient detail for duplication by others, not only for speech segmentation but also for alternate applications of a similar nature. Performance data are given for a large amount ( 8\\frac{1}{2} min) of continuous speech, for a currently running version of the speech segmentation GLODIS.

It is easy to apply in many problems and is stable but slow. The algorithm fails to provide a consistent estimator of the standard errors of the maximum likelihood estimates unless the additional analysis required by the Louis method is performed. Newton-type or other gradient methods are faster and provide error estimates but tend to be unstable and require the analytical evaluation of likelihoods to derive expressions for the score function and (at least) approximations to the Fisher information matrix. The purpose of this paper is to expand on a result by Fisher that permits a unification of EM methodology and Newton methods. The evaluation of the individual observation-by-observation score functions of the incomplete data is a byproduct of the application of the E step of the EM algorithm. Once these become available, the Fisher information matrix may be consistently estimated, and the M step may be replaced by a fast Newton-type step."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."

The approach taken is to use a computer procedure to obtain the \u201cbest\u201d partition of n objects into g groups. A number of mathematical criteria for \u201cbest\u201d are discussed and related to statistical theory. A procedure for optimizing the criteria is outlined.
