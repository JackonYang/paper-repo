Let $P_n := n^{-1}(\\delta_{X_1} + \\cdots + \\delta_{X_n})$ be the empirical measure and let $\\nu_n := n^\\frac{1}{2}(P_n - P)$. Given a class $\\mathscr{C} \\subset \\mathscr{a}$, we study the convergence in law of $\\nu_n$, as a stochastic process indexed by $\\mathscr{C}$, to a certain Gaussian process indexed by $\\mathscr{C}$. If convergence holds with respect to the supremum norm $\\sup_{C \\in \\mathscr{C}}|f(C)|$, in a suitable (usually nonseparable) function space, we call $\\mathscr{C}$ a Donsker class. For measurability, $X$ may be a complete separable metric space, $\\mathscr{a} =$ Borel sets, and $\\mathscr{C}$ a suitable collection of closed sets or open sets. Then for the Donsker property it suffices that for some $m$, and every set $F \\subset X$ with $m$ elements, $\\mathscr{C}$ does not cut all subsets of $F$ (Vapnik-Cervonenkis classes). Another sufficient condition is based on metric entropy with inclusion. If $\\mathscr{C}$ is a sequence $\\{C_m\\}$ independent for $P$, then $\\mathscr{C}$ is a Donsker class if and only if for some $r, \\sigma_m(P(C_m)(1 - P(C_m)))^r < \\infty$."

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces."
