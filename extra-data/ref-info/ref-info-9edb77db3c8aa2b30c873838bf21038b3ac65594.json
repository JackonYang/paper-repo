Searching for documents by their type is a natural way to enhance the effectiveness of document retrieval in the workplace [2], and a such system is proposed in [4]. The goal of our work is to build classifiers that can determine the type or genre of a document image. We use primarily layout features since the layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to identify a document\u2019s type. Layout analysis is necessary since our input image has no structural definition that is immediately perceivable by a computer. Classification is thus based on \u201cvisual similarity\u201d of the structure without reference to models of particular kinds of pages. There has been some classification work reported but most require either domain specific models [3, 5, 6, 8] or are based on text obtained by optical character recognition (OCR) [3, 6, 8]."

By analyzing a document\u2019s layout and conceptual structures, we present in this paper a sample-based approach to document classification. We represent a document\u2019s layout structure by an ordered labeled tree through a procedure known as nested segmentation and represent the document\u2019s conceptual structure by a set of attribute type pairs. The layout similarities between the document to be classified and sample documents are determined by a previously developed approximate tree matching toolkit. The conceptual similarities between the documents are determined by analyzing their contents and by calculating the degree of conceptual closeness. The document type is identified by computing both the layout and conceptual similarities between the document to be classified and the samples in the document sample base. Some experimental results are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."

It is the author's job to design the document so that the information it contains can be interpreted accurately and eeciently. To do this, the author can make use of a set of stylistic tools. In this paper we introduce the concept of document functionality, which attempts to describe the roles of documents and their components in the process of transferring information. A functional description of a document provides insight into the type of the document, into its intended uses, and into strategies for automatic document interpretation and retrieval. To demonstrate these ideas, we deene a taxonomy of functional document components and show how functional descriptions can be used to reverse-engineer the intentions of the author, to navigate in document space, and to provide important contextual information to aid in interpretation. Written documents have long been the preferred medium for the transfer of information across both time and space. In this sense, the general purpose or \\function\" of a document is to store data produced by a sender in a symbolic form to facilitate transfer to a receiver. Traditionally, the data takes the form of a set of markings on a page, with the sender corresponding to the \\author\", and the receiver to the \\reader\". In this paper we limit ourselves to the understanding and interpretation of these \\traditional\" 2D documents which the reader receives visually. We do not consider 3D artifacts that might be used to transfer information (not even cases such as Braille, bas-relief, etc., which are nearly 2D), nor do we treat time-varying \\documents\" such as audio or video, though it seems clear to us that our approach could be extended to such non-traditional domains. When documents are regarded as message conveyers, we can classify them according to the type of message that is conveyed. We will diierentiate between three classes: informa-tional, instructional, and identiicational. Informational: The message can contain \\expository\" information such as might be found in a report, dictionary, newspaper, novel, catalogue or the like. Instructional: The message may have an instructional content, relating to an action or series of actions, such as found in a recipe book, a do-it-yourself manual, a how-to-get-there description, a road sign, etc. A special case of this category, which we shall refer to as the \\dialogue\" sub-category, involves instructions about changing \u2026"

The IDIR system will provide close connections with and utilization of document analysis and image processing techniques, advanced computing and networking, and modern approaches to database management. The system design consists of aggressively modularized components to enhance the development of individual parts which are used in the complete solution, including: Interface speciications, multipurpose feature extraction, an integrated eecient query language, physical retrieval from an object-oriented database, and delivery of retrieved objects. In this paper, we introduce the general framework, feature extraction modules, query capabilities, a graphical query interface, and the application interface. We demonstrate each component of the system and how the query mechanisms can be used to handle both content and structural queries eeectively."

Such trees have many applications in vision, pattern recognition, molecular biology, programming compilation, and natural language processing. Many of the applications involve comparing trees or retrieving/extracting information from a repository of trees. Examples include classification of unknown patterns, analysis of newly sequenced RNA structures, semantic taxonomy for dictionary definitions, generation of interpreters for nonprocedural programming languages, and automatic error recovery and correction for programming languages. Previous systems use exact matching (or generalized regular expression matching) for tree comparison. This paper presents a system, called approximate-tree-by-example (ATBE), which allows inexact matching of trees. The ATBE system interacts with the user through a simple but powerful query language; graphical devices are provided to facilitate inputing the queries. The paper describes the architecture of ATBE, illustrates its use and describes some aspects of ATBE implementation. We also discuss the underlying algorithms and provide some sample applications. >"

In this paper the derivation of \u201cClassic\u201d MaxEnt is completed, showing that it leads to a natural choice for the regularising parameter \u03b1, that supersedes the traditional practice of setting x2=N. The new condition is that the dimensionless measure of structure -2\u03b1S should be equal to the number of good singular values contained in the data. The performance of this new condition is discussed with reference to image deconvolution, but leads to a reconstruction that is visually disappointing. A deeper hypothesis space is proposed that overcomes these difficulties, by allowing for spatial correlations across the image."

It may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics, medical imaging and motion capture inducstries. Although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research, limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints. This work conquers this problem by changing the Riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints. The computational algorithms are based on Ricci flow and nonlinear heat diffusion methods. The approach is general and robust. We employ our algorithm to study the constrained surface registration problem which applies to both computer vision and medical imaging applications. Experimental results demonstrate that, by changing the Riemannian metric, the registrations are always diffeomorphic and achieve relatively high performance when evaluated with some popular surface registration evaluation standards."

This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees."
