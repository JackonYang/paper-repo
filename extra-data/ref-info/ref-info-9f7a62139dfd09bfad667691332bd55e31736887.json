Existing approaches for table detection mainly focus on detecting tables in single columns of text and do not work reliably on documents with varying layouts. This paper presents a practical algorithm for table detection that works with a high accuracy on documents with varying layouts (company reports, newspaper articles, magazine pages, ...). An open source implementation of the algorithm is provided as part of the Tesseract OCR engine. Evaluation of the algorithm on document images from publicly available UNLV dataset shows competitive performance in comparison to the table detection module of a commercial OCR system."

Today, quite a large number of different approaches facing these tasks have been described in literature or are available as part of commercial OCR systems that claim to deal with tables on the scanned documents and to treat them accordingly.\n However, the problem of detecting tables is not yet solved at all. Different approaches have different strengths and weak points. Some fail in certain situations or layouts where others perform better. How shall one know, which approach or system is the best for his specific job? The answer to this question raises the demand for an objective comparison of different approaches which address the same task of spotting tables and recognizing their structure.\n This paper describes our approach towards establishing a complete and publicly available, hence open environment for the benchmarking of table spotting and structural analysis. We provide free access to the ground truthing tool and evaluation mechanism described in this paper, describe the ideas behind and we also provide ground truth for the 547 documents of the UNLV and UW-3 datasets that contain tables.\n In addition, we applied the quality measures to the results that were generated by the T-Recs system which we developed some years ago and which we started to further advance since a few months."

We show that current evaluation scores are insufficient for diagnosing specific errors in page segmentation and fail to identify some classes of serious segmentation errors altogether. This paper introduces a vectorial score that is sensitive to, and identifies, the most important classes of segmentation errors (over, under, and mis-segmentation) and what page components (lines, blocks, etc.) are affected. Unlike previous schemes, our evaluation method has a canonical representation of ground-truth data and guarantees pixel-accurate evaluation results for arbitrary region shapes. We present the results of evaluating widely used segmentation algorithms (x-y cut, smearing, whitespace analysis, constrained text-line finding, docstrum, and Voronoi) on the UW-III database and demonstrate that the new evaluation scheme permits the identification of several specific flaws in individual segmentation methods."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."

The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore, we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale Chinese e-Book production."

                "text": "Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

We start by defining table. Then we describe the steps involved in extracting information from tables and analyse table-related research to place the contribution of different authors, find the paths research is following, and identify issues that are still unsolved. We then analyse current approaches to evaluating table processing algorithms and propose two new metrics for the task of segmenting cells/columns/rows. We proceed to design our own end-to-end method, where there is a higher interaction between different steps; we indicate how back loops in the usual order of the steps can reduce the possibility of errors and contribute to solving previously unsolved problems. Finally, we explore how the actual interpretation of the table not only allows inferring the accuracy of the overall extraction process but also contributes to actually improving its quality. In order to do so, we believe interpretation has to consider context-specific knowledge; we explore how the addition of this knowledge can be made in a plug-in/out manner, such that the overall method will maintain its operability in different contexts."
