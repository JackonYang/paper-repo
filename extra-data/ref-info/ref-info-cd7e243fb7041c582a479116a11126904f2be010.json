This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

In this dissertation, we present a unified document image structure extraction algorithm that is probability based, where the probabilities are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements of distances between the terminal and non-terminal entities with which the algorithm works. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the on-line segmentation module. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. This approach can be uniformly apply to the construction of the document hierarchy at any level. We have implemented a text line segmentation algorithm and a text block extraction algorithm using this framework. Another example is the development of a system that detects and recognizes special symbols (Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.) on technical document pages, that are not handled by the current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. \nA large quantity of ground-truth data, varying in quality, is required in order to give an accurate measurement of the performance of an algorithm under different conditions. \nWe have constructed the University of Washington English Document Image Database-III, which contains 1600 scanned scientific/technical document image pages that come with manually edited ground-truth of entity bounding boxes and properties. Based on the ground-truth data, we can evaluate the performance of document analysis algorithms and build statistical models to characterize various types of document image structures. In this dissertation, we present a set of quantitative performance metrics for each kind of information a document image analysis technique infers. The text line and text block extraction algorithms were trained and evaluated on the UW-III database using a cross-validation method. The text line extraction algorithm identifies and segments 99.76% of text lines correctly, while the preliminary result of the text block extraction shows 91% accuracy."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

                "text": "This paper presents an improved zone content classification method. Motivated by our novel background-analysis-based table identification research, we added two new features to the feature vector from one previously published method [7]. The new features are the total area of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the zone. A binary decision tree is used to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. The training and testing data sets for the algorithm include images drawn from the UWCDROM-III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, text classes (of font size pt and font size pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. The improved zone classification method raised the accuracy rate to from and reduced the median false alarm rate to from . 1 Problem Statement Let ! be a set of zone entities. Let \" be a set of content labels, such as text, table, math, etc. The function #%$&!(')\" associates each element of * with a label. The function +,$-!.'0/ specifies measurements made on each element of ! , where / is the measurement space. The zone content classification problem can be formulated as follows: Given a zone set ! and a content label set \" , find a classification function #1$2!3'4\" , that has the maximum probability: 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8 (1) In our current approach, we assume conditional independence between the zone classifications, so the probability in Equation 1 may be decomposed as 576 # 6 !98;: + 6 !98 8= @ A B 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 (2) The problem can be solved by maximizing each individual probability 576 # 6DC 8;: + 6DC 8 8 in Equation 2, where CFE ! . In our zone content classification experiment, the elements in set ! are zone groundtruth entities from UWCDROM III document image database [6]. The elements of set \" are text with font size GIH J pt, text with font size KLH M pt, math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. + 6DC 8 is a feature vector generated for C , where CNE ! . We used a decision tree classifier to compute the probability in Equation 2 and make the assignment. 2 Related Work and Paper Organization A complete document image understanding system can transform paper documents into a hierarchical representation of their structure and content. The transformed document representation enables document interchange, editing, browsing, indexing, filing and retrieval. The zone classification technique plays the key role in the success of such a document understanding system. Not only is it useful for successive applications such as OCR, table understanding, etc, but it can be used to assist and validate document segmentation. In the literature, Sivaramakrishnan et. al [7] extracted features for each zone such as run length mean and variance, spatial mean and variance, fraction of the total number of black pixels in the zone, and the zone width ratio for each zone. They used the decision tree classifier to assign a zone class on the basis of its feature vector. They did their experiments on MPO M document images from UWCDROM I image database. Liang et. al [5] developed a feature based zone classifier using only the knowledge of the widths and the heights of the connected components within a given zone. Le et. al [4] proposed an automated labeling of zones from scanned images with labels such as titles, authors, affiliations and abstracts. The labeling is based on features calculated from optical character recognition(OCR) output, neural network models, machine learning methods, and a set of rules that is derived from an analysis of the page layout for each journal and from generic typesetting knowledge for English text. We developed a novel background-analysis-based table identification technique. We repeated Sivaramakrishnan et. al\u2019s work [7] on a larger database with a goal to improve its performance on table zone classification. Although some background analysis techniques can be found in the literature([1],[2]), none of them, to our knowledge, has been used in the table identification problem. We added two new features: the total area of large horizontal and vertical blank blocks and the number of text glyphs in the given zone, to the original feature vector. We improved the accuracy rate and reduced the false alarm rates for most of the nine classes. The rest of this paper is divided into Q sections. section 3 gives the definitions of large horizontal and large vertical blank blocks. The two new features are described in section 4. A brief introduction to the decision tree classifier is given in section 5. The experimental results are reported in section 6. Our conclusion and statement of future work are discussed in section 7."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."

The approach is based on computational-geometry algorithms for off-line enumeration of maximal white rectangles and on-line rectangle unification. These support a fast, simple, and general heuristic for geometric layout segmentation, in which white space is covered greedily by rectangles until all text blocks are isolated. Design of the heuristic can be substantially automated by an analysis of the empirical statistical distribution of properties of covering rectangles: for example, the stopping rule can be chosen by Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron training algorithm. Experimental trials show good behavior on the large and useful class of textual Manhattan layouts. On complex layouts from English-language technical journals of many publishers, the method finds good segmentations in a uniform and nearly parameter-free manner. On a variety of non-Latin texts, some with vertical text lines, the method finds good segmentations without prior knowledge of page and text-line orientation."

Text paragraphs and areas of graphic type may be of any shape, individually rotated and in any arrangement. Previous document analysis techniques are not well suited to such complex layouts. This paper introduces a new method for the segmentation of images of document pages having both traditional and complex layouts. The underlining idea is to efficiently produce a flexible description (by means of tiles) of the background space which surrounds the printed regions in the page image under all the above conditions. Using this description of space, the contours of printed regions are identified with significant accuracy. The new approach is fast as there is no need for skew detection and correction, and only few simple operations are performed on the description of the background (not on the pixel-based data)."

The advantage is that great improvement can be achieved in computation. In fact, once bounding boxes of connected components are obtained, the recursive X-Y cut is completed within an order of a second on Sparc-10 workstations for letter-sized document images scanned at 900 dpi resolution."
