We consider two well-known opposing positions on this issue: one due to Alan Turing and one due to John Searle (via the Chinese Room). In particular, we argue against Searle, showing that his answer to the so-called System Reply does not work. The argument takes a novel form: we shift the debate to a different and more plausible room where the required conversational behaviour is much easier to characterize and to analyze. Despite being much simpler than the Chinese Room, we show that the behaviour there is still complex enough that it cannot be produced without appropriate mental qualities."

The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."

                "text": "We report on the recent Loebner prize competition inspired by Turing's test of intelligent behavior. The presentation covers the structure of the competition and the outcome of its first instantiation in an actual event, and an analysis of the purpose, design, and appropriateness of such a competition. We argue that the competition has no clear purpose, that its design prevents any useful outcome, and that such a competition is inappropriate given the current level of technology. We then speculate as to suitable alternatives to the Loebner prize. This report appeared in Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery, volume 37, number 6, pages 70-78, 1994. Also available as cmp-lg/9404002 and from the Center for Research in Computing Technology, Harvard University, as Technical Report TR-19-92. The Turing Test and the Loebner Prize The English logician and mathematician Alan Turing, in an attempt to develop a working definition of intelligence free of the difficulties and philosophical pitfalls of defining exactly what constitutes the mental process of intelligent reasoning, devised a test, instead, of intelligent behavior. The idea, codified in his celebrated 1950 paper ``Computing Machinery and Intelligence'' [28], was specified as an ``imitation game'' in which a judge attempts to distinguish which of two agents is a human and which a computer imitating human responses by engaging each in a wide-ranging conversation of any topic and tenor. Turing's reasoning was that, presuming that intelligence was only practically determinable behaviorally, then any agent that was indistinguishable in behavior from an intelligent agent was, for all intents and purposes, intelligent. It is presumably uncontroversial that humans are intelligent as evidenced by their conversational behavior. Thus, any agent that can be mistaken by virtue of its conversational behavior with a human must be intelligent. As Turing himself noted, this syllogism argues that the criterion provides a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for intelligent behavior. The game has since become known as the ``Turing test'', a term that has eclipsed even his eponymous machine in Turing's terminological legacy. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, computers would be able to pass the Turing test at a reasonably sophisticated level, in particular, that the average interrogator would not be able to identify the computer correctly more than 70 per cent of the time after a five minute conversation. On November 8, 1991, an eclectic group including academics, business people, press, and passers-by filled two floors of Boston's Computer Museum for a tournament billed as the first actual administration of the Turing test. The tournament was the first attempt on the recently constituted Loebner Prize established by New York theater equipment manufacturer Dr. Hugh Loebner and organized by Dr. Robert Epstein, President Emeritus of the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, a research center specializing in behaviorist psychology.

(1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. \u201cCould a machine think?\u201d On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking."

In creating this year's dataset, a number of longer texts were introduced to make the challenge more oriented to realistic scenarios. Additionally, a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools. A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

Most text processing research has focused on locating mission-relevant text (information retrieval) and on techniques for enriching text by transforming it to other forms of text (translation, summarization) \u2015 always for use by humans. In contrast, MR will make knowledge contained in text available in forms that machines can use for automated processing. This will be done with little human intervention. Machines will learn to read from a few examples and they will read to learn what they need in order to answer questions or perform some reasoning task. Three independent Reading Teams are building universal text engines which will capture knowledge from naturally occurring text and transform it into the formal representations used by Artificial Intelligence. An Evaluation Team is selecting and annotating text corpora with task domain concepts, creating model reasoning systems with which the reading systems will interact, and establishing question-answer sets and evaluation protocols to measure progress toward this goal. We describe development of the MR evaluation framework, including test protocols, linguistic resources and technical infrastructure."

                "text": "Daniel Kahneman, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is one of the world's most important thinkers. His ideas have had a profound impact on many fields - including business, medicine, and politics - but until now, he has never brought together his many years of research in one book. In \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\", Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. One system is fast, intuitive, and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities - and also the faults and biases - of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness - each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions. Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our professional and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" will transform the way you take decisions and experience the world."

The approach takes into account the full lexico-syntactic context of both the text and hypothesis and relies heavily on the concept of subsumption. It starts with mapping the text and hypothesis into graph structures where nodes represent concepts and edges represent lexico-syntactic relations among concepts. Based on a subsumption score between the text-graph and hypothesis-graph an entailment decision is then made. The impact of synonymy on entailment is quantified and discussed. An important advantage of our solution is the ability to customize it so that high-confidence results are obtained"

We provide several novel constructions of captchas. Since captchas have many applications in practical security, our approach introduces a new class of hard problems that can be exploited for security purposes. Much like research in cryptography has had a positive impact on algorithms for factoring and discrete log, we hope that the use of hard AI problems for security purposes allows us to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence. We introduce two families of AI problems that can be used to construct captchas and we show that solutions to such problems can be used for steganographic communication. captchas based on these AI problem families, then, imply a win-win situation: either the problems remain unsolved and there is a way to differentiate humans from computers, or the problems are solved and there is a way to communicate covertly on some channels."

Observable intelligent behaviour is indeed the ultimate goal according to Turing, but things do not stop there. The goal immediately raises a fundamental question: what sorts of computational mechanisms can possibly account for the production of this behaviour? And this question may well be answered in a principled and scientific way by postulating and testing for a variety of internal schemes and architectures. For example, what are we to make of a person who quietly reads a book with no external behaviour other than eye motion and turning pages? There can be a considerable gap between the time a piece of background knowledge is first acquired and the time it is actually needed to condition behaviour, such as producing the answer to a WS. The computational architecture articulated by John McCarthy (1968) was perhaps the first to offer an even remotely plausible story about how to approach something like the WS challenge."

However, only a limited number of tasks have so far been tested using Web-scale data sets. The present article overcomes this limitation by systematically investigating the performance of Web-based models for several NLP tasks, covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a wider range of n-grams and parts of speech than have been previously explored. For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus. In some cases, performance can be improved further by using backoff or interpolation techniques that combine Web counts and corpus counts. However, unsupervised Web-based models generally fail to outperform supervised state-of-the-art models trained on smaller corpora. We argue that Web-based models should therefore be used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative to, standard supervised models."
