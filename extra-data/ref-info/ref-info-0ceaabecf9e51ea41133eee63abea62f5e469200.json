The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

In this paper, an alternative theory is considered: Perhaps handwriting recognition makes use of information about how letters areformed, as well as of knowledge of static characteristics of letters, such as \u201cdistinctive features.\u201d In an experiment testing this hypothesis, subjects saw artificial characters drawn in real time and were later asked to identify distorted versions of the same characters presented statically. Subjects were faster on static characters distorted in a manner consistent with the drawing method they had witnessed than on static characters equally distorted but inconsistent with the drawing method. This finding suggests that humans can use dynamic information in the perception of static forms."
