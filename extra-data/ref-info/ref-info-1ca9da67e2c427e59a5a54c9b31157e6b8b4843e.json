                "text": "We describe an approach to object classification based on the conjunction of multiple classspecific object fragments detected in the image. The method represents members of a given class (such as a face, or a car) using combinations of common sub-structures, termed fragments. These fragments are partial 2-D patterns extracted from examples views of objects belonging to the class in question. An object view is covered by multiple, overlapping fragments of several types, and at multiple levels of complexity. We describe the detection of the individual fragments, and the combination of the fragments to detect complete objects. The combination of fragments to form a consistent overall arrangement is based in this scheme on a number of simple mechanisms: the use of overlapping fragments, a spatial `voting' scheme, and by imposing some constraints on the tolerated location of the fragments within the overall object view. We present experimental results of the application of the method to the detection of face and car views in cluttered scenes and to partially occluded objects. We present evidence that by combining fragments from different objects the method can deal successfully with intra-object variability within a class. The method is more economical and more resistant to occlusion and deformations than methods relying on global object views. Introduction In this paper we study the challenging task of detecting different objects from a given class (such as a face or a car) in an image. In addition to the unknown location and illumination of the object, the method must deal with intra-class variability between objects from the same class. The detection process must therefore cover a range of possible shapes, missing parts and additional clutter. To deal with the problem of shape variability and detect novel shapes of a given class, Turk & Pentland (1991) used the principal components of registered face views. Views of novel objects can be approximated by the superposition of several basis functions, or 'eigenfaces'. Poggio & Sung (1994) used a distribution-based modeling scheme for detecting faces in cluttered scenes. They represented a face view as a gray level vector with 283 components, and trained a multi-layered preceptron network to classify such data as face/non-face vectors. The generalization to novel shapes within the class is obtained in these schemes by the inherent generalization capacity of the neural network mechanism.

A two-stage, partially supervised learning architecture is proposed: a rudimentary detector is learned from a very small set of segmented images and applied to a larger training set of un-segmented images; the second stage bootstraps these detections to learn an improved classifier while explicitly training against clutter. The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a location-sensitive classifier using a discriminative set of features from a randomly chosen dictionary of contour fragments. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-the-art object detection schemes and show robustness to object articulations, clutter, and occlusion. Our major contributions are the application of boosted local contour-based features for object detection in a partially supervised learning framework, and an efficient new boosting procedure for simultaneously selecting features and estimating per-feature parameters."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented."

The technique is based on the intermediate representation of an image as a set of patches, which are extracted using an interest point detector. The learning problem becomes an instance of supervised learning from sets of unordered features. In order to solve this problem, we designed a classifier based on a simple, part based, generative object model. Only the appearance of each part is modeled. When learning the model parameters, we use a discriminative boosting algorithm which minimizes the loss of the training error directly. The models thus learnt have clear probabilistic semantics, and also maintain good classification performance. The performance of the algorithm has been tested using publicly available benchmark data, and shown to be comparable to other state of the art algorithms for this task; our main advantage in these comparisons is speed (order of magnitudes faster) and scalability."

We present a simple method for image description based on histograms of qualitative shape indexes computed from the combination of triplets of sampled locations and gradient directions in the image. We demonstrate that this method indeed is able to capture variation within classes of objects and we apply it to the problem of recognizing four different categories from a large database. Using our descriptor on the whole image, containing varying degrees of background clutter, we obtain results for two of the objects that are superior to the best results published so far for this database. By cropping images manually we demonstrate that our method has a potential to handle also the other objects when supplied with an algorithm for searching the image. We argue that our method, based on qualitative image properties, capture the large range of variation that is typically encountered within an object class. This means that our method can be used on substantially larger patches of images than existing methods based on simpler criteria for evaluating image similarity."

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

                "text": "This thesis is concerned with the problem of visual object categorization, that is of reeognizing unseen-before objects, localizing them in cluttered real-worid images, and assigning the correct category label. This capability is one of the core compe\u00ac tencies of the human visual system. Yet, Computer vision Systems are still far from reaching a comparable level of Performance.Moreover,Computer visionresearch has in the past mainly focused on the simpler and more specific problem of identifying known objects under novel viewing conditions. The visual categorization problem is closely linked to the task of figure-ground segmentation, that is of dividing the image into an object and a non-objeet part. Historically, figure-ground segmentation has often been seen as an important and even necessary preprocessing step for object recognition. However, purely bottomup approacheshave so far been unable to yield segmentationsof sufficient quality, so that most current recognition approacheshave been designed to work independently from segmentation. In contrast,this thesis considers object categorization and figure-ground segmen\u00ac tation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. The core part of our work is a probabilisticformulation which integrates both capabilities into a common framework. As shown in our experiments, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to profit from each other and improve their individual Performances. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically compute a segmentationfor them. This segmenta\u00ac tion is then used to again improve recognition by allowing the System to focus its effort on object pixels and discard misleading influencesfrom the background. In addition to improving the recognition Performance for individual hypotheses, the top-down segmentation also allows to determine exactly from where a hypoth\u00ac esis draws its support. We use this information to design a hypothesis verification stage based on the MDL principle that resolves ambiguities between overlapping hypotheseson a per-pixel level and factorsout the effects of partialocclusion. Altogether, this procedureconstitutes a novel mechanismin object detection that allows to analyze scenes containing multiple objects in a principled manner. Our results show that it presents an improvement over conventional criteria based on bounding box overlap and permitsmore aecurate aeeeptancedecisions. Our approach is based on a highly flexible implicit representation for object shape that can combine the information of local parts observed on different training exam\u00ac ples and interpolate between the correspondingobjects. As a result, the proposed method can learn object modeis already from few training examples and achieve competitive object detection Performance with training sets that are between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than those used in comparable Systems. An extensive evaluation on several large data sets shows that the system is applicable to many different object categories, including both rigid and articulated objects."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

The features capture natural local structures in the data and yield very high classification rates when used with a variety of classifiers trained on small training sets, exhibiting robustness to degradation with clutter. Of particular interest is the use of the features as variables in simple statistical models for the objects thus enabling likelihood based classification. Pre-training decision boundaries between classes, a necessary component of non-parametric techniques, are thus avoided. Class models are trained separately with no need to access data of other classes. Experimental results are presented for handwritten character recognition, classification of deformed BTEX symbols involving hundreds of classes, and side view car detection."

That is, given a novel image we want to recognize and localize unseen-before objects based on their similarity to a learned object category. For use in a real-world system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales. We present an experimental comparison of the influence of different interest point operators and quantitatively show the method's robustness to large scale changes."

To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

The regions are used in a similar way to the local interest points extracted from gray-level images, but they capture shape rather than texture. Local convexity is characterized by measuring the extent to which the detected image contours support circle or arc-like local structures at each position and scale in the image. Our saliency measure combines two cost functions defined on the tangential edges near the circle: a tangential-gradient energy term, and an entropy term that ensures local support from a wide range of angular positions around the circle. The detected regions are invariant to scale changes and rotations, and robust against clutter, occlusions and spurious edge detections. Experimental results show very good performance for both shape matching and recognition of object categories."

The first layer selects PCA-SIFT and shape context features and combines the two feature types to form a strong classifier. Although previous approaches have used either feature type to train an AdaBoost model, our approach is the first to combine these complementary sources of information into a single feature pool and to use Adaboost to select those features most important for class recognition. The second layer adds to these local and global descriptions information about the spatial relationships between features. Through comparisons to the training sample, we first find the most prominent local features in Layer I, then capture the spatial relationships between these features in Layer 2. Rather than discarding this spatial information, we therefore use it to improve the strength of our classifier. We compared our method to (R. Fergus et al., 2003, A. Opelt et al., 2004, J. Thureson et al., 2004) and in all cases our approach outperformed these previous methods using a popular benchmark for object class recognition (R. Fergus et al., 2003). ROC equal error rates approached 99%. We also tested our method using a dataset of images that better equates the complexity between object and non-object images, and again found that our approach outperforms previous methods."

These models provide a way of relating different spatial priors that have been used for recognizing generic classes of objects, including joint Gaussian models and tree-structured models. By providing explicit control over the degree of spatial structure, our models make it possible to study the extent to which additional spatial constraints among parts are actually helpful in detection and localization, and to consider the tradeoff in representational power and computational cost. We consider these questions for object classes that have substantial geometric structure, such as airplanes, faces and motorbikes, using datasets employed by other researchers to facilitate evaluation. We find that for these classes of objects, a relatively small amount of spatial structure in the model can provide statistically indistinguishable recognition performance from more powerful models, and at a substantially lower computational cost."

The resulting framework is able to recognize multi-object categories in different settings, from lab-controlled to real-world scenes. We present several experiments, on different databases, and we benchmark our results with state-of-the-art algorithms for categorization, achieving excellent results."

The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories.

The results demonstrate the superiority of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality, using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning."

The object is represented as a constellation of generalized correlograms that integrate both information of local parts and their spatial relations. Incorporating the spatial relations into our constellation of descriptors, we show that an exhaustive search for the best matching can be avoided. Combining the contextual descriptors with boosting, the system simultaneously learns the information that characterize each part of the object along with their characteristic mutual spatial relations. The proposed framework includes a matching step between homologous parts in the training set, and learning the spatial pattern after matching. In the matching part two approaches are provided: a supervised algorithm and an unsupervised one. Our results are favorably compared against state-of-the-art results."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

The algorithm has been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes.
