In the learning phase, a scene containing a single object is shown one at a time. The range data of a scene are obtained by a range finder. The description of each scene is built in terms of properties of regions and relations between them. This description is stored as an object model. In the recognition phase, an unknown scene is described in the same way as in the learning phase. Then the description is matched to the object models so that the stacked objects are recognized sequentially. Efficient matching is achieved by a combination of data-driven and model-driven search processes. Experimental results for blocks and machine parts are shown."

It covers even the most recent research and will provide a useful and current reference for professionals working in the fields of machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. \nAn outgrowth of the author's course at MIT, Robot Vision presents a solid framework for understanding existing work and planning future research. Its coverage includes a great deal of material that is important to engineers applying machine vision methods in the real world. The chapters on binary image processing, for example, help explain and suggest how to improve the many commercial devices now available. And the material on photometric stereo and the extended Gaussian image points the way to what may be the next thrust in commercialization of the results in this area. \nChapters in the first part of the book emphasize the development of simple symbolic descriptions from images, while the remaining chapters deal with methods that exploit these descriptions. The final chapter offers a detailed description of how to integrate a vision system into an overall robotics system, in this case one designed to pick parts out of a bin. \nThe many exercises complement and extend the material in the text, and an extensive bibliography will serve as a useful guide to current research. \nErrata (164k PDF)"

Emphasis is given to a method for extracting useful features from the scene data for complex industrial parts so that accurate recognition of them is possible. The proposed method has the following features: 1) simple features are detected first in the scene and more complex features are examined later, using the locations of the previously found features; 2) the system is provided with a high-level supervisor that analyzes the current information obtained from the scene and structural models of various objects, and proposes the feartures to be examined next for recognizing the objects in the scene; 3) the supervisor has problem-solving capabilities to select the most promising feature among many others; 4) the structural models are used to suggest the locations of the features to be examined; and 5) several sophisticated feature extractors are used to detect the complex features. An effort is also made to make the system versatile so that it can be readily applied to a variety of different industrial parts. The proposed system has been tested on several sets of parts for small industrial gasoline engines and the results were satisfactory."

A model-generator called GEOMAP generates a needle map which would be observed from the viewer direction determined from EGI. Comparing the needle map by the GEOMAP with the needle map by the photometric stereo system makes final recognition of the object."

In the case of arc welding, departures from the required part to part nominal path as well as information concerning the amount of weld metal required to fill a gap is provided by the vision system.

Objects are represented in terms of canonic 2D models which can be used to determine the identity, location and orientation of an unknown object. The reduction in dimensionality is achieved by factoring the space of all possible perspective projections of an object into a set of characteristic views, where each such view defines a characteristic-view domain within which all projections are topologically identical and related by a linear transformation. The characteristic views of an object can then be hierarchically structured for efficient classification. The line-junction labelling constraints are used to match a characteristic view to a given unknown-object projection, and determination of the unknown-object projection-to-characteristic view transformation then provides information about the identity as well as the location and orientation of the object."

It models both specific objects and generic classes of industrial parts. We concentrate on the problem of programming complex vision tasks. The models are used to guide a vision system interpreting industrial images. It identifies instances of objects, and odject classes, and extracts three dimensional information from monocular images. it can make use of depth information from stereo or projection ranging. The vision system relies on propagating symbolic algebraic constraints, both to predict image features and to extract three dimensional information from image feature measurements. This research is integrated with extensive research on finding image intensity boundaries in images and on surface description from stereo."

Current machine feeding technology is dominated by the use of human labor, mechanical feeders, or orientation preservation. All these techniques have problems and limitations that make an alternate solution desirable. Three vision algorithms are presented which enable a computer-controlled robot to acquire a single piece from a bin containing randomly placed identical pieces. The algorithms do not try to solve the problem by identifying the position and orientation of a piece in the bin. Rather, the algorithms recognize where there is a section of any piece which a particular type of gripper would be able to grasp with a reasonable chance of success. Thus the algorithms are holdsite driven and depend on the piece and gripper type. Vacuum cup and parallel-jaw gripper types are treated. The heuristically defined holdsites for vacuum cup grippers are patches of smooth surfaces; for parallel-jaw grippers, holdsites are opposing, linear, or curvilinear parallel edges. The three-dimensional position of holdsites cannot be computed from a single image of the bin. Thus once a hold-sight is identified, the gripper is made to travel along a line-of-sight path. The missing degree of freedom, distance from the holdsite to the camera, is obtained by a contact or noncontact proximity sensor in the gripper. Acquisition requires two other sensors: a grasping sensor to indicate success; and a mechanical overload sensor, to abort the attempt in case of error."

The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then \"grows\" a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.) Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration- understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin."

Compared with human vision, however, the capabilities of these specialized systems are still very rudimentary. In this paper, we will examine some important industrial vision requirements that are simple for humans to fulfill but well beyond the ability of any existing machine. We will try to understand what limitations of current systems make these tasks so hard for a machine and use this knowledge to outline the design of a general-purpose computer vision system, capable of high performance in a wide variety of industrial vision tasks. We will conclude by suggesting some promising research directions towards realizing such a system."

This paper describes a laser time-of-flight range scanner capable of acquiring a reasonable rangepic of 64 \u00d7 64 spatial resolution in 4 s. However, at the current state of development, 100 samples/point are required to achieve a range accuracy of approxi-mately \u00b1\u00bf cm, with a scan time of 40 s. Returned signal amplitude de-pendency is also apparent in the range determination, the dynamic range of intensity being considerable. Improved accuracy can be traded for tine. The vision/robotics laboratory environment within which the range scanner operates is briefly touched upon and some preliminary rangepic results presented."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

This paper identifies one algorithm that determines an object's orientation by matching object models to depth map data. The object models are constructed by mapping surface orien tation data onto spheres. This process is based on a mathe matical theorem that can be applied only to convex objects, but some extensions for nonconvex objects are presented. The paper shows that a global approach can be used successfully in cases where objects do not touch one another. Another important result illustrates the size of the space of rotations. It shows that even when 6,000 rotations are almost uniformly distributed for matching, errors of 17 degrees are still possible."

A short review of the leading ideas as a logical historical-intellectual edifice shows the determination of the approaches by the specific goals, apparatus and project progress. A special project as a paradigm for the whole problem is reported in detail with references to general considerations. The hand-eye project hardware is described in detail; this is based on a well-equipped standard minicomputer, a laser-deflector input and a 6 + 1 degree of freedom output. The hardware is only an experimental realization device of the software which includes the special operating system for this task, a disc-based handling of library programs, a dictionary-type semantic information storage, and a man-machine dialog with the visualization of the different problem-solving phases. Most details are devoted to the pattern recognition, a template-matching type of preprocessing, the definition and finding of picture primitives and a context-free programmed grammar using some Bayesian parameters for fast heuristics. The handling of lists, semantic procedures and the analysis by synthesis are specially elaborated. The grammatical-structural method proves to be the most powerful device for pattern recognition of industrial objects combined pragmatically with other ones."

This kind of robot has numerous applications in industries which manufacture discrete-part products in batches. A variety of approaches to the design of an orienting robot have been identified. For acquisition, gripper design and vision algorithms should be considered together. A vacuum gripper which adapts to surface angle and an algorithm which finds the center of smooth regions in the bin image have been shown to form an effective combination. Knowledge of the position and orientation of the workpieces near the top of the bin is not necessary for acquisition. Collisions with workpieces in the bin whose poses are not known can be avoided by having the gripper follow a line of sight approach path. To simplify the computation of workpiece orientation, it was found to be useful to employ a gripper which locked a workpiece in one of a finite number of states and which did not obscure the workpiece. For an orienting robot which is designed to service a variety of different workpieces, using an arm with six degrees of freedom greatly facilitates workpiece transportation."

Various issues related to representation and modeling of 3-D objects are addressed. A new method for the approximation of 3-D objects by a set of planar faces is discussed. The major advantage of this method is that it is applicable to a complete object and not restricted to single range view which was the limitation of the previous work in 3-D scene analysis. The method is a sequential region growing algorithm. It is not applied to range images, but rather to a set of 3-D points. The 3-D model of an object is obtained by combining the object points from a sequence of range data images corresponding to various views of the object, applying the necessary transformations and then approximating the surface by polygons. A stochastic labeling technique is used to do the shape matching of 3-D objects. The technique matches the faces of an unknown view against the faces of the model. It explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. It is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. The objective here is to match the individual views of the object taken from any vantage point. Details of the algorithm are presented and the results are shown on several unknown views of a complicated automobile casting."

The method is used to locate complex industrial parts that may contain several occurrences of local features, such as holes and corners. The matching process utilizes clusters of mutually consistent features to hypothesize objects and also uses templates of objects to verify these hypotheses. The technique is fast because it concentrates on key features that are automatically se lected on the basis of a detailed analysis of computer- aided design (CAD) models of the objects. The automatic analysis applies general-purpose routines for building and analyzing representations of clusters of local features that could be used in procedures to select features for other lo cational strategies. These routines include algorithms for computing the rotational and mirror symmetries of objects in terms of their local features."

Two basic tools are employed: the photometric stereo method and the extended Gaussian image. The photometric stereo method generates the surface normal distribution of a scene. The extended Gaussian image allows us to determine the attitude of the object based on the normal distribution. visual analysis of an image consists of two stages. The first stage segments the image into regions and determines the target region.The photometric stereo system provides the surface normal distribution of the scene. The sytem segments the scene into isolated regions using ghe surface normal distribution rathan than the brightness distribuiton. The second stage determines the object attitude and position by comparing the surface normal distribution with the extended-Gaussian-image. Fingers, with LED sensor, mounted on the PUMA arm can successfully pick an object from a pile based on the information from the vision part. (Author)"

The efficacy of these techniques for any given application depends on both technical and economic considerations. This paper will explore both these considerations using appropriate generic examples. It is our goal to first present a concise discussion of the present state of many technical and economic factors and then extrapolate these factors into the future for the purpose of guiding further investigations."

The EGI is constructed by mapping each surface normals of an object to the Gaussian sphere. \n \nThe freedom in viewer directions caused by incomplete observation Is greatly reduced by applying constraints derived from a global distribution of surface normals on the EGI. One constraint on the viewer direction is derived from the ratio of the projected area to the original surface area. The other constraint comes from the direction of the principal axis. After reducing the possible viewing directions with these constraints, we will apply a matching function to ESls of a candidate set for a final decision. \n \nWe also propose an algorithm for reconstruction of the original shape of a convex polyhedron from its EGI. This algorithm is based on the analysis-by-synthesis method."

Shape matching is viewed as a ``segment matching'' problem. Unlike the previous work, the technique is based on a stochastic labeling procedure which explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. To reduce the computation time, the technique is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. This basic technique has been extended to the situation where various objects partially occlude each other to form an apparent object and our interest is to find all the objects participating in the occlusion. In such a case several hierarchical processes are executed in parallel for every object participating in the occlusion and are coordinated in such a way that the same segment of the apparent object is not matched to the segments of different actual objects. These techniques have been applied to two-dimensional simple closed curves represented by polygons and the power of the techniques is demonstrated by the examples taken from synthetic, aerial, industrial and biological images where the matching is done after using the actual segmentation methods."

The instrument uses active triangulation and employs an optical bandpass filter to minimize the effects of ambient illumination. Its use of a single photodetecting element, a photomultiplier, is a unique feature among scanning triangulation rangefinders. A novel scanning configuration based on spherical coordinates is employed, resulting in an extremely large field of view. Nearly 75% of the surrounding solid angle is accessible. Reasonably high speed and accuracy are obtained. The typical error in range at a range of 50 in. is .12 in. The typical error in either of the two angular coordinates is .03\u00b0. The maximum instantaneous rate of acquisition of range samples is 500 Hz. Much higher speed and accuracy appear achievable with various modifications and improvements. This type of rangefinder appears most useful in automatic surveillance and robot navigation applications, because of its large field of view."

If the features are not uniquely characterized by their local appearances, as is often the case in programmable assembly, the matching technique must base its decisions on the relative structure of the features. In this paper we describe a technique that uses the relative positions and orientations of the features to determine the correspondence between features of an object model and features observed in a picture. A graph is constructed in which maximal cliques (i.e., completely connected subgraphs) represent mutually consistent assignments of model features to observed features. The technique is a robust, general-purpose way to match structures. However, in practical applications its use is restricted to moderately sized graphs because the algorithm that locates maximal cliques is apparently exponential. For tasks that require the analysis of large graphs a few techniques are presented to reformulate them so that smaller graphs are sufficient."

The technique forms all possible pairs of image features and model features which match on the basis of local evidence alone. For each possible pair of matching features the parameters of an RST (rotation, scaling, and translation) transformation are derived. Clustering in the space of all possible RST parameter sets reveals a good global transformation which matches many image features to many model features. Results with a variety of data sets are presented which demonstrate that the technique does not require sophisticated feature detection and is robust with respect to changes of image orientation and content. Examples in both cartography and object detection are given."

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

Importantly, they can also be determined simply from geometric models of the objects. Extended Gaussian images can be of use in at least two of the tasks facing a machine vision system: 1. recognition, and 2. determining the attitude in space of an object.

Saliency measures the extent to which the boundary segment distinguishes the object to which it belongs from other objects which might be present. An algorithm is presented which optimally determines the saliency of boundary segments of one object with respect to those of a set of other objects. An efficient template matching algorithm using templates weighted by boundary segment saliency is then presented and employed to recognize partially occluded parts. The results of these experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the new technique."

Surface model descriptions specify an object by its boundaries or enclosing surfaces using primitives such as edge and face. Baumgart\u2019s [ 19721 \u201cwinged edge\u201d representation for planar polyhedral objects is an elegant example of this type of model. Volume representations describe an object in terms of solids such as generalized cylinders, cubes, spheres, and rectangular blocks. The main advantage of this class of representations is that it provides an exact description that is object centered. The main disadvantage is that it is difficult to use in a real-time object-recognition system since the processing necessary to perform either 2-D to 3-D or 3-D to 2-D projections (for matching 2-D observed image features with a 3-D model) is very costly. For example, in the ACRONYM system [Brooks and Binford 19811 camera constraints are built in so as to limit the number of 3-D to 2-D projections that must be hypothesized and computed at run time. Multiview feature representation can include the work on storing 2-D descriptions for each stable configuration of an object. We restrict our discussion here to coordinated representations of multiple views that permit the specification of efficient matching procedures that take advantage of intraview and interview feature similarities. One class of multiview representations is based on the description of the churacteristic views of an object. This requires the specification of all topologically distinct views. Koenderink and vanDoorn [1976a, 1976b,1979] are studying the properties of the set of viewing positions around an object, and the qualitative nature of the stability of most viewing positions. That is, small changes in viewing position do not affect the topological structure of the set of visible object features (i.e., point and line singularities). On the basis of the topological equivalence of neighboring viewpoints, they define an \u201caspect graph\u201d of featuredistinct viewpoints (see Figure 15). Fuchs et al. [1980] have also used this idea to perform a recursive partitioning of a 3-D scene using the polygons that describe the surfaces of the constituent 3-D objects."

It presents a compact relational structure representation derived by generalizing the properties of objects. Objects are described by means of surface primitives (basic descriptive elements) and relations between the primitives. The essence of the representation is the use of a single primitive to describe all identical parts. The representation involves abstracting properties of individual scene elements. Similarly, relations between parts of objects that hold for particular instances of the objects are generalized to ensure that they will be valid for all instances. Common primitives and relations are shared both within and across models. This leads to a compact representation that has many desirable properties. A computer implementation of a version of the representation has been developed. It is used to illustrate the descriptive power of the representation. A recognition system has been developed that takes advantage of the representation in its operation. It is described elsewhere (Shneier (1977), Shneier (1978))."

An experimental robot system using vision and a parallel jaw gripper was able to acquire randomly oriented cylindrical workpieces piled in bins. Binary image analysis was adequate to guide the gripper into the multilayered, piles. Complementary information was provided by simple sensors on the gripper. Experiments were performed using titanium cylinders 6 cm \u00d7 15 cm diameter and 7.6 cm \u00d7 3 cm diameter. Cycle times to acquire a cylinder and deliver it to a receiving chute ranged from 8 to 10 s when a single supply of one-size cylinders was used. By using a dual supply bin configuration with one bin of each size and overlapping arm motion and image analysis tasks, the cycle times for one cylinder from alternate bins ranged from 5.5 to 7.5 s per piece. In the future robots with such capabilities can be applied to enhance automation applications, especially in small batch production."

An automatic method of visually estimating the pose of a workpiece in a robot hand has been investigated. This method is applicable to workpieces that have six continuous unknown degrees of freedom. Furthermore, partial occlusion of the workpiece by the robot hand is allowed. Workpiece pose was estimated using the three-dimensional locations of at least three noncollinear workpiece feature points. A second view of the workpiece was obtained by rotating the workpiece in front of the camera. Corresponding image features on the second view were found by searching along lines on the image which were determined by the rotation of the workpiece. A very accurate camera calibration procedure has been developed to compute rays in space from image locations. The location of workpiece features was computed by trigonometric relations between rays of corresponding image features from two views of the workpiece. The pose of a workpiece was estimated by the correspondence between the workpiece features located and the feature points of a workpiece model. Experiments have been performed on a complete functional system. The major limitation of the current system was due to the image feature extraction algorithm which only detected corners and small holes."

As in many applications the environment to be displayed consists of polygons many of whose relative geometric relations are static, we attempt to capitalize on this by preprocessing the environment's database so as to decrease the run-time computations required to generate a scene. This preprocessing is based on generating a \u201cbinary space partitioning\u201d tree whose in order traversal of visibility priority at run-time will produce a linear order, dependent upon the viewing position, on (parts of) the polygons, which can then be used to easily solve the hidden surface problem. In the application where the entire environment is static with only the viewing-position changing, as is common in simulation, the results presented will be sufficient to solve completely the hidden surface problem."

Such images are known as intrinsic images, and examples are images of velocity (optical flow), surface orientation, occluding contour, and disparity. While intrinsic images are not segmented, they are distinctly easier to segment than the original intensity image. Segments can be detected by a general Hough transform technique. Networks of feature parameters are appended to the intrinsic image organization. Then the intrinsic image points are mapped into these networks. This mapping will be many-to-one onto parameter values that represent segments. \n \nThis basic method is extended into a general representation and control technique with the addition of three main ideas: abstraction levels; sequential search; and tight counting These ideas are a nucleus of a connectionist theory of low 'eve and m'ermediate-level vision. This theory explains segmentation in terms of massively parallel cooperative computation among intrinsic images and a set of parameter spaces at different levels of abstraction."

Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify, however. Furthermore, robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must, therefore, be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming, especially for compliant motion. This paper describes a formal approach to the synthesis of compliant-motion strategies from geometric descriptions of assembly operations and explicit estimates of errors in sensing and control. A key aspect of the approach is that it provides criteriafor correct ness of compliant-motion strategies."

At the heart of such systems are symbol structures (representations) designating \"abstract solids\" (subsets of Euclidean space) that model physical solids. Representations are the sources of data for procedures which compute useful properties of objects. The variety and uses of systems embodying representations of solids are growing rapidly, but so are the difficulties in assessing current designs, specifying the characteristics that future systems should exhibit, and designing systems t9 meet such specifications. This paper resolves many of these difficulties by providing a coherent view, based on sound theoretical principles, of what is presently known about the representation of solids. The paper is divided into three parts. The first introduces a simple mathematical framework for characterizing certain important aspects of representations, for example, their semantic (geometric) integrity. The second part uses the framework to describe and compare all of the major knownschemes fo~ representing solids. The third part briefly surveys extant geometric modeling systems and then applies the concepts developed in the paper to the high-level design of a multiple*representation geometric modeling system which exhibits a level of reliability and versatility supermr to that of systems currently used in industrial computer-aided design and manufacturing."

A surface segment of a solid object is a partial description of the object's surface, usually limited to the surface area that can be reconstructed from two corresponding images of the object in an arbitrary orientation. Each surface segment is defined in its 3D coordinate system. The matching algorithm uses heuristic search to align overlapping surface segments of an object into a common 3D coordinate system. It searches for a rigid 3D transformation which minimizes shape differences between a pair of surface segments. Once this transformation is determined, the surface segments are merged into a new segment. This match-and-merge process is iteratively repeated for pairs of available surface segments until a complete model of the object is assembled."

The VS-100 system (and the related system for Puma robots, Univision I) accepts images up to 256 X 256 and thresholds them at a user-specified gray level. Up to 12 objects can be in an image and up to 13 features can be used to model each part. Recognition times of from 250 milliseconds (ms) (1 feature) to 850 ms (11 features) per object are typical [Rosen and Gleason 1981]. The Autovision 4 system processes images up to 512 X 256, and recognition performance is listed at over 10 parts per second for simple parts [Villers 1983]. Birk et al.

These features are edges represented by a description of their curvature in terms of an equation and endpoints. The main feature is the most obvious one found in an object, and it is used to imply the presence of the object during the initial stage of the search. Successful detection of the main feature generates clues for verifying the recognition. Secondary features are details of the object. These are chosen on the basis of the ease with which they may be found in a scene. For recognizing a cup, for example, the main feature can be a pair of vertical edges corresponding to the sides of a cup, and the secondary features can be other detail contours connected to the sides. Model. Stockman et al. [1982] have proposed a method in which models of 2-D objects are defined by organizing (1) real vectors describing boundary segments and (2) abstract vectors linking primitive features (e."

Crucial information about three-dimensional structure is provided by the spatial distribution of surface markings, particularly for static monocular views: Projection distorts texture geometry in a manner tha depends systematically on surface shape and orientation. To isolate and measure this projective distortion in an image is to recover the three dimensional structure of the textured surface. For natural textures, we show that the uniform density assumption (texels are uniformly distributed) is enough to recover the orientation of a single textured plane in view, under perspective projection. Furthermore, when the texels cannot be found, the edges of the image are enough to determine shape, under a more general assumption, that the sum of the lengths of the contours on the world plane is about the same everywhere. Finally, several experimental results for synthetic and natural images are presented."

This language seems to be particularly adequate for the automatic processing of the CAD/CAM system. The description method of machine parts, developed in the paper, is associated not only with individual parts but also with their classes. Each of these classes is created by parts of \u201csimilar shapes.\u201d This similarity is determined by the \u201cstructure\u201d (configuration) of primitives in contours describing machine parts. This structure is defined in a syntactic manner by means of a formal language generated by the extended context-free grammar (ECFg for short). The right hand sides of the production rules of ECFg are regular expressions over the terminal and non-terminal symbols. It appears quite natural to assume that ECFg generating contours (which uniquely determine machine parts) is in the so-called chain form. ECFGg in the chain form is a modification of the simple chain grammar which has been introduced and investigated by Ni..."

The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each picture element. Traditional stereo techniques determine range by relating two images of an object viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between picture elements is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine this correspondence. In photometric stereo, the imaging geometry does not change. Therefore, the correspondence between picture elements is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded at a single picture element, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features."

The device works on the same triangulation principle as an ordinary stereo camera, but involves an active camera (coded-laser-beam-array projector), a passive camera (TV), and the software for pattern synchronization and analysis. The system involves (1) a single laser beam; (2) interference optics to transform the single beam into an array of laser beams; (3) a programmable electro-optic shutter which can block or transmit various subsets of the laser beams in the array; (4) a TV camera to view the environmental surfaces illuminated by the laser beam array; and (5) a processor which controls the shutter, synchronizes the shutter with the TV camera, and decodes the contents of the TV images of the different coded patterns projected on the environment. The system is being developed for rapid biomedical surface mapping but can also be used in vision aid for the blind, robot vision, assembly-line inspection, data acquisition for 3-D pattern recognition, and the monitoring of large surfaces and volumes (dams, construction processes, security areas, etc.)."

The attitude of an object is greatly constrained by the global distribution of EGI mass over the visible Gaussian hemisphere. Constraints on the viewer direction are derived from the position of the EGI mass center, and from the direction of the EGI inertia axis. The algorithm embodying these constraints and teh EGI mass distribution are implemented using a lookup table. A function for matching an observed EGI with the prototypical EGIs is also proposed. The algorithm determines the attitude of an object successfully both from a synthesized needle map and a real needle map. (Author)"

The method, referred to as photometric stereo, can be implemented using table lookup based on numerical inversion of reflectance maps. Here we concentrate on objects with specularly reflecting surfaces, since these are of importance in industrial applications. Previous methods, intended for diffusely reflecting surfaces, employed point source illumination, which is quite unsuitable in this case. Instead, we use a distributed light source obtained by uneven illumination of a diffusely reflecting planar surface. Experimental results are shown to verify analytic expressions obtained for a method employing three light source distributions."

The position of the bonding pad is found, generally in real-time, by the recognition device and computer. The computer calculates positional data of all bonding pads and stores them on a cassette tape for a subsequent wire-bonding process. The position recognition methods discussed are composed of a thresholding algorithm and a position-finding algorithm. These methods are evaluated from the viewpoint of thresholding stability, recognition rate and positional accuracy."

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

The system is composed of a minicomputer, image processors, and a maximum of 50 wire-bonding machines. Each machine has a TV camera installed to pick up, through a microscope, the image of transistor chips fed into the machine. In this system, one image processor services several machines in a group and analyzes the image signals in a time-sharing mode to determine the chip position at each machine. From the detected coordinates, an XY servomechanism in each machine is activated to bond and stretch wires between the electrodes on the chip and the outer leads. The recognition of electrode positions is accomplished by the multiple local pattern matching method in which redundancy is used in achieving a high recognition rate. An analysis of the system and basic features of the position recognition algorithm are also described. This method opens the possibility of economical automation of processes possible only by the human eye to date."

We deduce the necessary structure of the internal model and we show how the organism can extract this structure from the invariant features of the sensory input transformations.

When such operators are passed over an image in raster fashion, features such as the following are detected: a strong peak in the direction histogram indicating the presence of a relatively straight edge, a second strong direction indicating a corner, a wide direction group indicating a curved edge, and a uniform distribution of directions over the histogram indicating small holes. Diameter-limited optimization can be used to substantially reduce the number of pixels which have been given feature labels by such operators without losing descriptive power. Feature labels for direction histograms having a second strong direction, a wide direction group, or a uniform distribution might be retained only if all other pixels within a circular aperture have a lower bin value. Pixels with a strong direction label might be retained only if all other pixels within a circular aperture and along the gradient direction have a smaller bin value. Tracking can then be applied to the remaining strong direction pixels in the direction perpendicular to the gradient to achieve representation of edges by endpoints. Experimental results indicate that descriptions which are compatible with human interpretation can be achieved."

A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out."

Region segmentation using edge points has not been very successful in the past because small gaps would allow merging of dissimilar regions. The present method uses an expansion-contraction technique in which the edge regions are first expanded to close gaps and then contracted after the separate uniform regions have been identified. In order to preserve small uniform regions, the process is performed iteratively from small to large expansions with no expansion for edge regions that separate different uniform regions. The final result is a set of uniform intensity regions (usually less than 100) and a set of edge boundary regions. The program has successfully segmented scenes with industrial parts, landscapes, and integrated circuit chips."

Radiometric methods are susceptible to systematic errors such as: errors in the measurement of light source orientations; mismatched light source irradiance; detector nonlinearity; the presence of specular reflection or shadows; the spatial and spectral distribution of incident light; surface size, material, and microstructure; and the length and properties of the light source to target path. Typically, a 1\u00b0 error in surface orientation of a Lambertian workpiece is caused by a 1 percent change in image intensity due to variations in incident light intensity or a 1\u00b0 change in orientation of a collimated light source. Tests on a white nylon sphere indicate that by using modest error prevention and calibration schemes, surface angles off the camera axis can be computed within 5\u00b0, except at edge pixels. Equations for the sensitivity of surface normals to major error sources have been derived. Results of surface normal estimation and edge extraction experiments on various non-Lambertian and textured workpieces are also presented."

Second, objects are hypothesized by determining whether a pair of observed segments are consistent with a given model\u2019s features. Silberberg et al. [1984] model an object using a multiview representation to define a Hough space of possible transformations of a set of 3-D line segments (edges), which are observable surface markings on the given object in a given viewpoint. They use a generalized Hough transform to match a set of observed line segments with model lines for each viewpoint. A 3-D Hough space is used to represent a viewpoint (two dimensions for position on the view-sphere, one dimension for orientation at a viewpoint). For each viewpoint and pair of line segments, one from a model and one from the image, the model line is projected onto the image plane, incrementing the corresponding bin in Hough space if the pair of lines match. This procedure is first used with a coarsely quantized Hough space to select a few, approximate, candidate viewpoint regions. Next, each of these viewpoint regions is successively refined to provide a finer resolution estimate of the exact viewing position. Chakravarty and Freeman [1982] define a multiview model using characteristic views for recognizing curved and polyhedral objects."

Theory and experiments are described using these principles and others to find the range of stiffness values for a running track that both lowers the potential for injuries and increases running speed."

Intrinsic scene parameters include surface range, orientation, discontinuities, reflectance, illumination, color, and velocity. Since this local information is obtained over a whole region within some boundaries, it is more robust than the edge-based techniques used with many of the 2-D representations discussed in the previous section. All of the methods in this section use scene surface properties derived from a single viewpoint to define features and construct models. If multiple views of an object are required, each is modeled independently. We have included range maps as part of this class of representation despite the fact that 3-D data are used. This is because the models that use these data are viewer centered and emphasize the description of observable surface features from a single viewpoint. Models that describe a complete (viewpoint-insensitive) 3-D object are included in the next section as 3-D representations. Most current research is focusing on the problem of how to compute these intrinsic surface maps. See, for example, Ballard and Brown [1982], Barrow and Tenenbaum [ 19781, Brady [1982a], Jarvis [1983a], and Marr [ 19821, for surveys of many applicable techniques. The present survey does not consider this \u201cmeasurement\u201d stage. Of particular interest for applications in industrial-parts recognition is the computation and use of range maps and local surface-orientation (needle) maps. Jarvis [1983a] and Poje and Delp [1982] give recent overviews of range-finding techniques using both active and passive methods."

This model consists of the specification of the possible relative positions of the four corners of a chip. A set of four 4 x 4 templates is used to evaluate the probability that a corner is present at a given position. A coarse processing stage is applied to the gray-scale image before the relational template-matching step. In this step the approximate orientation of the chip is determined by analyzing the edge-orientation histogram to find the most prominent edge orientation. This enables the matching stage to search for corners in known orientations. Cheng and Huang [1982] have developed a method for recognizing curvilinear objects by matching relational structures."

Models are automatically constructed by analyzing a prototype part in its different stable positions. The matching is done first by generating a hypothesis of the object location and then by matching model segments to scene segments. The model location is sequentially adjusted by evaluating each match until the best match is found. Bhanu has developed a hierarchical relaxation labeling technique for shape matching and has performed experiments using 2-D occluded industrial parts [Bhanu 1983; Bhanu and Faugeras 19841. Twodimensional shapes are used as the global structural features, and they are represented by a polygonal approximation. The technique involves the maximization of an evaluation function which is based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification.
