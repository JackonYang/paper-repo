Up to the first order, these deformations can be written in terms of an affine transform. A novel approach is adopted to measuring affine transforms which correctly handles the problem of corresponding deformed patches. The patches are filtered using Gaussians and derivatives of Gaussians and the filters deformed according to the affine transform. The problem of finding the affine transform is therefore reduced to that of finding the appropriate deformed filter to use. In the special case where the affine transform can be written as a scale change and an in-plane rotation, the Gaussian and first derivative equations are solved for the scale. The robustness of the method is demonstrated experimentally.<<ETX>>"

If two successive video frames are considered, their differences are approximately a linear combination of the components of the displacement of the object. If all the points of the frame undergo the same movement, then the velocity estimation problem is solved using linear estimation. However, if some points belong to the moving object and the others to the background, the problem can be stated in the same way only if an algorithm is available to segment the image into fixed and moving areas. Afterwards, linear estimation can be applied to the moving area only. In this paper a segmentation algorithm is proposed which uses dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm with three states). A more complex situation arises when the points belonging to the moving area are subjected to different movements. The problem can be solved once more using dynamic programming if the displacement components are quantized into (2M + 1) (2M + 1) values, and the number of states of the Viterbi algorithm is augmented to (2M + 1)^{2} . To reduce the technical difficulties of this approach, a simpler method that makes possible the estimation of the n most probable displacements is proposed. Then the image is segmented into n moving areas with different displacements and a background area using a Viterbi algorithm with n + 1 states. Experimental results show that the precision obtainable is about 0.1 pel when the displacements are up to 2-3 pels, the object had approximate dimensions of 90 \\times 90 pels, and the signal-to-noise ratio was higher than 33 dB."

Given the signals and a window, there are two factors that determine the difficulty of obtaining precise matching. The first is the variation of the signal within the window, which must be large enough, relative to noise, that the SSD values exhibit a clear and sharp minimum at the correct disparity. The second factor is the variation of disparity within the window, which must be small enough that signals of corresponding positions are duly compared. These two factors present conflicting requirements to the size of the matching window, since a larger window tends to increase the signal variation, but at the same time tends to include points of different disparity. A window size must be adaptively selected depending on local variations of signal and disparity in order to compute a most-certain estimate of disparity at each point.There has been little work on a systematic method for automatic window-size selection. The major difficulty is that, while the signal variation is measurable from the input, the disparity variation is not, since disparities are what we wish to calculate. We introduce here a statistical model of disparity variation within a window, and employ it to establish a link between the window size and the uncertainty of the computed disparity. This allows us to choose the window size that minimizes uncertainty in the disparity computed at each point. This article presents a theory for the model and the resultant algorithm, together with analytical and experimental results that demonstrate their effectiveness."

Expressions for the correlation functions and power density spectra of these signals are developed assuming an infinite image field undergoing uniform linear motion. These expressions are modified so as to include the effect of camera integration. Experimentally obtained power spectra are in good agreement with those predicted. Three-dimensional frame-difference correlation functions are evaluated using a realistic image correlation function. The properties of the frame-difference correlation functions in directions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of movement, and in the temporal direction are delineated. It is shown that the correlation function of the frame-difference signal arising from temporally uncorrelated noise is fundamentally different in updated areas compared with nonupdated areas."

A computer has been programmed to drive the cart through cluttered indoor and outdoor spaces, gaining its knowledge of the world entirely from images broadcast by the onboard TV system. The cart uses several kinds of stereo to locate objects around it in 3D and to deduce its own motion. It plans an obstacle avoiding path to a desired destination on the basis of a model built with this information. The plan changes as the cart perceives new obstacles on its journey. The system is reliable for short runs, but slow. The cart moves one meter every ten to fifteen minutes, in lurches. After rolling a meter it stops, takes some pictures and thinks about them for a long time. Then it plans a new path, executes a little of it, and pauses again. The program has successfully driven the cart through several 20 meter indoor courses (each taking about five hours) complex enough to necessitate three or four avoiding swerves. A less successful outdoor run, in which the cart skirted two obstacles but collided with a third, was also done. Harsh lighting (very bright surfaces next to very dark shadows) giving poor pictures and movement of shadows during the cart's creeping progress were major reasons for the poorer outdoor performance. The action portions of these runs were filmed by computer controlled cameras. (Author)"
