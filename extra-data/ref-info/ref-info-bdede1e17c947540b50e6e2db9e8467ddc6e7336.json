The first paper in this report, 'Embeddability of weighted graphs in k-space is strongly NP-hard,' examines the problem of assigning the vertices of a weighted graph to points in a k-dimensional Euclidean space subject to the constraint that any two vertices connected by an edge must be assigned to points whose distance is the weight of that edge. We prove (by reduction from 3-satisfiability) that it is NP-hard to determine whether such an assignment exists, even when k=1 and the edge weights are restricted to take on the values 1 and 2. The same reduction used in this proof forms the basis of proofs of the NP-completeness of several variants of the original problem. The second paper, 'Dynamic-programming algorithms for recognizing small-bandwidth graphs in polynomial time,' deals with the problem of bandwidth minimization, in which we are given a graph, G, and a positive integer, k, and whether it is possible to assign the vertices of G to distinct integers subject to the constraint that no edge of G may have its endpoints mapped to integers which differ by more than k. Although the general problem has been proven (by C. H. Papadimitriou) to be NP-complete, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed value of k. As in the first paper, the methods used to achieve the principal result are extended to a number of related problems. (Author)"

Because the problem is analogous to that of constructing a pin-Jointed structure from rigid bars (of given respective lengths), it is intimately linked to problems of structural rigidity. In addition to its practical significance, the problem leads to a number of surprising results and intriguing theoretical problems in geometry, combinatorics, and algorithm design. This paper presents some of the theoretical algorithmic aspects of the position-location problem; its major objective is to attract researchers to complexity problems of structural rigidity. Among the major results presented is the discovery of a large class of geometrical decision problems, all of which are randomly decidable (i.e., decidable by a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm), but many of which seem to be Intractable."

We use a theoretical VLSI model to reduce this problem to one of laying out a graph, where the transistors and wires of the circuit are identified with the vertices and edges of the graph. We give an algorithm that produces VLSI layouts for classes of graphs that have good separator theorems. We show in particular that any planar graph of n vertices has an O(n lg-square(n)) area layout and that any tree of n vertices can be laid out in linear area. The algorithm maintains a sparse representation for layouts that is based on the well-known UNION-FIND data structure, and as a result, the running time devoted to management of this representation is nearly linear.

Under certain assumptions on the possible types of short circuits, we analyze the structure of such graphs and show that a well-known and efficient algorithm can be used to color them with a small number of colors. In particular, we show that no more than 5, 8, or 12 colors (depending on the particular assumptions) will ever be required for such a graph, independent of the number of vertices. Thus, in such cases, the potential advantage of the proposed method over exhaustive testing could be considerable."

But it is unusual to see a program actually draw trees for visual inspection. Although part of the difficulty lies in programming graphics devices, most of the problem arises because naive algorithms to draw trees use too much drawing space and sophisticated algorithms are not obvious. We survey two naive tree drawers, formalize aesthetics for tidy trees, and descnbe two algorithms which draw tidy trees. One of the algorithms may be shown to require the minimum possible paper width. Along with the algorithms proper, we discuss the reasoning behind the algorithm development."
