                "text": "P e historical record of computing is s till meager. This is to be expected since the topic is, at best, a century and a half old. Even of that, the field lay fallow for the first half century after Babbage cut his deep furrows. The next half century was a period of prehistory, a time of unconscious formation shaped largely by the hand of a single man, Hollerith. Only in the mid-thirties, with Turing and his contemporaries, did the field begin to take on recognizable and lasting contours. Hence, the record is rudimentary, largely a liturgy of dates, men, machines, and acronyms, reminiscent of the monastic chronicles of the Middle Ages. The first good history of a nation, field, or whatever, is probably to be found in the biographies of its giants. By leavening the flat plain of events with the lives of great men, history takes on perspective and humanity. Good biographies of the seminal figures in computer science are beginning to appear. This issue of the \"Book Reviews\" column is devoted to three such biographies of computing co-lossi: Charles Babbage, Herman Hol-lerith, and Alan Turing. As suggested earlier, these men stand as beacons, at half century intervals, along the route to contemporary computing. Among the three are interesting parallels and differences that illuminate the nature of computing. Two were mathematicians ; one was an engineer and a business man. The mathematicians conceptualized computers, but could never build them; the engineer built numerous machines to process information, but never attempted to abstract automatic information processing. All were brilliant, independent, and uncompromising, and ran afoul of government bureaucracy. One thing seems to bind them together. Each struggled to reconcile and harmonize the abstract with the concrete. In Babbage's case, it was his life's goal, finally achieved in his grand design for the Analytical Engine. With Hollerith, it was an unconscious act rather than a dream or concept. He demonstrated what Babbage preached: human computing could be partitioned, sequenced, and then carried out by machines. But, it was Turing who found the grail: the Universal Turing Machine. In one blinding stroke, he fused the abstract and the concrete into a perfect union. He demonstrated and proved that computing theory and application are concordant. What follows are the reviews of three biographies in that century-long quest. Babbage frowns stiffly across a century at his computing descendents as if still unsatisfied with \u2026"

It is shown that the standard process in micro-physics is a generalised spectral analysis, whose properties are simply expressible in symbolic form by means of projective or \u201cidempotent\u201d operators (Einzeloperatoren). It appears that only two hypotheses need be made and that these relate to the existence and properties of transition probabilities. From these fundamental principles, which have a direct physical significance, it is possible to deduce the subsidiary principles which form the accepted basis of the mathematical analysis of the quantum theory and which deal with the representation of quantum states and physical quantities by vectors and linear operators respectively. In this paper the emphasis is laid on the experimental process determining a state of a system and on the associated operators rather than on the state itself or the vector representing it in the system space. Projective operators, which represent actual processes of measurement, and unitary operators, which represent actual transformations of systems of measurement, are given priority over the (statistical) operators which represent physical variables. This method of representation makes the physical meaning of the theory fundamental, instead of leaving it to be extracted from a purely mathematical system of non-commutative algebra or differential equations."

Each module (see Figure 4.24) could correspond to a different area of the human brain. How can we link this different areas of the brain? For example, 5 modules would be represented by 5 associative memories. From the 5 associative memories, we can compose a global associative memory by the arrangement on the diagonal. An associative memory of the dimension 30 evolves in which local feature addresses are translated into global feature addresses (see Figure 4.25). In this global context, connections between modules can be easily indicated by weights outside the modules, in the column of the first module and the row to the second module (connection from the first module to the second module). In Figure 4.25 we can see three connections between the modules corresponding to our rule base [Wichert (2012)]."

Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

The purpose of the present note is to outline an extension of this result to the engere Funktionenkalkul of Hilbert and Ackermann. In the author's cited paper it is pointed out that there can be associated recursively with every well-formed formula a recursive enumeration of the formulas into which it is convertible. This means the existence of a recursively defined function a of two positive integers such that, if y is the Godel representation of a well-formed formula Y then a(x, y) is the Godel representation of the x th formula in the enumeration of the formulas into which Y is convertible. Consider the system L of symbolic logic which arises from the engere Funktionenkalkul by adding to it: as additional undefined symbols, a symbol 1 for the number 1 (regarded as an individual), a symbol = for the propositional function = (equality of individuals), a symbol s for the arithmetic function x +1, a symbol a for the arithmetic function a described in the preceding paragraph, and symbols b 1 , b 2 , \u2026, b k for the auxiliary arithmetic functions which are employed in the recursive definition of a ; and as additional axioms, the recursion equations for the functions a , b 1 , b 2 , \u2026, b k (expressed with free individual variables, the class of individuals being taken as identical with the class of positive integers), and two axioms of equality, x = x , and x = y \u2192[F(x)\u2192F(y)] ."

This paper seeks to clarify the foundations of quantum mechanics. It presents a reformulation of quantum theory in a form believed suitable for application to general relativity. The aim is not to deny or contradict the conventional formulation of quantum theory, which has demonstrated its usefulness in an overwhelming variety of problems, but rather to supply a new, more general and complete formulation, from which the conventional interpretation can be deduced. The relationship of this new formulation to the older formulation is therefore that of a metatheory to a theory, that is, it is an underlying theory in which the nature and consistency, as well as the realm of applicability, of the older theory can be investigated and clarified."

Indem solche Wesen Messungen vornehmen, erzeugen sie ein Verhalten des Systems, welches es deutlich von einem sich selbst \u00fcberlassenen mechanischen System unterscheidet.

Zun\u00e4chst wird ganz universell diese Entropieerzeugung aus der Forderung errechnet, da\u00df sie im Sinne des zweiten Hauptsatzes eine volle Kompensation darstellt [Gleichung (1)]. Es wird dann auch an Hand einer unbelebten Vorrichtung, die aber (unter dauernder Entropieerzeugung) in der Lage ist, Messungen vorzunehmen, die entstehende Entropiemenge berechnet und gefunden, da\u00df sie gerade so gro\u00df ist, wie es f\u00fcr die volle Kompensation notwendig ist: die wirkliche Entropieerzeugung bei der Messung braucht also nicht gr\u00f6\u00dfer zu sein, als es Gleichung (1) verlangt."
