The analytical theory of the aberrations of axially symmetrical syste, s, on the other hand, has been in existance for a little more than a century. If one reflects that for the most part this comprises only the consequences of the application of Snell's law and elementary coordinate geometry to the very simple geometrical configuration of spherical surfaces with their centres in a straight line, it is remarkable that even here important work both continues and remains to be done."

This second paper is concerned with measuring the response of the visual system to sine-wave and square-wave spatial distributions using the threshold criterion of contrast sensitivity. Particular emphasis is placed on the low spatial frequencies, a region which is believed to be critically important in the mechanism of visual contrast phenomena. Results strongly imply interaction of two basic mechanisms in the visual system. These mechanisms may be characterized individually as a low-pass filter component (optical) and a high-pass filter component (neural, chemical, electrical, etc.)."

In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"
