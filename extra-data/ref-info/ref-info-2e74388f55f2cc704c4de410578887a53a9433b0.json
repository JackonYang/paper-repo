                "text": "Databases are increasingly being used to store multi-media objects such as maps, images, audio and video. Storage and retrieval of these objects is accomplished using multi-dimensional index structures such as R*-trees and SS-trees. As dimensionality increases, query performance in these index structures degrades. This phenomenon, generally referred to as the dimensionality curse, can be circumvented by reducing the dimensionality of the data. Such a reduction is however accompanied by a loss of precision of query results. Current techniques such as QBIC use SVD transform-based dimensionality reduction to ensure high query precision. The drawback of this approach is that SVD is expensive to compute, and therefore not readily applicable to dynamic databases. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for performing SVD-based dimensionality reduction in dynamic databases. When the data distribution changes considerably so as to degrade query precision, we recompute the SVD transform and incorporate it in the existing index structure. For recomputing the SVD-transform, we propose a novel technique that uses aggregate data from the existing index rather than the entire data. This technique reduces the SVD-computation time without compromising query precision. We then explore efficient ways to incorporate the recomputed SVD-transform in the existing index structure without degrading subsequent query response times. These techniques reduce the computation time by a factor of 20 in experiments on color and texture image vectors. The error due to approximate computation of SVD is less than 10%."

Unlike the specific case of vector spaces, where information on data distribution has been exploited to derive cost models for predicting the performance of multi-dimensional access methods, in a generic metric space there is no such a possibility, which makes the problem quite different and requires a novel approach. We insist that the distance distribution of objects can be profitably used to solve the problem, and consequently develop a concrete cost model for the M-tree access method [10]. Our results rely on the assumption that the indexed dataset comes from a metric space which is \u201chomogeneous\u201d enough (in a probabilistic sense) to allow reliable cost estimations even if the distance distribution with respect to a specific query object is unknown. We experimentally validate the model over both real and synthetic datasets, and show how the model can be used to tune the M-tree in order to minimize a combination of CPU and I/O costs. Finally, we sketch how the same approach can be applied to derive a cost model for the vp-tree index structure [8]."

However, the performance of these methods generally degrades as dimensionality increases. Although this phenomenon-known as the \u2018dimensional curse\u2019-is well known, little or no quantitative a.nalysis of the phenomenon is available. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of partitioning and clustering techniques for similarity search in HDVSs. We show formally that these methods exhibit linear complexity at high dimensionality, and that existing methods are outperformed on average by a simple sequential scan if the number of dimensions exceeds around 10. Consequently, we come up with an alternative organization based on approximations to make the unavoidable sequential scan as fast as possible. We describe a simple vector approximation scheme, called VA-file, and report on an experimental evaluation of this and of two tree-based index methods (an R*-tree and an X-tree)."

For example, new database applications such as data warehousing produce very large relations which require a multidimensional view on the data, and in areas such as multimedia and CAD a content-based search is essential which is often implemented using some kind of feature vectors. All the new applications have in common that the underlying database system has to support the processing of queries on large amounts of high-dimensional data. Now, we may ask what the difference is between processing lowand high-dimensional data. A result of recent research activities is that basically none of the querying and indexing techniques which provide good results on low-dimensional data also performs sufficiently well on higher-dimensional data. The problem of dealing with high-dimensional spaces has therefore been addressed in a variety of recent database research projects. The goal of the tutorial is to spread the knowledge about high-dimensional spaces and the proposed techniques to a large community of both, researchers and practitioners researchers who are interested in querying and indexing techniques for high-dimensional data, and practitioners who are interested in the state-of-the-art of database support for their applications."

However, any real implementation in commercial products requires solving the hard problem of determining \u201cHow much sampling is enough?\u201d We address this critical question in the context of equi-height histograms used in many commercial products, including Microsoft SQL Server. We introduce a conservative error metric capturing the intuition that for an approximate histogram to have low error, the error must be small in all regions of the histogram. We then present a result establishing an optimal bound on the amount of sampling required for pre-specified error bounds. We also describe an adaptive page sampling algorithm which achieves greater efficiency by using all values in a sampled page but adjusts the amount of sampling depending on clustering of values in pages. Next, we establish that the problem of estimating the number of distinct values is provably difficult, but propose a new error metric which has a reliable estimator and can still be exploited by query optimizers to influence the choice of execution plans. The algorithm for histogram construction was prototyped on Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and we present experimental results showing that the adaptive algorithm accurately approximates the true histogram over different data distributions."

One important task in query optimization is selectivity estimation, that is, given a query P, we need to estimate the fraction of records in the database that satisfy P. Many commercial database systems maintain histograms to approximate the frequency distribution of values in the attributes of relations.\nIn this paper, we present a technique based upon a multiresolution wavelet decomposition for building histograms on the underlying data distributions, with applications to databases, statistics, and simulation. Histograms built on the cumulative data distributions give very good approximations with limited space usage. We give fast algorithms for constructing histograms and using them in an on-line fashion for selectivity estimation. Our histograms also provide quick approximate answers to OLAP queries when the exact answers are not required. Our method captures the joint distribution of multiple attributes effectively, even when the attributes are correlated. Experiments confirm that our histograms offer substantial improvements in accuracy over random sampling and other previous approaches."

The <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>); deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with <italic>t</italic> keys specified [proven maximum running time of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that <italic>k</italic>-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given."

In particular, the well-known a-priori algorithm is only effective when the only rules of interest are relationships that occur very frequently. However, there are a number of applications, such as data mining, identification of similar Web documents, clustering and collaborative filtering, where the rules of interest have comparatively few instances in the data. In these cases, we must look for highly correlated items, or possibly even causal relationships between infrequent items. We develop a family of algorithms for solving this problem, employing a combination of random sampling and hashing techniques. We provide an analysis of the algorithms developed and conduct experiments on real and synthetic data to obtain a comparative performance analysis."

We use a local linear discriminant analysis to estimate an effective metric for computing neighborhoods. We determine the local decision boundaries from centroid information, and then shrink neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to these local decision boundaries, and elongate them parallel to the boundaries. Thereafter, any neighborhood-based classifier can be employed, using the modified neighborhoods. The posterior probabilities tend to be more homogeneous in the modified neighborhoods. We also propose a method for global dimension reduction, that combines local dimension information. In a number of examples, the methods demonstrate the potential for substantial improvements over nearest neighbour classification."

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\\ast} \\leq R \\leq R^{\\ast}(2 --MR^{\\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor."

                "text": "AbstractIn this paper we explore some implications of viewing graphs asgeometric objects. This approach offers a new perspective on a number of graph-theoretic and algorithmic problems. There are several ways to model graphs geometrically and our main concern here is with geometric representations that respect themetric of the (possibly weighted) graph. Given a graphG we map its vertices to a normed space in an attempt to (i) keep down the dimension of the host space, and (ii) guarantee a smalldistortion, i.e., make sure that distances between vertices inG closely match the distances between their geometric images.In this paper we develop efficient algorithms for embedding graphs low-dimensionally with a small distortion. Further algorithmic applications include:\u2022A simple, unified approach to a number of problems on multicommodity flows, including the Leighton-Rao Theorem [37] and some of its extensions. We solve an open question in this area, showing that the max-flow vs. min-cut gap in thek-commodities problem isO(logk). Our new deterministic polynomial-time algorithm finds a (nearly tight) cut meeting this bound.\u2022For graphs embeddable in low-dimensional spaces with a small distortion, we can find low-diameter decompositions (in the sense of [7] and [43]). The parameters of the decomposition depend only on the dimension and the distortion and not on the size of the graph.\u2022In graphs embedded this way, small balancedseparators can be found efficiently.\nGiven faithful low-dimensional representations of statistical data, it is possible to obtain meaningful and efficientclustering. This is one of the most basic tasks in pattern-recognition. For the (mostly heuristic) methods used in the practice of pattern-recognition, see [20], especially chapter 6.Our studies of multicommodity flows also imply that every embedding of (the metric of) ann-vertex, constant-degree expander into a Euclidean space (of any dimension) has distortion \u03a9(logn). This result is tight, and closes a gap left open by Bourgain [12]."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

QBIC allows queries on large image and video databases based on example images, user-constructed sketches and drawings, selected color and texture patterns, camera and object motion, and other graphical information. Two key properties of QBIC are (1) its use of image and video content-computable properties of color, texture, shape and motion of images, videos and their objects-in the queries, and (2) its graphical query language, in which queries are posed by drawing, selecting and other graphical means. This article describes the QBIC system and demonstrates its query capabilities. QBIC technology is part of several IBM products. >"

These tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually-significant coefficients. We describe three Photobook tools in particular: one that allows search based on grey-level appearance, one that uses 2D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties."
