                "text": "The task of visual classification is thce recognition of an object in the image as belonging to a general class of similar objects, such as a face, a car, a dog, and the like. This is a fundamental and natural task for biological visual systems, but it has proven difficult to perform visual classification by artificial computer vision systems. The main reason for this difficulty is the variability of shape within a class: different objects vary widely in appearance, and it is difficult to capture the essential shape features that characterize the members of one category and distinguish them from another, such as dogs from cats. \n \nIn this paper we describe an approach to classification using a fragment-based representation. In this approach, objects within a class are represented in terms of common image fragments that are used as building blocks for representing a large variety of different objects that belong to a common class. The fragments are selected from a training set of images based on a criterion of maximizing the mutual information of the fragments and the class they represent. For the purpose of classification the fragments are also organized into types, where each type is a collection of alternative fragments, such as different hairline or eye regions for face classification. During classification, the algorithm detects fragments of the different types, and then combines the evidence for the detected fragments to reach a final decision. Experiments indicate that it is possible to trade off the complexity of fragments with the complexity of the combination and decision stage, and this tradeoff is discussed. \n \nThe method is different from previous part-based methods in using class-specific object fragments of varying complexity, the method of selecting fragments, and the organization into fragment types. Experimental results of detecting face and car views show that the fragment-based approach can generalize well to a variety of novel image views within a class while maintaining low mis-classification error rates. We briefly discuss relationships between the proposed method and properties of parts of the primate visual system involved in object perception"

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

A statistical approach is developed where textures are modelled by the joint probability distribution of filter responses. This distribution is represented by the frequency histogram of filter response cluster centres (textons). Recognition proceeds from single, uncalibrated images and the novelty here is that rotationally invariant filters are used and the filter response space is low dimensional.Classification performance is compared with the filter banks and methods of Leung and Malik [IJCV, 2001], Schmid [CVPR, 2001] and Cula and Dana [IJCV, 2004] and it is demonstrated that superior performance is achieved here. Classification results are presented for all 61 materials in the Columbia-Utrecht texture database.We also discuss the effects of various parameters on our classification algorithm--such as the choice of filter bank and rotational invariance, the size of the texton dictionary as well as the number of training images used. Finally, we present a method of reliably measuring relative orientation co-occurrence statistics in a rotationally invariant manner, and discuss whether incorporating such information can enhance the classifier\u2019s performance."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

It is demonstrated that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of intensity values over extremely compact neighborhoods (starting from as small as 3 /spl times/ 3 pixels square), and that this outperforms classification using filter banks with large support. We develop a novel texton based representation, which is suited to modeling this joint neighborhood distribution for MRFs. The representation is learnt from training images, and then used to classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into texture classes. The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800 images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database. The classification performance surpasses that of recent state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik, Cula & Dana, and Varma & Zisserman."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Images of either individual or multiple textures are best described by distributions of spatial frequency descriptors, rather than single descriptor vectors over presegmented regions. A retrieval method based on the earth movers distance with an appropriate ground distance is shown to handle both complete and partial multi-textured queries. As an illustration, different images of the same type of animal are easily retrieved together. At the same time, animals with subtly different coats, like cheetahs and leopards, are properly distinguished."

To this end we extend the class of generative probabilistic models known as pictorial structures. This class of models is particularly suited to represent articulated structures, and has previously been used by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher for pose estimation of humans. We extend pictorial structures in three ways: (i) likelihoods are included for both the boundary and the enclosed texture of the animal; (ii) a complete graph is modelled (rather than a tree structure); (iii) it is demonstrated that the model can be tted in polynomial time using belief propagation. We show examples for two types of quadrupeds, cows and horses. We achieve excellent recognition performance for cows with an equal error rate of 3% for 500 positive and 5000 negative images."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

This freedom obliges users of these standards to choose the color space in which to represent their data. A device-independent interchange color space must exhibit an exact mapping to a colorimetric color representation, ability to encode all visible colors, compact representation for given accuracy, and low computational cost for transforms to and from device-dependent spaces. The performance of CIE 1931 XYZ, CIELUV, CIELAB, YES, CCIR 601-2 YCbCr, and SMPTE-C RGB is measured against these requirements. With extensions, all of these spaces can meet the first two requirements. Quantizing error dominates the representational errors of the tested color spaces. Spaces that offer low quantization error also have low gain for image noise. All linear spaces are less compact than nonlinear alternatives. The choice of nonlinearity is not critical; a wide range of gammas yields acceptable results. The choice of primaries for RGB representations is not critical, except that high-chroma primaries should be avoided. Quantizing the components of the candidate spaces with varying precision yields only small improvements. Compatibility with common image data compression techniques leads to the requirement for low luminance contamination, a property that compromises several otherwise acceptable spaces. The conversion of a device-independent representation to popular device spaces by means of trilinear interpolation requires substantially fewer lookup table entries with CCIR 601-2 YCbCr and CIELAB."

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it also requires specifying which features of $\\X$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\\X$ that preserves the maximum information about $\\Y$. That is, we squeeze the information that $\\X$ provides about $\\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords $\\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure $d(x,\\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\\X$ and $\\Y$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules $X \\to \\tX$ and $\\tX \\to \\Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere."

The Haar-Fisz transformation transforms a vector of binned Poisson counts to approximate normality with variance one. Hence we can use any suitable Gaussian wavelet shrinkage method to estimate the Poisson intensity. Since the Haar-Fisz operator does not commute with the shift operator we can dramatically improve accuracy by always cycle spinning before the Haar-Fisz transform as well as optionally after. Extensive simulations show that our approach usually significantly outperformed state-of-the-art competitors but was occasionally comparable. Our method is fast, simple, automatic, and easy to code. Our technique is applied to the estimation of the intensity of earthquakes in northern California. We show that our technique gives visually similar results to the current state-of-the-art."
