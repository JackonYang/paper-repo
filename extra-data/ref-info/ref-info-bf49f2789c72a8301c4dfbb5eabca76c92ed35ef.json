This is extremely challenging because of variation in pose, anatomy, clothing, and imaging conditions. Current methods use simple models of body part appearance and plausible configurations due to limitations of available training data and constraints on computational expense. We show that such models severely limit accuracy. Building on the successful pictorial structure model (PSM) we propose richer models of both appearance and pose, using state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers without introducing unacceptable computational expense. We introduce a new annotated database of challenging consumer images, an order of magnitude larger than currently available datasets, and demonstrate over 50% relative improvement in pose estimation accuracy over a stateof-the-art method."

While the fine-level state-space of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models, most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions, where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals. The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art."

In previous work the Pictorial Structure Model approach has proven particularly successful, and is appealing because of its moderate computational cost. However, the accuracy of resulting pose estimates has been limited by the use of simple representations of limb appearance. We propose strong discriminatively trained limb detectors combining gradient and color segmentation cues. Our main contribution is a novel method for capturing coherent appearance properties of a limb using efficient color segmentation applied to every limb hypothesis during inference. The approach gives state-of-the-art results improving significantly on the \u201citerative image parsing\u201d method, and shows significant promise for combination with other models of pose and appearance."

                "text": "Part-based tree-structured models have been widely used for 2D articulated human pose-estimation. These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model. These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence. Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion. To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model. We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods."

Numerous models have been proposed over the years and often address different special cases, such as pedestrian detection or upper body pose estimation in TV footage. This paper shows that such specialization may not be necessary, and proposes a generic approach based on the pictorial structures framework. We show that the right selection of components for both appearance and spatial modeling is crucial for general applicability and overall performance of the model. The appearance of body parts is modeled using densely sampled shape context descriptors and discriminatively trained AdaBoost classifiers. Furthermore, we interpret the normalized margin of each classifier as likelihood in a generative model. Non-Gaussian relationships between parts are represented as Gaussians in the coordinate system of the joint between parts. The marginal posterior of each part is inferred using belief propagation. We demonstrate that such a model is equally suitable for both detection and pose estimation tasks, outperforming the state of the art on three recently proposed datasets."

Pose accuracy is directly affected by the accuracy of the part detectors but more accurate detectors are likely to be also more computationally expensive. We propose to use multiple, heterogeneous part detectors with varying accuracy and computation requirements, ordered in a hierarchy, to achieve more accurate and efficient pose estimation. For inference, we propose an algorithm to localize articulated objects by exploiting an ordered hierarchy of detectors with increasing accuracy. The inference uses branch and bound method to search for each part and use kinematics from neighboring parts to guide the branching behavior and compute bounds on the best part estimate. We demonstrate our approach on a publicly available People dataset and outperform the state-of-art methods. Our inference is 3 times faster than one based on using a single, highly accurate detector."

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database."

While such models allow efficient learning and inference, they fail to capture additional dependencies between body parts, other than kinematic constraints between connected parts. In this paper, we consider the use of multiple tree models, rather than a single tree model for human pose estimation. Our model can alleviate the limitations of a single tree-structured model by combining information provided across different tree models. The parameters of each individual tree model are trained via standard learning algorithms in a single tree-structured model. Different tree models can be combined in a discriminative fashion by a boosting procedure. We present experimental results showing the improvement of our approaches on two different datasets. On the first dataset, we use our multiple tree framework for occlusion reasoning. On the second dataset, we combine multiple deformable trees for capturing spatial constraints between non-connected body parts."

Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching."

To achieve tractability, the structure and parameterization of the model is often restricted, for example, by assuming tree dependency structure and unimodal, data-independent pairwise interactions. These expressivity restrictions fail to capture important patterns in the data. On the other hand, local methods such as nearest-neighbor classification and kernel density estimation provide non-parametric flexibility but require large amounts of data to generalize well. We propose a simple semi-parametric approach that combines the tractability of pictorial structure inference with the flexibility of non-parametric methods by expressing a subset of model parameters as kernel regression estimates from a learned sparse set of exemplars. This yields query-specific, image-dependent pose priors. We develop an effective shape-based kernel for upper-body pose similarity and propose a leave-one-out loss function for learning a sparse subset of exemplars for kernel regression. We apply our techniques to two challenging datasets of human figure parsing and advance the state-of-the-art (from 80% to 86% on the Buffy dataset [8]), while using only 15% of the training data as exemplars."

We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use by other researchers."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

This problem is challenging due to the high dimensional state space of body poses, the presence of pose ambiguity, and the need to segment the human body in an image. We use an image generative approach by modeling the human kinematics, the shape and the clothing probabilistically. These models are used for deriving a good likelihood measure to evaluate samples in the solution, space. We adopt a data-driven MCMC framework for searching the solution space efficiently. Our observation data include the face, head-shoulders contour, skin color blobs, and ridges; and they provide evidences on the positions of the head, shoulders and limbs. To translate these inferences into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of 'proposal maps', which is an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates during the MCMC search. As experimental results show, the proposed technique estimates the human 3D pose accurately on various test images."

Because humans are highly articulated, the range of deformations they undergo makes this task extremely challenging. Previous methods have focused largely on heuristics or pairwise part models in approaching this problem. We propose a bottom-up parsing of increasingly more complete partial body masks guided by a parse tree. At each level of the parsing process, we evaluate the partial body masks directly via shape matching with exemplars, without regard to how the parses are formed. The body is evaluated as a whole, not the sum of its constituent parses, unlike previous approaches. Multiple image segmentations are included at each of the levels of the parsing, to augment existing parses or to introduce ones. Our method yields both a pose estimate as well as a segmentation of the human. We demonstrate competitive results on this challenging task with relatively few training examples on a dataset of baseball players with wide pose variation. Our method is comparatively simple and could be easily extended to other objects."

                "text": "Tree structured models have been widely used for determining the pose of a human body, from either 2D or 3D data. While such models can effectively represent the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure, they do not capture additional constraints such as coordination of the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss an important source of information about human body pose, as limb coordination is necessary for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being evident in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this paper, we consider the use of undirected graphical models that augment a tree structure with latent variables in order to account for coordination between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor models, since they are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional correlations in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree structure. These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure and thus a variant of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can be applied for efficient estimation. We present some experimental results contrasting common-factor models with tree models, and quantify the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data."

We show how this seemingly difficult problem can be solved by (i) reducing it to an equivalent convex problem with a small, polynomial number of constraints (taking advantage of the fact that the model is tree-structured and the potentials have a special form); and (ii) obtaining the globally optimal model using an efficient dual decomposition strategy. Each component of the dual decomposition is solved by a modified version of the highly optimized SVM-Light algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we learn human upper body models using two challenging, publicly available datasets. Our model accounts for the articulation of humans as well as the occlusion of parts. We compare our method with a baseline iterative strategy as well as a state of the art algorithm and show significant efficiency improvements."

The approach that we take is to use segmentation to guide our recognition algorithm to salient bits of the image.

Typically, one fits a model by maximizing the likelihood of the part labels. Alternatively, one could fit a model such that, when the model is run on the training images, it finds the parts. We do this by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the training data. We formulate model-learning as parameter estimation in a conditional random field (CRF). Initializing parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates, we reach the global optimum by gradient ascent. We present a learning algorithm that searches exhaustively over all part locations in an image without relying on feature detectors. This provides millions of examples of training data, and seems to avoid over-fitting issues known with CRFs. Results for part localization are relatively scarce in the community. We present results on three established datasets; Caltech motorbikes [8], USC people [19], and Weizmann horses [3]. In the Caltech set we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art [6]. For the challenging people dataset, we present results that are comparable to [19], but are obtained using a significantly more generic model (devoid of a face or skin detector). Our model is general enough to find other articulated objects; we use it to recover poses of horses in the challenging Weizmann database."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Our method uses an approximate search for inference, and an approximate structure learning method to learn. We compare our method to state of the art methods on our dataset (which depicts a wide range of poses), on the standard Buffy dataset, and on the reduced PASCAL dataset published recently. Our results suggest that the Buffy dataset over emphasizes poses where the arms hang down, and that leads to generalization problems."

We used a K-mean plus Nearest Neighbor classifier to validate our approach, mostly because it was simple to implement. It has proved effective but still too slow for real-time use. In this paper, we advocate instead the use of randomized trees as the classification technique. It is both fast enough for real-time performance and more robust. It also gives us a principled way not only to match keypoints but to select during a training phase those that are the most recognizable ones. This results in a real-time system able to detect and position in 3D planar, non-planar, and even deformable objects. It is robust to illuminations changes, scale changes and occlusions."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Its advantages include improved classification performance, accurate detection and localization of object parts and sub-parts, and explicitly identifying the different appearances of each object part. The semantic hierarchy algorithm starts by constructing a minimal feature hierarchy and proceeds by adding semantically equivalent representatives to each node, using the entire hierarchy as a context for determining the identity and locations of added features. Part detection is obtained by a bottom-up top-down cycle. Unlike previous approaches, the semantic hierarchy learns to represent the set of possible appearances of object parts at all levels, and their statistical dependencies. The algorithm is fully automatic and is shown experimentally to substantially improve the recognition of objects and their parts."

This leads to a need for approximate training methods. Unfortunately, knowledge about how to perform efficient and effective approximate training is limited. Focusing on structural SVMs, we provide and explore algorithms for two different classes of approximate training algorithms, which we call undergenerating (e.g., greedy) and overgenerating (e.g., relaxations) algorithms. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of both types of approximate trained structural SVMs, focusing on fully connected pairwise Markov random fields.

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse.

In this paper, we describe an algorithm for following ill-structured roads in which dominant texture orientations computed with multi-scale Gabor wavelet filters vote for a consensus road vanishing point location. In-plane road curvature and out-of-plane undulation are estimated in each image by tracking the vanishing point indicated by a horizontal image strip as it moves up toward the putative vanishing line. Particle filtering is also used to track the vanishing point sequence induced by road curvature from image to image. Results are shown for vanishing point localization on a variety of road scenes ranging from gravel roads to dirt trails to highways."

This is computationally challenging because the time complexity scales exponentially in the size of the largest clique in the graph. The proposed algorithm uses Branch and Bound (BB) to search for the globally optimal solution. The algorithm converges rapidly in practice and this is due to a novel method for quickly computing tree based lower bounds. The key idea is to recycle the dynamic programming (DP) tables associated with the tree model to look up the tree based lower bound rather than recomputing the lower bound from scratch. This technique is further sped up using Range Minimum Query data structures to provide O(1) cost for computing the lower bound for most iterations of the BB algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on the Iterative Parsing dataset and it is shown to run fast empirically."
