It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "If a scene containing fine spatial detail is viewed at constant high photopic luminance, there are two main factors which limit the perception of the fine detail-the quality of the optics of the eye forming the image on the retina and the ability of the retina (coupled to the brain) to resolve the details of that image. In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"
