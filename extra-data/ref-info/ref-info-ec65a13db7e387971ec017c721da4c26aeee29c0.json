Previous approaches rely on hand-crafted features for capturing structural information. In contrast, we propose to learn features from raw image pixels using CNN. The use of CNN is motivated by the the hierarchical nature of document layout. Equipped with rectified linear units and trained with dropout, our CNN performs well even when document layouts present large inner-class variations. Experiments on public challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.

The proposed method is based on statistics of patch-codewords over different regions of image. We begin with a set of wanted and a random set of unwanted images representative of a large heterogeneous collection. We then use raw-image patches extracted from the unlabeled images to learn a codebook. To model the spatial relationships between patches, the image is recursively partitioned horizontally and vertically, and a histogram of patch-codewords is computed in each partition. The resulting set of features give a high precision and recall for the retrieval of hand-drawn and machine-print table-documents, and unconstrained mixed form-type documents, when trained using a random forest classifier. We compare our method to the spatial-pyramid method, and show that the proposed approach for learning layout characteristics is competitive for document images."

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia."

The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

There has been relatively little work in this area for document images, which are typically text-intensive and contain a mixture of layout, text-based, and image features. Beyond simple partitioning, the problem of clustering related page images is also important, especially for information retrieval problems such as document image searching and browsing. Motivated by this, we describe a model for estimating inter-page similarity in ordered collections of document images, based on a combination of text and layout features. The features are used as input to a discriminative classifier, whose output is used in a constrained clustering criterion. We do a task-based evaluation of our method by applying it the problem of automatic document separation during batch scanning. Using layout and page numbering features, our algorithm achieved a separation accuracy of 95.6% on the test collection."

Our method is robust to diverse training data size, image formats and qualities. Through matching the feature points, image registration is available for the query image as well. Although we aimed for the large domain of the structured document images, our method already achieved zero error rates in the tests on the benchmark NIST tax form databases."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

As it belongs to the wavelet family, this representation can be useful at several scales of details. The proposed scheme for handwritten shape characterization targets to detect oriented and curved fragments at different scales so as to compose an unique signature for each handwritten analyzed samples. In this way, curvelets coefficients are used as a representation tool for handwriting when searching in large manuscripts databases by finding similar handwritten samples. Current results of ancient manuscripts retrieval are very promising with very satisfying precisions and recalls."

Document genre is determined from the layout structure detected from scanned binary images of the document pages, using no OCR results and minimal a priori knowledge of document logical structures. Our approach uses attributed relational graphs (ARGs) to represent the layout structure of document instances, and a first order random graphs (FORGs) to represent document genres. In this paper we develop our FORG-based genre classification method and present a comparative evaluation between our technique and a variety of statistical pattern classifiers. FORGs are capable of modeling common layout structure within a document genre and are shown to outperform traditional pattern classification techniques when fine-grained genre distinctions must be drawn."

We define structural similarity, and discuss the benefits of using it as a complement to content similarity for querying document image databases. We present an approach to computing a geometrically invariant structural similarity, and use this measure to search document image databases. Our approach supports both full image matching using query by example (QBE) and sub-image matching using query by sketch (QBS). The similarity measure considers spatial and layout structure, and is computed by aggregating content area overlap measures with respect to their underlying column structures. These techniques are tested within the Intelligent Document Image Retrieval (IDIR) System, and results demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency of structure queries with respect to human relevance judgments are presented."
