To evaluate the performance of recent algorithms in detecting and recognizing text from complex images, the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition was organized. Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance."

With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems."

For this we used the same data as the ICDAR 2003 competition, which has been kept private until now. This allows a direct comparison with the 2003 entries. The main result is that the leading 2005 entry has improved significantly on the leading 2003 entry, with an increase in average f-score from 0.5 to 0.62, where the f-score is the same adapted information retrieval measure used for the 2003 competition. The paper also discusses the Web-based deployment and evaluation of text locating systems, and one of the leading entries has now been deployed in this way. This mode of usage could lead to more complete and more immediate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each newly developed system."

With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

The domain of colour text image analysis (real scenes, Web and spam images, scanned colour documents) has traditionally suffered from a lack of a comprehensive performance evaluation framework. Such a framework is extremely difficult to specify, and corresponding pixel-level accurate information tedious to define. In this paper we discuss the challenges and technical issues associated with developing such a framework. Then, we describe a complete framework for the evaluation of text extraction methods at multiple levels, provide a detailed ground-truth specification and present a case study on how this framework can be used in a real-life situation."

This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

The method runs in real time and achieves state-of-the-art text localization results on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading dataset.

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Human perception of text, on the other hand, is based on perceptual organisation through which text emerges as a perceptually significant group of atomic objects. Therefore humans are able to detect text even in languages and scripts never seen before. In this paper, we argue that the text extraction problem could be posed as the detection of meaningful groups of regions. We present a method built around a perceptual organisation framework that exploits collaboration of proximity and similarity laws to create text-group hypotheses. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive with state of the art approaches on a standard dataset covering text in variable orientations and two languages."

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008\u20132012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community\u2019s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges."

Image acquisition introduces distortion in terms of perspective, blurring, illumination, and characters which may have very different shape, size, and color. We introduce in this article a full text detection scheme. Our architecture is based on a new process to combine a hypothesis generation step to get potential boxes of text and a hypothesis validation step to filter false detections. The hypothesis generation process relies on a new efficient segmentation method based on a morphological operator. Regions are then filtered and classified using shape descriptors based on Fourier, Pseudo Zernike moments and an original polar descriptor, which is invariant to rotation. Classification process relies on three SVM classifiers combined in a late fusion scheme. Detected characters are finally grouped to generate our text box hypotheses. Validation step is based on a global SVM classification of the box content using dedicated descriptors adapted from the HOG approach. Results on the well-known ICDAR database are reported showing that our method is competitive. Evaluation protocol and metrics are deeply discussed and results on a very challenging street-level database are also proposed."

However, recent research demonstrates that a conventional shape-based OCR engine would be able to produce competitive results in the end-to-end scene text recognition task when provided with a conveniently preprocessed image. In this paper we confirm this finding with a set of experiments where two off-the-shelf OCR engines are combined with an open implementation of a state-of-the-art scene text detection framework. The obtained results demonstrate that in such pipeline, conventional OCR solutions still perform competitively compared to other solutions specifically designed for scene text recognition."

We split the word image into individual colour, gray and lightness planes and enhance the contrast of each of these planes independently by a power-law transform. The discrimination factor of each plane is computed as the maximum between-class variance used in Otsu thresholding. The plane that has maximum discrimination factor is selected for segmentation. The trial version of Omnipage OCR is then used on the binarized words for recognition. Our recognition results on ICDAR 2011 and ICDAR 2003 word datasets are compared with those reported in the literature. As baseline, the images binarized by simple global and local thresholding techniques were also recognized. The word recognition rate obtained by our non-linear enhancement and selection of plance method is 72.8% and 66.2% for ICDAR 2011 and 2003 word datasets, respectively. We have created ground-truth for each image at the pixel level to benchmark these datasets using a toolkit developed by us. The recognition rate of benchmarked images is 86.7% and 83.9% for ICDAR 2011 and 2003 datasets, respectively."

Our approach combines local likelihood and pairwise positional consistency priors with higher order priors that enforce consistency of characters (lexicon) and their attributes (font and colour). Unlike traditional stage-based methods, word recognition in our framework is performed by estimating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution under the joint posterior distribution of the model. MAP inference in our model is performed through the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). We show how the efficiency of certain operations on WFSTs can be utilized to find the most likely word under the model in an efficient manner. We evaluate our method on a range of challenging datasets (ICDAR'03, SVT, ICDAR'11). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cropped word recognition."

While traditional document processing often faces challenges such as unusual fonts, noise, and unconstrained lexicons, scene text reading amplifies these challenges and introduces new ones such as motion blur, curved layouts, perspective projection, and occlusion among others. Reading scene text is a complex problem involving many details that must be handled effectively for robust, accurate results. In this work, we describe and evaluate a reading system that combines several pieces, using probabilistic methods for coarsely binarizing a given text region, identifying baselines, and jointly performing word and character segmentation during the recognition process. By using scene context to recognize several words together in a line of text, our system gives state-of-the-art performance on three difficult benchmark data sets."

In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust method for detecting texts in natural scene images. A fast and effective pruning algorithm is designed to extract Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) as character candidates using the strategy of minimizing regularized variations. Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and clustering threshold are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm. The posterior probabilities of text candidates corresponding to non-text are estimated with a character classifier; text candidates with high non-text probabilities are eliminated and texts are identified with a text classifier. The proposed system is evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition database; the f-measure is over 76%, much better than the state-of-the-art performance of 71%. Experiments on multilingual, street view, multi-orientation and even born-digital databases also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Experimental results obtained with several challenging datasets show the good performance of the proposed method, which has been demonstrated to be more robust than using multi-scale computation or sliding windows."

In this paper, we propose a novel scene text recognition method using part-based tree-structured character detection. Different from conventional multi-scale sliding window character detection strategy, which does not make use of the character-specific structure information, we use part-based tree-structure to model each type of character so as to detect and recognize the characters at the same time. While for word recognition, we build a Conditional Random Field model on the potential character locations to incorporate the detection scores, spatial constraints and linguistic knowledge into one framework. The final word recognition result is obtained by minimizing the cost function defined on the random field. Experimental results on a range of challenging public datasets (ICDAR 2003, ICDAR 2011, SVT) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly both for character detection and word recognition."

As a result, the recognition results reported on the scenic word image datasets of ICDAR have been low. We introduce a novel technique, where we choose the middle row of the image as a sub-image and segment it first. Then, the labels from this segmented sub-image are used to propagate labels to other pixels in the image. This approach, which is unique and distinct from the existing methods, results in improved segmentation. Bayesian classification and Max-flow methods have been independently used for label propagation. This midline based approach limits the impact of degradations that happens to the image. The segmented text image is recognized using the trial version of Omnipage OCR. We have tested our method on ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2011 datasets. Our word recognition results of 64.5% and 71.6% are better than those of methods in the literature and also methods that competed in the Robust reading competition. Our method makes an implicit assumption that degradation is not present in the middle row."

Automatic recognition of text from web images plays an important role on extraction and retrieval of web information. However, the web images are usually in low resolution with artifacts and special effects, which makes word recognition a challenge task even after the text has been localized. In this paper, we propose a robust text recognition technique to efficiently convert the web images into text format. The proposed technique first makes use of the L0 norm smoothing to increase the edge contrast of the input web images. The images are then binarized on each color channel. A connected component analysis is followed to identify the possible character components. Finally the character candidates are recognized by the OCR engine after skew correction. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the latest ICDAR 2011 robust reading competition dataset for born-digital text. The experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed technique."

Gradient local correlation is insensitive to the gradient direction and robust to noise, small character size and shadow. Based on the text confidence map, the regions with high confidence are segmented into connected components (CCs), which are classified to text CCs and non-text CCs using an SVM classifier. Then, the text CCs with similar color and stroke width are grouped into text lines, which are in turn partitioned into words. Experimental results on the ICDAR 2003 text locating competition dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

The efficiency of the method is illustrated and the method is compared, according to various criteria, with common methods issued from the state of the art. This comparison shows that our method gives better results and is faster than the state of the art methods. Our method reduces also the number of segmented regions. This can lead to time saving in a complete scheme (executing time of multiple processing steps usually depends on the number of regions) and proves that our algorithm is more relevant."

We introduce a novel method of power-law transformation on the word image for binarization. We show the improvement in image binarization and the consequent increase in the recognition performance of OCR engine on the word image. The optimal value of gamma for a word image is automatically chosen by our algorithm with fixed stroke width threshold. We have exhaustively experimented our algorithm by varying the gamma and stroke width threshold value. By varying the gamma value, we found that our algorithm performed better than the results reported in the literature. On the ICDAR Robust Reading Systems Challenge-1: Word Recognition Task on born digital dataset, as compared to the recognition rate of 61.5% achieved by TH-OCR after suitable pre-processing by Yang et. al. and 63.4% by ABBYY Fine Reader (used as baseline by the competition organizers without any preprocessing), we achieved 82.9% using Omnipage OCR applied on the images after being processed by our algorithm."

Therefore, video text can be used as a valuable source for automated video indexing in digital video libraries. In this paper, we propose a workflow for video text detection and recognition. In the text detection stage, we have developed a fast localization-verification scheme, in which an edge-based multi-scale text detector first identifies potential text candidates with high recall rate. Then, detected candidate text lines are refined by using an image entropy-based filter. Finally, Stroke Width Transform (SWT)- and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based verification procedures are applied to eliminate the false alarms. For text recognition, we have developed a novel skeleton-based binarization method in order to separate text from complex backgrounds to make it processible for standard OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. Operability and accuracy of proposed text detection and binarization methods have been evaluated by using publicly available test data sets."

To be precise, we extract connected components (CCs) in images by using the maximally stable extremal region algorithm. These extracted CCs are partitioned into clusters so that we can generate candidate regions. Unlike conventional methods relying on heuristic rules in clustering, we train an AdaBoost classifier that determines the adjacency relationship and cluster CCs by using their pairwise relations. Then we normalize candidate word regions and determine whether each region contains text or not. Since the scale, skew, and color of each candidate can be estimated from CCs, we develop a text/nontext classifier for normalized images. This classifier is based on multilayer perceptrons and we can control recall and precision rates with a single free parameter. Finally, we extend our approach to exploit multichannel information. Experimental results on ICDAR 2005 and 2011 robust reading competition datasets show that our method yields the state-of-the-art performance both in speed and accuracy."

                "text": "Text detection in natural scene images is an important prerequisite for many content-based image analysis tasks, while most current research efforts only focus on horizontal or near horizontal scene text. In this paper, first we present a unified distance metric learning framework for adaptive hierarchical clustering, which can simultaneously learn similarity weights (to adaptively combine different feature similarities) and the clustering threshold (to automatically determine the number of clusters). Then, we propose an effective multi-orientation scene text detection system, which constructs text candidates by grouping characters based on this adaptive clustering. Our text candidates construction method consists of several sequential coarse-to-fine grouping steps: morphology-based grouping via single-link clustering, orientation-based grouping via divisive hierarchical clustering, and projection-based grouping also via divisive clustering. The effectiveness of our proposed system is evaluated on several public scene text databases, e.g., ICDAR Robust Reading Competition data sets (2011 and 2013), MSRA-TD500 and NEOCR. Specifically, on the multi-orientation text data set MSRA-TD500, the <inline-formula><tex-math>$f$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq1-2388210.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> measure of our system is <inline-formula><tex-math>$71$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"yin-ieq2-2388210.gif\"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> percent, much better than the state-of-the-art performance. We also construct and release a practical challenging multi-orientation scene text data set (USTB-SV1K), which is available at http://prir.ustb.edu.cn/TexStar/MOMV-text-detection/."

Under the general integrated segmentation-and-recognition framework with character oversegmentation, we investigate three important issues: candidate path evaluation, path search, and parameter estimation. For path evaluation, we combine multiple contexts (character recognition scores, geometric and linguistic contexts) from the Bayesian decision view, and convert the classifier outputs to posterior probabilities via confidence transformation. In path search, we use a refined beam search algorithm to improve the search efficiency and, meanwhile, use a candidate character augmentation strategy to improve the recognition accuracy. The combining weights of the path evaluation function are optimized by supervised learning using a Maximum Character Accuracy criterion. We evaluated the recognition performance on a Chinese handwriting database CASIA-HWDB, which contains nearly four million character samples of 7,356 classes and 5,091 pages of unconstrained handwritten texts. The experimental results show that confidence transformation and combining multiple contexts improve the text line recognition performance significantly. On a test set of 1,015 handwritten pages, the proposed approach achieved character-level accurate rate of 90.75 percent and correct rate of 91.39 percent, which are superior by far to the best results reported in the literature."

Binarization and edge detection are separately carried out on the three colour planes of the image. Connected components (CC's) obtained from the binarized image are thresholded based on their area and aspect ratio. CC's which contain sufficient edge pixels are retained. A novel approach is presented, where the text components are represented as nodes of a graph. Nodes correspond to the centroids of the individual CC's. Long edges are broken from the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Pair wise height ratio is also used to remove likely non-text components. A new minimum spanning tree is created from the remaining nodes. Horizontal grouping is performed on the CC's to generate bounding boxes of text strings. Overlapping bounding boxes are removed using an overlap area threshold. Non-overlapping and minimally overlapping bounding boxes are used for text segmentation. Vertical splitting is applied to generate bounding boxes at the word level. The proposed method is applied on all the images of the test dataset and values of precision, recall and H-mean are obtained using different approaches."

These resources provide both consumers and developers of technology with a common framework to objectively compare the performance of different algorithms and algorithmic improvements. In this paper, we present such a framework for evaluating object detection and tracking in video: specifically for face, text, and vehicle objects. This framework includes the source video data, ground-truth annotations (along with guidelines for annotation), performance metrics, evaluation protocols, and tools including scoring software and baseline algorithms. For each detection and tracking task and supported domain, we developed a 50-clip training set and a 50-clip test set. Each data clip is approximately 2.5 minutes long and has been completely spatially/temporally annotated at the I-frame level. Each task/domain, therefore, has an associated annotated corpus of approximately 450,000 frames. The scope of such annotation is unprecedented and was designed to begin to support the necessary quantities of data for robust machine learning approaches, as well as a statistically significant comparison of the performance of algorithms. The goal of this work was to systematically address the challenges of object detection and tracking through a common evaluation framework that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques, encourages the incorporation of objective evaluation into the development process, and contributes useful lasting resources of a scale and magnitude that will prove to be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come."

Here, we present a novel multi-strategy tracking based text detection approach in scene videos. In this approach, a state-of-the-art scene text detection module [1] is first used to detect text in each video frame. Then a multi-strategy text tracking technique is proposed, which uses tracking by detection, spatio-temporal context learning, and linear prediction to predict the candidate text location sequentially, and adaptively integrates and selects the best matching text block from the candidate blocks with a rule-based method. This multi-strategy tracking technique can combine the advantages of the three different tracking techniques and afterwards make remedies to the disadvantages of them. Experiments on a variety of scene videos show that our proposed approach is effective and robust to reduce false alarm and improve the accuracy of detection."

The address phrases are recognized as a whole because there is no extra space between words. The lexicon contains 111,349 address phrases, which are stored in a trie structure. In recognition, the text line image is matched with the lexicon entries (phrases) to obtain reliable segmentation and retrieve valid address phrases. The paper first introduces some effective techniques for text line image preprocessing and presegmentation. In presegmentation, the text line image is separated into primitive segments by connected component analysis and touching pattern splitting based on contour shape analysis. In lexicon matching, consecutive segments are dynamically combined into candidate character patterns. An accurate character classifier is embedded in lexicon matching to select characters matched with a candidate pattern from a dynamic category set. A beam search strategy is used to control the lexicon matching so as to achieve real-time recognition. In experiments on 3,589 live mail images, the proposed method achieved correct rate of 83.68 percent while the error rate is less than 1 percent."

The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures.In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition."

Recently, there has been a growing interest in organizing systematic evaluations to compare the various techniques. Unfortunately, the lack of common metrics for measuring the performance of multiple object trackers still makes it hard to compare their results. In this work, we introduce two intuitive and general metrics to allow for objective comparison of tracker characteristics, focusing on their precision in estimating object locations, their accuracy in recognizing object configurations and their ability to consistently label objects over time. These metrics have been extensively used in two large-scale international evaluations, the 2006 and 2007 CLEAR evaluations, to measure and compare the performance of multiple object trackers for a wide variety of tracking tasks. Selected performance results are presented and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented metrics are discussed based on the experience gained during the evaluations."

The advantages are increased capture, and improved participation in the event itself. However, passive capture also presents many new challenges. One key challenge is how to deal with the increased volume of media for retrieval, browsing, and organizing. This paper describes the SenseCam device, which combines a camera with a number of sensors in a pendant worn around the neck.

They are trained online with samples collected during tracking. Unfortunately, the potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden, which directly conflicts with real-time requirements. On the other hand, limiting the samples may sacrifice performance. \n \nInterestingly, we observed that, as we add more and more samples, the problem acquires circulant structure. Using the well-established theory of Circulant matrices, we provide a link to Fourier analysis that opens up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the Fast Fourier Transform. This can be done in the dual space of kernel machines as fast as with linear classifiers. We derive closed-form solutions for training and detection with several types of kernels, including the popular Gaussian and polynomial kernels. The resulting tracker achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art, can be implemented with only a few lines of code and runs at hundreds of frames-per-second. MATLAB code is provided in the paper (see Algorithm 1)."

After approximating a graph with a spanning tree, we develop a linear-time algorithm to label the tree such that the cut size of the tree is minimized. This significantly improves typical graph-based methods, which either have a cubic time complexity (for a dense graph) or $O(kn^2)$ (for a sparse graph with $k$ denoting the node degree). %In addition to its great scalability on large data, our proposed algorithm demonstrates high robustness and accuracy. In particular, on a graph with 400,000 nodes (in which 10,000 nodes are labeled) and 10,455,545 edges, our algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of $99.6\\%$ but takes less than $10$ seconds to label all the unlabeled data. Furthermore, our method shows great robustness to the graph construction both theoretically and empirically, this overcomes another big problem of traditional graph-based methods. In addition to its good scalability and robustness, the proposed algorithm demonstrates high accuracy. In particular, on a graph with $400,000$ nodes (in which $10,000$ nodes are labeled) and $10,455,545$ edges, our algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of $99.6\\%$ but takes less than $10$ seconds to label all the unlabeled data."
