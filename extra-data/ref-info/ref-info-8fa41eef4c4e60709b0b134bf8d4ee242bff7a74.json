We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of \"generic\" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the \"generic\" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of \"spatial-frequency\" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture \"texture-like\" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for \"textured\" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds.

The appropriate choice of type and level of description is of course task dependent, yet it is generally accepted that the low-level or so called early vision layers in the Human Visual System are context independent.This paper concentrates on the use of low-level approaches for solving computer vision problems and discusses three inter-related aspects of this: saliency; scale selection and content description. In contrast to many previous approaches which separate these tasks, we argue that these three aspects are intrinsically related. Based on this observation, a multiscale algorithm for the selection of salient regions of an image is introduced and its application to matching type problems such as tracking, object recognition and image retrieval is demonstrated."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

Over short times scales, it enables the integration of information from successive queries assuring faster convergence to the desired target images. Over long time scales (retrieval sessions) it allows the retrieval system to tailor itself to the preferences of particular users. We address the issue of learning by formulating retrieval as a problem of Bayesian inference. The new formulation is shown to have various advantages over previous approaches: it leads to the minimization of the probability of retrieval error, enables region-based queries without prior image segmentation, and suggests elegant procedures for combining multiple user specifications. As a consequence of all this, it enables the design of short and long-term learning mechanisms that are simple, intuitive, and extremely efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements. We introduce two such algorithms and present experimental evidence illustrating the clear advantages of learning for CBIR."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval, a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color, shape, or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition, cancer cell detection, etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact, semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics. In practice, the design of such primitives is non-trivial, and is driven by a number of conflicting real-world constraints (e.g. computation time vs. accuracy). The virage engine provides an open framework for developers to 'plug-in' primitives to solve specific image management problems. The architecture has been designed to support both static images and video in a unified paradigm. The infrastructure provided by the Virage engine can be utilized to address high-level problems as well, such as automatic, unsupervised keyword assignment, or image classification."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

Google\u2019s search engine works based on text retrieval: The images are not indexed by their appearance but by text which can be found in the context of the image. To achieve enhancements for the user we propose to reorder the images using a combination of methods from computer vision and data mining. We use features invariant against translation and rotation to represent the image content and the k-means and LBG cluster algorithms to present the images in groups in a more convenient way to the user. To test this method we created a new database from Google image search results."

The advantages of this shape description include simple model acquisition (direct from images), no need for camera calibration or object pose computation, and the use of index functions. We describe the feature construction and recognition algorithms in detail and provide an analysis of the combinatorial advantages of using index functions. Index functions are used to select models from a model base and are constructed from projective invariants based on algebraic curves and a canonical projective coordinate frame. Examples are given of object recognition from images of real scenes, with extensive object libraries. Successful recognition is demonstrated despite partial occlusion by unmodelled objects, and realistic lighting conditions."

It is based on growing image parts by minimizing theoretical bounds on the error probability of an SVM. Component-based face classifiers are then combined in a second stage to yield a hierarchical SVM classifier. Experimental results in face classification show considerable robustness against rotations in depth and suggest performance at significantly better level than other face detection systems. Novel aspects of our approach are: a) an algorithm to learn component-based classification experts and their combination, b) the use of 3-D morphable models for training, and c) a maximum operation on the output of each component classifier which may be relevant for biological models of visual recognition."

Surprisingly, little quantitative modeling has been done to explore the biological feasibility of this class of models to explain aspects of higher-level visual processing such as object recognition. We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions. The model is based on a MAX-like operation applied to inputs to certain cortical neurons that may have a general role in cortical function."

However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

Relevance feedback interactively determinines a user's desired output or query concept by asking the user whether certain proposed images are relevant or not. For a relevance feedback algorithm to be effective, it must grasp a user's query concept accurately and quickly, while also only asking the user to label a small number of images. We propose the use of a support vector machine active learning algorithm for conducting effective relevance feedback for image retrieval. The algorithm selects the most informative images to query a user and quickly learns a boundary that separates the images that satisfy the user's query concept from the rest of the dataset. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback."

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Examples include principal component analysis (as used for instance in 'eigen-faces'), independent component analysis, and auto-encoder neural networks. Such methods suffer from a number of restrictions such as the limitation to linear manifolds or the absence of a probablistic representation. In this paper we exploit recent developments in the fields of variational inference and latent variable models to develop a novel and tractable probabilistic approach to modelling manifolds which can handle complex non-linearities. Our framework comprises a mixture of sub-space components in which both the number of components and the effective dimensionality of the subspaces are determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. We illustrate our approach using two classical problems: modelling the manifold of face images and modelling the manifolds of hand-written digits."
