                "text": "The time course of the response of a single cortical neuron to counterphase-grating stimulation may vary as a function of stimulation parameters, as shown in the preceding paper (19). The poststimulus-time histograms of the response amplitudes against time are single or double peaked, and where double peaked, the two peaks are of equal or unequal amplitudes. Furthermore, the spatial-phase dependence of cortical complex-cell responses may be a function of spatial frequency, so that the receptive field appears to have linear spatial summation at some spatial frequencies and nonlinear spatial summation at others (19). In the first part of this paper, we analyze a model receptive field that displays this behavior, and in the second part experimental data are presented and analyzed with regard to the model. The model cortical receptive field in its simplest form contains (two rows) of geniculate X-cell-like, DOG (difference-of-Gaussians)-shaped, center-surround antagonistic, circular-input subunits. We propose nonlinear summation between these two subunits, by introducing a half-wave rectification stage before pooling. The model is tested for the responses it predicts for the application of counterphase-grating stimulation. This simple model predicts the appearance of three response forms as a function of counterphase-stimulation parameters. At periodic spatial frequencies the expected-response histogram has a single peak, whose amplitude has a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase. At spatial frequencies halfway between these, the expected-response histogram has two equal peaks whose amplitudes have a full-wave rectified sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase. At all intermediate spatial frequencies the expected-response histogram has a \"mixed\" form; the histogram appears sometimes with one peak, sometimes with two equal peaks, and generally with two peaks of unequal amplitude, as a function of spatial phase. Null responses are expected to appear at specific spatial phases only for the periodic spatial frequencies that give \"pure\" response time courses as in paragraph 5 above, and not in the more common mixed response case of paragraph 6. The analysis procedure described in the preceding paper (19) is used, separating the odd and even Fourier components of the response histograms reflecting the receptive-field intrasubunit linear summation and intersubunit nonlinear summation, respectively. We propose that this model may be used as a working hypothesis for the analysis of these aspects of the various cortical receptive-field types. Experimental data are described and discussed in terms of the model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "Receptive fields of simple cells in the cat visual cortex have recently been discussed in relation to the \u2018theory of communication' proposed by Gabor (1946). A number of investigators have suggested that the line-weighting functions, as measured orthogonal to the preferred orientation, may be best described as the product of a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoid (i.e. a Gabor function). Following Gabor\u2019s theory of \u2018basis\u2019 functions, it has also been suggested that simple cells can be categorized into even-and odd-symmetric categories. Based on the receptive field profiles of 46 simple cells recorded from cat visual cortex, our analysis provides a quantitative description of both the receptive-field envelope and the receptive-field \u2018symmetry\u2019 of each of the 46 cells. The results support the notion that, to a first approximation, Gabor functions with three free parameters (envelope width, carrier frequency and carrier phase) provide a good description of the receptive-field profiles. However, our analysis does not support the notion that simple cells generally fit into even- and odd-symmetric categories."

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for. This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)"

We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

For separations of less than 1.5 min, the addition of flanking lines facilitates bisection so that thresholds of less than 1 sec for discriminating the direction of offset could be reliably obtained. For larger separations an interval could be bisected to an accuracy of 1 part in 60. Experiments varying the length, luminance, and overlap of the lines suggest that different cues are used in these two regimes. A dual space-size analysis is presented that can account for these bisection thresholds over a wide range of experimental conditions. This quantitative analysis produces viewprints of the stimuli (analogous to the voiceprint of audition). Each viewprint shows the output of many spatial filters of different positions and sizes. A new filter shape is introduced that has advantages for modeling the visual system. The sensitivity of each filter is fixed by the contrast-response function. The analysis further shows that the limiting factors in spatial hyperacuity are both the contrast-response function and the spatial grain."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Contrast\u2010matching between different spatial frequencies was performed correctly (especially at frequencies above 5 c/deg) despite the attenuation by optical and neural factors which cause large differences in contrast thresholds. 3. Contrast\u2010matching between single lines of different widths was also veridical, and was not limited by the spatial integration (Ricco's Law) present at threshold. Adaptation to gratings altered the appearance of lines, and this could be best understood in Fourier terms. 4. The generality of these results was shown by matching the contrast of pictures which had been filtered so that each contained a one octave band of spatial frequencies. 5. Within the limits imposed by threshold and resolution, contrast\u2010matching was largely independent of luminance and position on the retina. 6. Six out of eleven astigmatic observers showed considerable suprathreshold compensation for their orientation\u2010specific neural deficit in contrast sensitivity. 7. These results define a new property of vision: contrast constancy. It is argued that spatial frequency channels in the visual cortex are organized to compensate for earlier attenuation. This achieves a dramatic 'deblurring' of the image, and optimizes the clarity of vision."

                "text": "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The activity of neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) has been recorded in anaesthetized cats in response to gratings of different profile and to single light and dark bars. 2. At very low spatial frequencies, outside the frequency response range to sinusoidal gratings, the response to square\u2010wave drifting gratings is obtainable from a combination of the response to the single bars of the grating presented in isolation. At higher spatial frequencies this is no longer true. 3. At very low spatial frequencies the responses to square\u2010wave gratings and to missing\u2010fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental harmonic) are very similar. 4. At spatial frequencies near the peak of the spatial frequency tuning curve of the cell, the responses to square\u2010wave grating and to sinusoidal gratings are very similar. At these spatial frequencies the response to the missing\u2010fundamental grating is practically zero. 5. At spatial frequencies lower than that of best sensitivity for the cell, the response to square\u2010wave gratings is correlated with the 1st and 3rd harmonic of the stimulus. 6. We conclude that at very low spatial frequencies of the grating the response of cortical cells is correlated with the light or dark edges (or light or dark bars) of the stimulus, because the edges contain high frequencies within the range of sensitivity of the cells. At higher spatial frequencies the results are interpreted best by assuming that cortical cells respond to the harmonics of the visual periodic stimulus. 7. When a background of dynamic visual noise is added to increase the spontaneous discharge of simple cells, their response to visual stimuli becomes linear or quasi\u2010linear.

Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly high, order. The result applies to zero and level crossings of linear differential operators of Gaussian filters. In this case the signal is determined uniquely, modulus the null space of the linear operator. The theorem can be extended to two-dimensional functions. These results are reminiscent of Logan\u2019s theorem [ Bell Syst. Tech. J.56, 487 ( 1977)]. They imply that extrema of derivatives at different scales are a complete representation of a signal. They are especially relevant for computational vision in the case of the Laplacian operator acting on image intensities, and they suggest rigorous foundations for the primal sketch."

This explanation equates Mach bands with distortions in a processed luminance distribution due to selective attenuation of low frequency components. But square waveforms exhibit no Mach bands2,5,6, although they should also be distorted after processing. Measurements of the contrast required to see Mach bands in trapezoidal waveforms and manipulations of their spectra lead us to conclude that phase relationships between Fourier components are important to the structure we perceive. A model based on the odd and even symmetry of visual receptive fields explains our results."

Furthermore, under a variety of conditions, such as when a signal is of finite length, phase information alone is sufficient to completely reconstruct a signal to within a scale factor. In this paper, we review and discuss these observations and results in a number of different contexts and applications. Specifically, the intelligibility of phase-only reconstruction for images, speech, and crystallographic structures are illustrated. Several approaches to justifying the relative importance of phase through statistical arguments are presented, along with a number of informal arguments suggesting reasons for the importance of phase. Specific conditions under which a sequence can be exactly reconstructed from phase are reviewed, both for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences, and algorithms for both approximate and exact reconstruction of signals from phase information are presented. A number of applications of the observations and results in this paper are suggested."

The number required is certainly no greater than 100 and may be much less1,2. A single rod requires only one photon to signal light3. A question which therefore arises is why do we not see punctate photon absorptions when we look at a very dim patch of light? The retina catches incident photons only sporadically in time, and therefore in space, when a source is very dim. If very few photons are sufficient to detect light, it might be expected that we should see isolated flashes of light, so that a patch of light appears mottled or speckled. Indeed, if a dim object is viewed on the screen of a cascaded image intensifier, so that each quantum caught by the cathode is amplified, we do see quanta as individual flashes or specks on the display phosphor2. This apparent contradiction creates a physiological problem ignored in most standard textbooks on vision although the issue has been raised4,5. We report here a possible solution; we have observed point sources of light set up one at a time very rapidly and at random by computer within a square patch on the face of an oscilloscope and find that as the luminance of the point sources is decreased the number of specks seen increases markedly, and that the appearance of motion, due presumably in the first place to the effect of the chance sequences of specks on motion-sensitive neurones, becomes weaker. We propose that at or near the threshold, the number of specks seen increases to infinity so that the specks crowd together to appear uniform and so the motion ceases."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

HEWITT found the value 1.71... listed for the integral (1) in HARDY & ROGOSINSKI [271, page 36. This anomaly, as well as others encountered in the literature, led us to a study of the GIBBS phenomenon and its history. In the course of this study we uncovered a maze of forgotten results, interesting and difficult generalizations, faulty constants, and some details about the GIBBS phenomenon that have escaped the attention of many writers on the subject. Despite the familiarity of our theme, we therefore entertain a hope that readers of the Archive will find some interest in a discussion of this corner of FOURIER analysis. The paper is divided into three Parts. In Part I, we examine GIBBS's phenomenon in some detail. In Part II, we take up its curious history and describe briefly some of its congeners. In Part III, we offer some conclusions. The computations given in this paper were carried out on two computers: a Hewlett-Packard 9810 and a Univac 1110. The graphs (barring the simplest) were drawn by a Hewlett-Packard 9862A plotter. All finite decimal expansions are truncated decimal expansions. It is a pleasure to record our indebtedness to GERALD B. FOLLAND, THOMAS L. HANKINS, EINAR HILLE, and STEPHEN P. KEELER, who have made valuable suggestions to us."
