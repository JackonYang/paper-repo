Syntactic analysis is used in Gobbledoc to divide each page into labeled rectangular blocks. Blocks labeled text are converted by OCR to obtain a secondary (ASCII) document representation. Since such symbolic files are better suited for computerized search than for human access to the document content and because too many visual layout clues are lost in the OCR process (including some special characters), Gobbledoc preserves the original block images for human browsing. Storage, networking, and display issues specific to document images are also discussed.<<ETX>>"

The basic idea is that connected components of black pixels can be used as computational units in document image analysis. In this paper, the problem of extracting words, textlines and text blocks is viewed as a clustering problem in the 2-dimensional discrete domain. Our main strategy is that profiling analysis is utilized to measure horizontal or vertical gaps of (groups of) components during the process of image segmentation. For this purpose, we compute the smallest rectangular box, called the bounding box, which circumscribes a connected component. Those boxes are projected horizontally and/or vertically, and local and global projection profiles are analyzed for word, textline and text-block segmentation. In the last step of segmentation, the document decomposition hierarchy is produced from these segmented objects."

DRS was developed on a personal computer (PC) with an adapter card for recognizing more than 3000 Kanji characters. It provides a flexible framework for object-oriented management of data and processing modules. The framework allows the user to change the combination of processing modules and to select pipelining (parallel processing) or sequential processing. DRS includes processing modules for layout analysis functions such as blob detection, block segmentation, and model matching, and for character recognition functions such as Kanji character recognition, Japanese postprocessing, postprocessing by a user, and error correction through a user interface. The character recognition functions on the card and the other processing-related recognition functions on the PC work cooperatively in the proposed framework. Within the basic framework, we have customized DRS for practical applications. Examples of successful applications-entry into a text database, creation of an electronic catalog, entry of family registration data, and entry of tag data in a manufacturing process-provide evidence of the processing accuracy and robustness of the framework."

These steps describe the conversion of the physical structure of a document into its logical structure. We have developed a computational model for document logical structure derivation, in which a rule-based control strategy utilizes the data obtained from analyzing a digitized document image, and makes inferences using a multi-level knowledge base of document layout rules. The knowledge-based document logical structure derivation system (DeLoS) based on this model consists of a hierarchical rule-based control system to guide the block classification, grouping and read-ordering operations; a global data structure to store the document image data and incremental inferences; and a domain knowledge base to encode the rules governing document layout."

It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"

Unlike the previous document segmentation methods where text spacing, border lines, and/or a priori layout models based template processing are performed, the present method begins with a hierarchy of partitioned image layers where inhomogeneous higher-level regions are recursively positioned into lower-level rectangular subregions and at the same time lower-level smaller homogeneous regions are merged into larger homogeneous regions. The present method differs from the traditional split-and-merge segmentation method in that it orthogonally splits regions using thresholds adaptively computed from projection profiles."

It does not make any assumptions about the shape of the regions as opposed to most earlier approaches which assume that printed regions are rectangular. It is capable of identifying and describing regions of complex shapes more accurately than existing methods. It requires no a priori knowledge. The background white space is covered with tiles and the contour of each region is identified by tracing through these white tiles that encircle it. The method can segment page images with severe skew without skew correction. The white tiles on the image can also be used in subsequent document analysis processes such as the classification of the image regions."

In this latter process, called layout analysis, only generic knowledge on typesetting conventions is exploited. Such knowledge is independent of the particular class of processed documents and turns out to be valuable for a wide range of documents. Preliminary results of the layout analysis system LEX (Layout EXpert) show the methodological validity of this approach."

Musical notation is governed by a substantial set of rules, but current systems fail to use them adequately. In complex scores, existing systems cannot overcome the well-known segmentation problems of document analysis, due mainly to the high density of music information. This paper proposes a new method of recognition which uses a grammar in order to formalize the syntactic rules and represent the context. However, where objects touch, there is a discrepancy between the way the existing knowledge (grammar) will describe an object and the way it is recognized, since touching objects have to be segmented first. Following a description of the grammar, this paper shall go on to propose the use of an operator to modify the way the grammar parses the image so that the system can deal with certain touching objects (e.g. where an accidental touches a notehead)."

Contrary to the bounding-box representation used in most past page segmentation and classification approaches which assume rectangular regions, there is a need for a more flexible description which also retains most of the functionality of the representation by rectangles. In the first part of this paper, the practical considerations of describing and handling the complex-shaped regions are examined and an appropriate representation scheme is proposed. For page classification, a new approach based on the description of white space inside regions is presented. In contrast to previous page classification approaches, skewed and complex-shaped regions are handled efficiently and the features are derived with no need for time-consuming accesses of the pixel-based image data."

Many different zoning techniques are now available but there is no robust method available to benchmark and evaluate them reliably. Our proposed strategy is a region-based approach, in which segmentation results are compared with manually generated \"ground truth files\", describing all possible correct segmentations. A segmentation ground truthing scheme has been proposed. The evaluation of segmentation quality is achieved by testing the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as the \"black\" pixels contained in the extracted polygons. An explicit specification of segmentation errors and a numerical evaluation are derived. The algorithm is simple and fast, and provides a multi-level output for each segmentation.<<ETX>>"

This is achieved by exploiting a small number of nearly universal typesetting and layout conventions. The system does not require prior knowledge of page orientation (module 90/spl deg/), and copes well with nonzero skew and shear angles (within 10/spl deg/). Also it locates blocks of text without reliance on detailed a priori layout models, and in spite of unknown or mixed horizontal and vertical text-line orientations. Within blocks, it infers text-line orientation and isolates lines, without knowledge of the language, symbol set, text sizes, or the number of text lines. Segmentation into words and symbols, and determination of reading order, normally require some knowledge of the language: this is held to minimum by relying on shape-driven algorithms. The underlying algorithms are based on Fourier theory, digital signal processing, computational geometry, and statistical decision theory. Most of the computation occurs within algorithms that possess unambiguous semantics (that is, heuristics are kept to a minimum). The effectiveness of the method on English, Japanese, Hebrew, Thai, and Korean documents is discussed.<<ETX>>"

The characteristics of the method are as follows: (1) thinning of the background enables us to represent white areas of any shape as connected thin lines or chains and the robustness for tilted page images is also achieved by the representation; and (2) based on this representation, the task of page segmentation is defined as to find the loops enclosing printed areas. The task is achieved by eliminating unnecessary chains using not only a feature of white areas, but also a feature of black areas divided by a chain. Based on the experimental results and the comparison with previous methods, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed method."

One of them is intelligent form analysis. This paper describes a generic system for form dropout when the filled-in characters or symbols are either touching or crossing the form frames. We propose a method to separate these characters from form frames whose locations are unknown. Since some of the character strokes are either touching or crossing the form frames, we need to address the following three issues: 1) localization of form frames; 2) separation of characters and form frames; and 3) reconstruction of broken strokes introduced during separation. The form frame is automatically located by finding long straight lines based on the block adjacency graph. Form frame separation and character reconstruction are implemented by means of this graph. The proposed system includes form structure learning and form dropout. First, a form structure-based template is automatically generated from a blank form which includes form frames, preprinted data areas and skew angle. With this form template, our system can then extract both handwritten and machine-typed filled-in data. Experimental results on three different types of forms show the performance of our system. Further, the proposed method is robust to noise and skew that is introduced during scanning."

Changing the target language may involve simultaneous changes in symbol sets, typefaces, sizes of text, page layouts, linguistic contexts, and imaging defects. The strategy has been to isolate the effects of these sources of variation within separate, independent engineering subsystems. In this way, it has been possible to construct, with a minimum of manual effort, classifiers for arbitrary combinations of symbols, typefaces, sizes, and imaging defects. An attempt has been made to rid the algorithms of all language-specific rules, relying instead on automatic learning from examples and generalized table-driven methods. For some tasks it has been feasible to avoid language dependency altogether. Linguistic context can be exploited through data-directed filtering algorithms in a uniform and modular manner, so that preexisting tools developed by computational linguistics can readily be applied. These principles are illustrated by trials on English, Swedish, Tibetan, and special technical texts. >"

The technique is being applied for the first time to segmenting newsprint, in order to locate the text regions for effective data capture. Previous methods applied to the task discussed in the paper, have used run-length encoding and block analysis, Gabor filters, or component analysis. The co-occurrence method offers significant advantages in processing time and ease of implementation."

Instead of top-down determination of the discriminating attributes, the system inspects a finite set of document instances that are presented to a learner in a bottom-up position. The learner itself figures out local similarities, rates them with respect to the overall structure, and determines the best structural match of two instances (neighborhood). The entire decision tree is grown step by step deducing subtrees by forming generalizations from a neighborhood.

This work concentrates on address block location for complex mail pieces with an arbitrary layout of printed entities. Using a bottom-up approach, a pyramid model is created for the address block. Based on this model, some features are extracted for assigning a confidence value to the located address blocks. The typical processing time for locating a destination address block is 0.1 seconds on a SGI Indy workstation."

The traditional approach, focusing on the correct classification of isolated characters, has been exhausted. The demonstration of the superiority of a new classification method under operational conditions requires large experimental facilities and databases beyond the resources of most researchers. In any case, even perfect classification of individual characters is insufficient for the conversion of complex archival documents to a useful computer-readable form. Many practical OCR tasks require integrated treatment of entire documents and well-organized typographic and domain-specific knowledge. New OCR systems should take advantage of the typographic uniformity of paragraphs or other layout components. They should also exploit the unavoidable interaction with human operators to improve themselves without explicit 'training'. >"

We solve the problem of finding an optimal set of masks by designing a neural network which is trained to maximize a relevant function. Two algorithms, the centroid algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm, are used to train the network. Experimental results on segmenting two natural textures and extracting barcodes in an image are reported, and the error rates compared for both the algorithms with different network configurations. The centroid algorithm gives better results in small parameter spaces, whereas the gradient descent algorithm works better with more parameters. Our method of automatically generating texture discrimination masks not only results in a good segmentation performance, but also reduces the dimensionality of the feature space compared to previously published multichannel filtering methods.<<ETX>>"

The shape symbol processing is carried out by means of shape processing, followed by shape symbol identification with the use of two symbol windows in the CAG.
