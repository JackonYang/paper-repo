This corpus is a collection of texts that comprise about one million word instances. The database includes 1,066 forms produced by approximately 400 different writers. A total of 82,227 word instances out of a vocabulary of 10,841 words occur in the collection. The database consists of full English sentences. It can serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. However, it is expected that the database would be particularly useful for recognition tasks where linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is used, because this knowledge can be automatically derived from the underlying corpus. The database also includes a few image-processing procedures for extracting the handwritten text from the forms and the segmentation of the text into lines and words."

Both strategies are based on an existing database of offline handwritten text, which includes handwriting samples different from whiteboard data. The two proposed strategies are MAP adaptation and merging of training sets. With these methods we can achieve improvements of the word recognition rate of up to 5.7%."

Notes written on a whiteboard is a new modality in handwriting recognition research that has received relatively little attention in the past. For the recognition we use an off-line HMM-recognizer, which has been developed in the context of our previous work. The recognizer is supplemented with methods for processing the on-line data and generating the images. The system consists of six main modules: on-line preprocessing, transformation to off-line data, off-line preprocessing, feature extraction, classification and post-processing. The recognition rate of the basic recognizer in a writer independent experiment is 59,5%. By applying state-of-the-art methods, such as optimizing the number of states and Gaussian components, and by including a language model we could achieve a statistically significant increase of the recognition rate to 64.3%."

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

We have developed such a dual on/off database, named IRONOFF. Currently, it contains a large number of isolated characters, digits, and cursive words written by French writers. We have designed this database so that, given an online point, it can be mapped at the correct location in the corresponding scanned image, and conversely, each offline pixel can be temporally indexed.

Our technique generates for each recognizer one general or several stroke-number specific characteristic functions. A simple warping process maps output scores into an ideal characteristic. A novelty of our approach is in using a characteristic based on the accumulated recognition rate, which makes our method very robust and stable to random errors in training data and requires no smoothing prior to normalization. In this paper we test our method on a large database named Kuchibue_d, a publicly available benchmark for on-line Japanese handwritten character recognition and very often used for benchmarking new methods."

Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms. Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

The input provided to an off-line handwriting recognition system is an image of a digit, a word, or - more generally -some text, and the system produces, as output, an ASCII transcription of the input. This task involves a number of processing steps, some of which are quite difficult. Typically, preprocessing, normalization, feature extraction, classification, and postprocessing operations are required. We'll survey the state of the art, analyze recent trends, and try to identify challenges for future research in this field."

The purpose of the project is to propose and implement solutions to the growing need of handwriting samples for online handwriting recognizers used by pen-based computers. Researchers from several companies and universities have agreed on a data format, a platform of data exchange and a protocol for recognizer benchmarks. The online handwriting data of concern may include handprint and cursive from various alphabets (including Latin and Chinese), signatures and pen gestures. These data will be compiled and distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium. The benchmarks will be arbitrated the US National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We give a brief introduction to the UNIPEN format. We explain the protocol of data exchange and benchmarks."

There are several multiclass discrimination problems, including handwritten numeral recognition with 10 classes, alphanumeral recognition with 36 classes, and touching-digit pair recognition with 100 classes. Word recognition with a lexicon is a problem where the number of classes varies from a few to about a thousand. Some of the discrimination techniques, particularly those with few classes, lend themselves well to neural network classification, while others are better handled by Bayesian polynomial and nearest-neighbor methods. This paper describes each of the discrimination problems and the performances of each of the subsystems in a handwritten address interpretation system developed at CEDAR."

We designed HLMs to be created using HLM components or a HLM template for teachers to create their original materials. Practical studies demonstrated that HLMs could be effectively used when children expressed and presented their ideas in a classroom and when they practiced calculations and characters by hand. We also investigated the application of a handwriting recognition technique to automatically check children's handwritten answers to drill materials. Using questionnaires, we confirmed that automatic checking not only saved time but also improved the children's motivation to learn. HLMs were enthusiastically embraced by both field teachers and children."

D-Pen requires a built-in intelligent character recognition (ICR) and can be applied to various data entry applications, such as middleware for paper-based data entry processes. Two important problems concerning the built-in ICR must therefore be solved: (1) support various character fields of business forms; (2) recognize various character-string entries in the fields. To solve these problems, a logical structural expression is defined to represent the logical relation among all the frames for characters, strings, and marks on a form. A method for layout-driven character string recognition based on a divide-and-conquer method was also developed. Evaluation tests with volunteers showed that the recognition rate for samples of 71 Japanese address name is 87% without any errors."

It is already possible, for instance, to rapidly locate task-related information during a meeting, filter it, and share it with remote users. Unfortunately, the technologies that provide such capabilities are as obstructive as they are useful - they force humans to focus on the tool rather than the task. Thus the veneer of utility often hides the true costs of use, which are longer, less focused human interactions. To address this issue, we present our current research efforts towards SMaRT: the Smart Meeting Room Task. The goal of SMaRT is to provide meeting support services that do not require explicit human-computer interaction. Instead, by monitoring the activities in the meeting room using both video and audio analysis, the room is able to react appropriately to users' needs and allow the users to focus on their own goals."
